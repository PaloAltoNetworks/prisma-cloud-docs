The cloud has changed how applications are collaboratively developed. The use of version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos, etc.) has grown exponentially. The CSPs provide customers with the ability to deploy and maintain their cloud services using scripting languages such as Terraform. These coding technologies and disciplines have introduced the “learn how to configure code security” feature to protect your IaC code opportunity of identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before they are compiled into applications or deployed as insecure cloud services. This approach to securing the development of code is frequently called “shifting left.” The building of cloud resources involves various technologies that span computational environments, such as virtual machine images, container images, and continuous integration build tools (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, CloudBees, etc.). Prisma Cloud provides DevSecOps stakeholders with the ability to securely build and maintain their cloud-based environments.

Implement the following Prisma Cloud capabilities to provide visibility and control within your organization's cloud coding and building practices:
