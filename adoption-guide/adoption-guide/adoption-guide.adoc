== Adoption Guide

This guide provides Prisma Cloud customers with a framework that establishes the pillars of security within their cloud journey.
It focuses on the Prisma Cloud Enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) suite of capabilities.
Prisma Cloud Enterprise is a Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that incorporates all the various cloud security disciplines (e.g., multi-cloud posture management, workload protection, micro segmentation, identity and access management, data security, etc.) into a unified, holistic service for the protection of your cloud resources.

The major cloud service providers (CSPs) each publish a cloud adoption framework (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/[Azure], https://cloud.google.com/adoption-framework[GCP], https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/CAF/[AWS]).
"Securing the cloud" is a pillar in each of these frameworks, and Prisma Cloud is a perfect fit for this pillar.
It is a multi- and hybrid-cloud solution that provides visibility and control across CSPs’ cloud-based services (code, VM, containers, serverless functions, identity, etc.).
Use Prisma Cloud to securely accelerate your organization’s cloud transformation journey.
