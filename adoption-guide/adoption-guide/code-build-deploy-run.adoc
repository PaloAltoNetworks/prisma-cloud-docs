== Code Build, Deploy, and Run

In this guide, we segment the cloud application’s lifecycle into the following categories:

* *Code & Build* – The CSPs provide the ability to codify the deployment, maintenance, and removal of cloud services (e.g., VMs, storage buckets, etc.). This is commonly referred to as infrastructure as code (IaC). You are responsible for the secure operation of your cloud services. Continuous Integration (CI) is a development lifecycle practice that has expanded with the growth of the cloud. CI provides your organization with the ability to rapidly and continuously develop, update, and maintain your cloud-based applications. The assembly and testing of your code into usable software packages are automated by CI systems (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI, CloudBees) that integrate with the different code repositories and package management systems. These CI systems produce deployable artifacts, such as IaC, VM images, Docker images, Serverless Images, etc., that are consumed by the release processes to drive frequent deployments. Prisma Cloud provides visibility and control within your Code & Build processes to identify vulnerabilities and compliance violations before progressing to the next phase of the application’s lifecycle.
* *Deploy* – Continuous deployment (CD) provides the automation of testing and deployment of applications within your clouds’ runtime environments. With modern automation, cloud applications are in a continuous cycle of development, testing, and release. This notion of continuous change is a fundamental challenge in managing cloud applications. Prisma Cloud identifies vulnerability and compliance issues within applications that are staged for deployment. With Prisma Cloud, you can enforce policies to ensure that only trusted applications are allowed to launch within the cloud runtime environment.
* *Run* – Applications run across the cloud workload continuum. Regardless of where they are deployed (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc.), the application’s runtime actions should be monitored for abnormal behaviors. Overly permissive cloud access roles present opportunities for attackers. Prisma Cloud quickly identifies expected behaviors and prevents anomalous behavior. It secures runtime environments using predictive and threat-based protections.
