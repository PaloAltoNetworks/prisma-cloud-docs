* *Integrate vulnerability and compliance checks within your CI tools.*
Scanning VMs, container images, and serverless functions in their earliest stage will allow you to fix issues before they are running in production. Use the Prisma Cloud CI plugin within the developers’ automation tools to scan for vulnerability and compliance issues. For example, developers can scan the packages and binaries that are compiled into the container images and immediately get detailed reports within their build pipelines, thus increasing your developers' security awareness. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/continuous_integration[Learn more about continuous integration with Prisma Cloud].

* *Detect drift within Infrastructure as Code cloud deployments.*
Drifts are inconsistencies in configuration that occur when resources are modified locally or manually using the CLI or console, and these divergences from the code are not recorded or tracked. The inconsistencies in code configuration can either be an addition or deletion of values from the template configuration in the source code. Code Security periodically scans your repositories to identify drifts that may occur between the build and deploy phases and enables you with corrective solutions to handle traceable configuration changes. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/drift-detection[Learn more about drift detection].

* *Prevent developers from committing hardcoded secrets.*
Prisma Cloud detects when secrets are committed from developers’ machines, branches, and build jobs. Your code is analyzed using prebuilt secrets detectors, built to identify the API keys, tokens, and passwords developers may be using when developing a cloud-native app. Enforce policy by halting a build process when a secret is found to ensure secrets have not been committed downstream in your CI/CD process and assess if the secret was compromised. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan[Learn how to monitor and fix issues in your scan].

* *Define your own vulnerability and compliance policies.*
Prisma Cloud includes out-of-the-box policies that enable you to detect misconfigurations and provide automated fixes for security issues across your integrated code repositories. You also have the flexibility to add new custom policies for your repositories and pipelines. As soon as you connect Code Security to your repositories, both out-of-the-box and custom policies are used to scan for potential issues. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/custom-build-policies[Learn more about how to create your own custom policies].

* *Analyze the runtime behavior of images before running in development and production environments.*
You are going to deploy an image into your environment, and you want to ensure that the image’s resulting container will not exhibit malicious behavior. With Prisma Cloud’s twistcli plugin, you can validate an image’s runtime behaviors within a sandboxed environment. Have confidence that your images will not exhibit malicious runtime behaviors before leaving the build phase. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/runtime_defense/image_analysis_sandbox[Learn more about Image Sandbox Analysis].
