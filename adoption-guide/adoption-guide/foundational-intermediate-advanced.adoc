== Foundational, Intermediate, and Advanced

This guide categorizes Prisma Cloud capabilities that are recommended to be implemented within the cloud disciplines of code & build, deploy, and run. This framework’s cloud adoption phases are:

* *Foundational* – Your organization has started its cloud adoption journey. You are presented with the challenge of effectively managing assets within the cloud and on-premises. Prisma Cloud Enterprise provides your organization with the visibility, tools, and knowledge to develop a strong and secure cloud adoption foundation.

* *Intermediate* – Prisma Cloud supports your organization’s progression of understanding and adopting cloud-based technologies. Effectively manage the vulnerabilities and compliance of your cloud-based resources. Use Prisma Cloud to secure cloud capabilities that advance beyond the traditional infrastructure as a service architecture.

* *Advanced* – Your organization is innovating its business with the cloud, and this is supported by the industry-leading capabilities of Prisma Cloud Enterprise. Proactively control your cloud operations, and identify and remediate issues before they manifest within your runtime environments.

The cloud has introduced a new discipline to cybersecurity and the total cost of ownership. Organizations can quickly utilize technologies that would have taken years to implement in a traditional on-premises environment.

The ownership of responsibility between the CSP and the customer is dependent upon the technology (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS). Prisma Cloud provides consistent security across the ownership responsibility gradient dependent upon the technology. It secures all these technologies, giving the customer confidence in their cloud transformation journey. This guide is intended for all organizational cloud stakeholders. With Prisma Cloud, Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) practitioners have a common platform to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover their cloud-based infrastructure, services, and workloads.
