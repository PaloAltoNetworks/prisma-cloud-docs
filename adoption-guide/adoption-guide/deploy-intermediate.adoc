* *Enforce vulnerability and compliance policies.*
Prisma Cloud container Defenders enforce your organization’s policies to ensure non-compliant images are not allowed to instantiate as running containers. You can create policies to block specific vulnerabilities and/or compliance findings. You can allow exceptions and grace periods for findings that are migrated through other controls. Enforce your organization’s vulnerability and compliance policies ensuring the secure operations of your services. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/vuln_management_rules[Learn more about policy enforcement].
