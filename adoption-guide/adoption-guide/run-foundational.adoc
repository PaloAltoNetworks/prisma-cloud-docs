* *Gain visibility into your cloud services and assets running within your cloud environments.*
Onboarding allows Prisma Cloud to query your CSP’s API endpoints to collect configuration, network, and audit data. This information is used to identify vulnerable configurations, suspicious network traffic, and anomalous behaviors within your cloud infrastructure. Supported cloud service providers are Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud[Learn more about onboarding your cloud accounts].

* *See all cloud resources across all clouds in a single pane of glass.*
You need to have complete visibility into every deployed resource and absolute confidence in the configuration status of your multiple cloud environments. Therefore, maintaining a current inventory of deployed resources and gaining centralized visibility across cloud environments are essential for your cloud operations. From the single dashboard, you gain operational insight over all our cloud infrastructure, including assets and services. Prisma Cloud also maintains a history of configuration changes, enabling users to understand exactly when a new security issue was introduced and by whom, to simplify cloud forensics and auditing. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-dashboards/asset-inventory[Learn more about cloud inventory management].

* *Quickly identify vulnerabilities without deploying agents.*
Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a virtual machine without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the instance. Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on AWS, GCP, and Azure hosts for vulnerabilities. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/agentless_scanning[Learn more about Agentless scanning].

* *Identify vulnerability and compliance issues within serverless functions.*
Serverless computing has gained popularity due to cloud providers dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources. Serverless architectures delegate operational responsibilities to the cloud provider. However, you are responsible for the vulnerabilities in your code and associated dependencies. Prisma Cloud scans your cloud-based serverless functions without the deployment of Defenders. Prisma Cloud supports AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[Learn more about serverless function scanning].

* *Check your cloud environments against compliance standards.*
Onboard your cloud accounts to quickly review, manage, and enforce compliance standards across multi-cloud environments in realr-time based on your regulated industry’s standards. Prisma Cloud supports more than 20 compliance standards, including PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, NIST 800-171, NIST 800-53, NIST CSF, ISO 27002, CCPA, CCM, and custom frameworks. You can create compliance reports and run them immediately, or schedule them on a recurring basis to measure your compliance over time. You can also track your vulnerability issues and ensure your cloud environment is secure and void of misconfiguration mistakes. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-compliance[Learn more about compliance standards].

* *Work towards Zero Trust by reviewing net-effective permissions and removing excessive permissions for all user and resource identities.*
In the public cloud, overly permissive roles, poor credential hygiene, and accidental public exposure have caused significant enterprise breaches. Gaining visibility into net-effective permissions across cloud providers is a complex task. The security operations team needs to apply and maintain the principle of least privilege in highly dynamic multi-cloud environments. Prisma Cloud provides broad visibility into effective permissions, continuously monitors cloud environments for risky and unused entitlements, and automatically makes least-privilege recommendations. You can query all relevant identities, including all the relationships among different entities and their effective permissions, in the cloud environments. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security[Learn more about Prisma Cloud cloud entitlements management].

* *Ensure that data stored in the cloud is secure and does not contain sensitive information or malware.*
The near-limitless capacity offered by cloud storage services has enabled organizations to store significant amounts of data, amplifying the challenges of traditional, lengthy, and error-prone manual processes for classification. The risks of cloud storage services, from misconfiguration to sensitive data to malware to suspicious user activities, are challenging to assess and remediate without a single consolidated view. Prisma Cloud Data Security is purpose-built to address the challenges of discovering and protecting data at the scale and velocity common in public cloud environments. It enables the discovery and classification of data stored in AWS S3 buckets and protects against accidental exposure, misuse, or sharing of sensitive data. In addition to protecting your confidential and sensitive data, your data is also protected against threats—known and unknown (zero-day) malware using Palo Alto Networks WildFire service. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security[Learn more about Prisma Cloud’s data security capabilities].
