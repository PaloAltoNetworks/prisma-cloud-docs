After Prisma Cloud upgrades your Microsegmentation Console, you should upgrade all apoctl clients.
Otherwise, you may experience unexpected behavior.
The upgrade of apoctl consists of a simple xref:../start/install-apoctl.adoc[reinstall].

Upgrading the enforcers is optional as older enforcers can continue to communicate with newer Microsegmentation Consoles.
