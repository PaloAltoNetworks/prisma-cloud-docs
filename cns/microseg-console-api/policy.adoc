=== policy/enforcerconfig

==== EnforcerProfile

Allows you to create reusable configuration profiles for your enforcers.
Enforcer profiles contain various startup information that can (for some)
be updated live. Enforcer profiles are assigned to enforcers using a
enforcer profile mapping.

=== policy/files

==== FileAccessPolicy

A file access policy allows processing units to access various folder and files.
It will use the tags of a file path to know what is the path of the file or
folder to allow access to. You can allow the processing unit to have any
combination of read, write, or execute.

When a processing unit is a Docker container, then it will police the volumes.
Mount and execute won't have any effect.

File paths are not supported yet for standard Linux processes.

(i.e., anywhere), use `0.0.0.0/0` as the address and `1-65000` for the ports.
You must assign the external network one or more tags. These allow you to
reference the external network from your network policies.

==== InfrastructurePolicy

Infrastructure policies represent the network access rules of the underlying
infrastructure. They can assist you in analyzing how AWS security groups,
firewalls, and other access control list (ACL) mechanisms may affect
Microsegmentation network policies. Microsegmentation's AWS integration
app automatically populates AWS security groups.

The APIs can be defined as the `RESTAPISpec` or similar specifications for other
layer 7 protocols.

====== `exposedPort` [`required`,`max_value=65535.000000`]

Type: `integer`

The port that the service can be accessed on. Note that this is different from
the `port` attribute that describes the port that the service is actually

the port that the load balancer is listening for the service, whereas the
port that the implementation is listening on can be different.

====== `exposedServiceIsTLS`

Indicates that the exposed service is TLS. This means that the enforcer has to
initiate a TLS session in order to forward traffic to the service.

Default value:

[,json]

false
----

Indicates if this is an external service.

Default value:

false
----

Type: `boolean`

Defines if the object is protected.

====== `publicApplicationPort` [`max_value=65535.000000`]

Type: `integer`

A new virtual port that the service can be accessed on using HTTPS. Since the
enforcer transparently inserts TLS in the application path, you might want
to declare a new port where the enforcer listens for TLS. However, the
application does not need to be modified and the enforcer will map the
traffic to the correct application port. This is useful when
an application is being accessed from a public network.

====== `redirectURLOnAuthorizationFailure`

Type: `string`

If this is set, the user will be redirected to that URL in case of any
authorization failure, allowing you to provide a nice message to the user.
The query parameter `?failure_message=<message>` will be added to that
