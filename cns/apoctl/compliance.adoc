== `+compliance+` subcommand

The `+compliance+` subcommand allows you to create simple compliance
reports based on the policies associated with a namespace. The
report can be exported either as a table or in CSV format.

You must provide a list of tag selectors that will select the
processing units for which the compliance report must be run.
The default output format is a table.

Examples:

 apoctl reports compliance --selector \$identity=processingunit --selector type=aporeto --format=csv
