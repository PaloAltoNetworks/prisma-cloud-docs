=== New Features

* Better exception reporting. Report a connection exception between a PU and external network (within target networks) caused by missing TCP Fast Open enablement in a Next Generation Firewall in the data path.

* Enable TFO discovery by default. TCP Fast Open discovery is now enabled by default and there is no need to pass additional parameters to the enforcer during installation time.

=== Resolved Issues

* *CNS-5306*: Only Refresh PUs for necessary enforcer profile changes.
* *CNS-5419*: Enforcer is sending tokens as GET parameters instead of cookies.
* *CNS-5305*: Enforcer profile update triggers two event calls.
* *CNS-5399*: Nfqueue alarm during upgrade of enforcer.
* *CNS-4916*: Not all enforcer cgroups are monitored for tampering.

=== Known Issues

* *CNS-5585*: iptables-restore is failing with "too many ports" error.
* *CNS-5584*: Proxy protocol header can not be removed from connection.
