=== New Features

* Better exception reporting: When a next generation firewall (NGFW) without the TFO option is detected, a connection report is issued for the connection between the processing unit (PU) and an external network.

* Enable TFO discovery by default: TCP Fast Open discovery is now enabled by default and you don't need to provide any additional parameters to the Enforcer during installation.

=== Resolved Issues

* *CNS-5306*: Only Refresh PUs for necessary Enforcer profile changes.
* *CNS-5419*: Enforcer sends tokens as GET parameters instead of cookies.
* *CNS-5305*: Enforcer profile update triggers two event calls.
* *CNS-5399*: Nfqueue alarm during Enforcer upgrade.
* *CNS-4916*: Not all Enforcer cgroups are monitored for tampering.

=== Known Issues

* *CNS-5585*: `iptables-restore` is failing with "too many ports" error.
* *CNS-5584*: Proxy protocol header can not be removed from connection.
