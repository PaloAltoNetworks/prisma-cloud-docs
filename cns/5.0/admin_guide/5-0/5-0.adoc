Prisma Cloud Identity-Based Microsegmentation protects cloud applications from attack by authenticating and authorizing all communications with a cryptographically-signed identity assigned to every workload.
Microsegmentation alleviates reliance on unmanageable, error-prone policies based on IP addresses.
It enforces a distributed, homogeneous security policy per workload independent of network or infrastructure configuration, enabling uniform security orchestration across multi-cloud environments.
