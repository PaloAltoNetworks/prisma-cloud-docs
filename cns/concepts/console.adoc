The Microsegmentation Console manages all Microsegmentation resources.
You can access it from three interfaces.

* *Web interface*: a web application accessed through your browser that allows you to define all resources, as well as view a visual representation of all applications that are protected by Microsegmentation.
All possible actions in the web interface may be alternatively performed by scripts instead.
* *Command line*: `apoctl` is the Microsegmentation command line interface (CLI).
It supports completion as well as various other commands that will help you automate everything.
* *REST API*: the Microsegmentation Console API allows programmatic manipulation of all parts of the system.
Both the web interface and `apoctl` act as clients of the Microsegmentation Console API.
