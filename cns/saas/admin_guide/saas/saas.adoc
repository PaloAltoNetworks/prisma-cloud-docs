Prisma Cloud Identity-Based Microsegmentation authenticates and authorizes all communications with a cryptographically-signed identity. Every one of your workloads has such an identity to protect your cloud applications from attack.

Using microsegmentation you don't need to rely on unmanageable, error-prone policies based on IP addresses.

Enforcing a distributed, homogeneous security policy per workload independent of network or infrastructure configuration, you enable uniform security orchestration across multi-cloud environments.
