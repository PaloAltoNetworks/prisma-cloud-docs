=== Policy

The policy system is based on the concept of delegation. Consider the following scenario. There are two applications managed by two seperate devops teams
called appA and appB. The appA team needs to talk to an application owned by appB. The appA team should create a policy in their namespace to allow this
flow. The appB team should create a coresponding policy in their namespace to allow this flow. This creates a system of checks and balances and allows
the devops teams to create policy without the need for the secops teams to intervene.
