== Policy System

The policy system is based on the concept of delegation.

For example, consider the following scenario.

* You have two separate development operations (devops) teams.

* Each devops team manage a separate application.

** Application A (appA) is managed by devops team A

** Application B (appB) is managed by devops team B

* Devops team A needs to talk to an application owned by devops team B.

Then, the following policies should be created.

* Then the appA team should create a policy in their namespace to allow this flow.
* The appB team should create a corresponding policy in their namespace to allow this flow.

These policies create a system of checks and balances and allows the devops teams to create policies without the security operations teams having to intervene.
