=== Basics

Network rulesets allow you to control layer 3 and 4 traffic between:

* Processing units
* Processing units and external networks

=== Processing units and external networks

Processing units represent hosts or pods protected by enforcers.
External networks represent hosts without enforcers.
Because external networks don't have enforcers, you can't control their attempts to initiate or accept connections.
However, you can control whether processing units:

* Initiate connections to external networks.
* Accept connections from external networks.

=== Defining network rulesets

Each network ruleset must have at least one subject, rule, and object.

* *Subject*: must be a processing unit
* *Rule*: can be incoming or outgoing
* *Object*: can be an external network or a processing unit

The following diagram illustrates the syntax and enforcement of network rulesets.

For simplicity, the diagram shows a ruleset with just one subject, two rules, and two objects.
A ruleset can have multiple subjects, incoming rules, outgoing rules, and objects.

=== Selecting subjects and objects

Use xref:tags-and-identity.adoc[Microsegmentation tags] to select the subjects and objects of your network rulesets.
While you apply tags to external networks manually, Microsegmentation automatically adds a number of tags to processing units.
The Microsegmentation Console web interface allows you to browse through the tags assigned to each processing unit.
You can also retrieve them with `apoctl` or your own custom client application.

You may find a single tag serves your purpose or you can connect them with `AND` and `OR` to form boolean expressions.
An example of a boolean expression for the subject (referred to as *Applies to* in the web interface) follows.

You can also work with network rulesets as YAML objects and exchange them with the Microsegmentation Console API using `apoctl` or your own custom application.
Examples of subject and object selection in YAML syntax follow.

Single tag:

[,yaml]
----
name: Allow internet to front end
subject:
- - 'app=frontend'
incomingRules:
- action: Allow
  object:
  - - 'externalnetwork:name=internet'
----

Tags with AND relationship:

[,yaml]
----
name: Allow internet to front end
subject:
- - 'app=frontend'
  - '$identity=processingunit'
incomingRules:
- action: Allow
  object:
  - - 'externalnetwork:name=internet'
    - '$identity=externalnetwork'
----

Tags with AND and OR relationships:

[,yaml]
----
name: Allow shopping cart or ad service to redis
subject:
- - 'app=cartservice'
  - '$identity=processingunit'
- - 'app=adservice'
  - '$identity=processingunit'
outgoingRules:
- action: Allow
  object:
  - - 'app=redis'
    - '$identity=processingunit'
----

[TIP]
====
Observe how the hyphens allow you to specify AND and OR relationships between the tags.

[#_tag-prefixes]
=== Tag prefixes

The `tagPrefixes` namespace property specifies the xref:tags-and-identity.adoc[Microsegmentation tags] you can use to select subjects and objects.
If the beginning of a tag matches one of the tag prefixes, you can use it.
For example, you can use the tag `$namespace=/{parent-ns}/{child-ns}/k8s-cluster-01/hipster-shop` because `$namespace=` is one of the default tag prefixes.

By default, each namespace has the following tag prefixes:

`$controller=`, `$id=`, `$identity=`, `$image=`, `$namespace=`, `$type=`, `@org:cloudaccount=`, `@org:group=`,`@org:kubernetes=`,`@org:tenant=`, `app:host:type=` , `app=`, `externalnetwork:name=`.


You can manually add additional tag prefixes to a namespace as follows.


Syntax:

[,console]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api update namespace <NAMESPACE> -n <PARENT> -f -
name: <NAMESPACE>
namespace: <PARENT>
tagPrefixes: ["<PREFIX>","<PREFIX>"]
EOF
----

Example:

[,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api update namespace /{parent-ns}/{child-ns}/k8s/hipster-shop -n /{parent-ns}/{child-ns}/k8s -f -
name: /{parent-ns}/{child-ns}/k8s/hipster-shop
namespace: /{parent-ns}/{child-ns}/k8s
tagPrefixes: ["app=","pod-template-hash="]
EOF
----

Note that to modify a namespace, you must have namespace editor permissions in its parent.

=== Defining external networks

Microsegmentation offers multiple ways of defining an external network.

* *Domain name*: Use a domain name when available for greater resiliency.
Microsegmentation also supports wildcards for subdomains, represented with an asterisk.
For example, an external network defined as `{asterisk}.googleapis.com` would contain the traffic between processing units and `cloudprofiler.googleapis.com`, `clouddebugger.googleapis.com`, `cloudtrace.googleapis.com`, etcetera.
Microsegmentation disallows the following syntactical variations: `{asterisk}googleapis.com`, `googleapis{asterisk}.com`, and `googleapis.{asterisk}`.
You can only wildcard one subdomain.
* *IP address*: Within an internal network, some servers get assigned a static IP address, such as DNS servers.
In addition, many cloud providers use the same link-local IP address for their metadata endpoints.
In such cases, use the IP address to define the external network.
Example: `169.254.169.254`.
* *Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation*: You may have an IP address range on an internal network that is relatively stable.
For example, in Kubernetes, certain ranges of cluster IP addresses are reserved for pods.
You can obtain these CIDRs by running `kubectl cluster-info dump | grep -i podCIDR`
* *Automation (advanced)*: The public IP address ranges used by vendors to provide various services may change.
Many vendors may publish and update their current list of CIDRs.
You can use an Microsegmentation automation to retrieve the latest CIDRs from the vendor and keep your external network definition up to date.
For example, content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudfront publish their IP address ranges at `+https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json+` and CloudFlare publishes its ranges at `+https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4+`.
You can find an example of such an automation in xref:../secure/block-malicious-ips.adoc[Blocking malicious IPs].

=== Enforcer network ruleset retrieval and storage

Each time a network ruleset gets updated, the Microsegmentation Console sends the enforcer a push notification to retrieve the latest.
The enforcer also checks every ten minutes to see if anything has changed.
If the enforcer loses its connection to the Microsegmentation Console, it continues enforcing the last network rulesets that it received.

=== Order of precedence

We expect you to start in discovery mode, with all traffic allowed and represented in the Microsegmentation Console web interface with dashed green lines.
After allowing the desired traffic, you should disable discovery mode.
We describe how to allow the traffic and disable discovery mode in xref:../secure/hosts.adoc[Securing host communications] and xref:../secure/k8s.adoc[Securing a Kubernetes namespace].

This section focuses on ruleset resolution once discovery mode has been disabled.
For each request, the enforcer checks its local store of network rulesets to find one that matches.
It may find multiple matches.
If so, it resolves these as follows.

image::netruleset-resolution.png[width=700]

Once you have disabled discovery mode, Microsegmentation denies all traffic by default.
If the enforcer does not find a rule allowing the traffic, it denies it.

If you have both an allow and reject rule that matches, the reject rule takes precedence.

=== Propagation

You can choose to propagate a network ruleset to children namespaces.
Propagation reduces manual work effort and allows the operators to ensure that the children conform to basic security requirements.
See xref:namespaces.adoc[Microsegmentation namespaces] for additional discussion.

Refer to xref:../secure/block-malicious-ips.adoc[Blocking malicious IPs] for an example of a good candidate for propagation.

=== Best Practices

It is a best practive to create an external network with an IP CIDR and not a DNS hostname if possible. This is because the enforcer intercepts DNS request to map the name to the IP and situations may occur where the enforcer does not observe this request. Some misbehaving applications will perform a single DNS lookup and cache the result. If the enforcer is not running when the initial lookup is performed it will not be noted by the enforcer.
