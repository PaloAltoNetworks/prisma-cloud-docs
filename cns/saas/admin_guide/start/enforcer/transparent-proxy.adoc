=== Enable non-transparent proxy support
Enforcers require access to Prisma Cloud in order to send telemetry data and receive updates and in some environments this can only be achieved through a non-transparent proxy.

Enforcers support adding a proxy endpoint during install, in order to support such use cases.

[NOTE]
TLS terminating proxies are not supported.

During the Enforcer installation, expand the Advanced option and add the proxy information, as follows:

* Proxy Address — IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the proxy server, alongside the protocol and port information: example http://proxy.example.com:8080

* Proxy Credential— User and Password credentials for proxies that require authentication (optional)

* Proxy Server CA — When the proxy server requires a private CA certificate to be used during connection (optional). Upload the proxy certificate in .pem file format.
