== Enabling non-transparent proxy support

Enforcers require access to the Prisma Cloud Console to send telemetry data and receive updates. In some environments, you can only achieve this through a non-transparent proxy.

Enforcers support adding a proxy endpoint during installation to support this use case.

[NOTE]
====
TLS terminating proxies are not supported.
====

During the Enforcer installation, expand the *Advanced* option and add the following proxy information.

* *Proxy Address:* IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the proxy server including the protocol and port information. For example: http://proxy.example.com:8080

* *Proxy Credential:* (Optional) Username and password for your proxy server, if authentication is required.

* *Proxy Server CA:* (Optional) If your proxy server requires connections to use a private Certificate Authority (CA) certificate, upload the proxy certificate using the `.pem` file format.
