=== Enable non-transparent proxy support
Enforcers require access to the Prisma Cloud Console to send telemetry data and receive updates. In some environments, you can only achieve this through a non-transparent proxy.

Enforcers support adding a proxy endpoint during installation to support this use case.

[NOTE]
====
TLS terminating proxies are not supported.
====

During the Enforcer installation, expand the *Advanced* option and add the following proxy information.

* *Proxy Address:* IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the proxy server including the protocol and port information. For example: `http://proxy.example.com:8080`

* Proxy Credential— User and Password credentials for proxies that require authentication (optional)

* Proxy Server CA — When the proxy server requires a private CA certificate to be used during connection (optional). Upload the proxy certificate in .pem file format.
