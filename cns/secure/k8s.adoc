=== About securing a Kubernetes namespace

We deploy enforcers in discovery mode, a very permissive initial configuration.
This allows your pods to function as they did before you deployed the enforcer, with no impact to their accustomed communications.

We recommend allowing your namespace to run in discovery mode for some time, perhaps a week.
During this interval, the IP addresses, protocols, and ports of its communications collect in the Microsegmentation Console.
This helps you compose a comprehensive list of the minimum allowed communications, ensuring a seamless experience when you disable discovery mode.
After disabling discovery mode, enforcers reject any traffic not explicitly allowed.

After letting the enforcer collect flow logs for some time, complete this section in sequence.
First allow the desired traffic, then disable discovery mode.

Before you begin, we recommend reviewing link:../concepts/network-rulesets.adoc[basic network ruleset concepts].

We use Google's https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo[Hipster Shop] for our examples.
If you don't have a Kubernetes namespace with pods running, complete the following steps to deploy the Hipster Shop so you can follow along.

=== Deploy the Hipster Shop (optional)

If you already have pods in your namespace, you can <<allow-domain-name-system-communications,skip to the next section>>.

. Ensure that your target cluster has at least five nodes.
Commands to scale some popular Kubernetes deployments follow.

[GKE]
----

[,console]
----
gcloud container clusters resize $CLUSTER_NAME --num-nodes=5
gcloud container clusters update $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=5 --max-nodes=10
----

----
[EKS]
----

[,console]
----
eksctl scale nodegroup --cluster=$CLUSTER_NAME --nodes=5 --name=$NODE_GROUP
----

----
[AKS]
----

[,console]
----
az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count 5 --nodepool-name $NODE_POOL
----

----


. Create a Kubernetes namespace for the Hipster Shop.
+
[,console]
----
 kubectl create namespace hipster-shop
----

. Deploy the Hipster Shop.
+
[,console]
----
 kubectl apply -n hipster-shop \
               -f "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/master/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml?raw=true"
----

. Issue the following command to observe the progress of the deployment.
+
[,console]
----
 watch kubectl get pods -n hipster-shop
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can also use kubectl's `--watch` flag, but the regular `watch` command works better.
If you don't have it installed, we recommend doing so.
====

. Once all of the pods achieve `Running` status, press CTRL+C to exit the `watch` interface.
[TIP]
====
Be patient.
Some pods may go into a `CrashLoopBackOff` and restart a few times but should still reach `Running` status.
If not, you may need to add more nodes to your cluster.
====
. Obtain the public IP address of the front end service.
+
[,console]
----
 watch kubectl get service/frontend-external -n hipster-shop
----

. Once an `EXTERNAL-IP` gets assigned, press CTRL+C to exit the `watch` command.
. Paste the IP address or domain shown under `EXTERNAL-IP` into your browser prefixed with `http://`.
Example: `+http://35.203.153.201+`
. Exercise the application by making a purchase.
. Open the {{% console-web-interface %}}, select {{% platform-app-dep-map %}} in the side navigation menu, and navigate to the hipster shop namespace.
. Remove the default grouping expression so you can see your pods.

=== Allow domain name system communications

After allowing the flow logs to collect, you will likely observe multiple green dashed lines to the *Somewhere* external network.
Clicking the lines for more details, you'll probably see that many are to the same IP address and use port 53.
Researching the IP address in question, you'll soon realize that these are domain name system (DNS) queries.
In the following procedure we describe how to enable access to the DNS server of your Kubernetes cluster.

[TIP]
====
If you do not see DNS queries, `exec` into one of your pods and run `curl google.com`.
====

. Set an `APP_NS` environment variable containing the Microsegmentation namespace of your application.
This should be a great-grandchild namespace.
The fourth segment is your Kubernetes namespace.
In our example, we have a Hipster Shop microservice application in the `hipster-shop` Kubernetes namespace.
+
[,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
 export APP_NS=/{{< parent-ns >}}/{child-ns}/k8s/hipster-shop
----

. Set a `CLUSTER_NS` to the grandchild level, one level above your current namespace.
+
[,console, subs="+attributes"]
----
 export CLUSTER_NS=/{{< parent-ns >}}/{child-ns}/k8s
----

. Set a `DNS_SERVER_IP` environment variable containing the IP address of the DNS server.
+
[,console]
----
export DNS_SERVER_IP=10.75.240.10
----

. Use the following command to create an external network representing the DNS server.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: DNS
 entries:
 - $DNS_SERVER_IP
 associatedTags:
 - externalnetwork:name=dns
 EOF
----

. Use the following command to create a network ruleset explicitly allowing all processing units in the Kubernetes namespace to initiate connections with the *DNS* external network.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkrulesetpolicy -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: allow-dns
 subject:
 - - \$identity=processingunit
   - \$namespace=$APP_NS
 outgoingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - externalnetwork:name=dns
   protocolPorts:
   - udp/53
 EOF
----

. Open the {{% console-web-interface %}} and click *App Dependency Map*.
You should see an external network named *DNS* appear with solid green lines.
When you click the line for more details, you'll see that your ruleset was applied.
Compare the time stamps for *Somewhere* and *DNS*.
The *DNS* time stamps should be newer.
The *DNS* external network contains all of your DNS flows going forward.
[TIP]
====
You may need to wait for a few minutes for the DNS queries to occur.
====
 image:/img/screenshots/net-ruleset-k8s-dns-ok.gif[DNS OK]

=== Allow pods in namespace

Next, let's allow the pods in this namespace to communicate with each other.

. Use the following command to create a network ruleset that allows all the pods in the namespace to communicate.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkrulesetpolicy -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: allow-pods-in-namespace
 subject:
 - - \$identity=processingunit
   - \$namespace=$APP_NS
 outgoingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - \$identity=processingunit
     - \$namespace=$APP_NS
   protocolPorts:
   - any
 incomingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - \$identity=processingunit
     - \$namespace=$APP_NS
   protocolPorts:
   - any
 EOF
----

. Exercise the application to create new flows.
. In the {{% console-web-interface %}}, select *App Dependency Map*.
You should see solid green lines between the pods.
Click one of them and check the ruleset that was applied.
[TIP]
====
You may need to exercise the application, wait a little while, and shorten the time window to see the solid green lines.
====
+

=== Allow metadata service

When using a managed cloud provider, you may notice connections to their instance metadata endpoint.
GCP, AWS, and Azure use the link-local address 169.254.169.254.
Let's go ahead and allow these connections.

. Create an external network to represent the metadata service.
The following assumes a metadata IP address of 169.254.169.254.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: metadata
 entries:
 - 169.254.169.254
 associatedTags:
 - externalnetwork:name=metadata
 EOF
----

. Create a network ruleset allowing any pod in your namespace to initiate connections to the `metadata` external network.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkrulesetpolicy -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: allow-metadata
 subject:
 - - \$namespace=$APP_NS
   - \$identity=processingunit
 outgoingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - externalnetwork:name=metadata
   protocolPorts:
   - "tcp/80"
 EOF
----

. After some time, you should see a new `metadata` external network appear with solid green lines to requesting pods.
[TIP]
====
You may need to exercise the application, wait a little while, and shorten the time window to see the solid green lines.
====
 image:/img/screenshots/net-ruleset-k8s-metadata-allowed.gif[Metadata ok]

=== Allow external services

Often, pods may connect to services outside of the cluster.
For example, on GKE, the Hipster Shop microservice application connects to a variety of Google APIs.
We recommend using DNS records to allow the connections whenever possible, as IP addresses can change.

. In the {{% console-web-interface %}}, expand *Monitor*, select *Logs*, then select *DNS Lookup Logs*.
. Review the domain names listed under *Resolved Name*.
. Create an external network to represent the external service.
In the following example, we use a wildcard (`*`) to allow any subdomain of `googleapis.com`.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: googleapis
 entries:
 - '*.googleapis.com'
 associatedTags:
 - externalnetwork:name=googleapis
 EOF
----

. Create a network ruleset to allow the traffic.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkrulesetpolicy -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: allow-googleapis
 subject:
 - - \$namespace=$APP_NS
   - \$identity=processingunit
 outgoingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - externalnetwork:name=googleapis
   protocolPorts:
   - "tcp/443"
 EOF
----

. Return to the {{% console-web-interface %}} and select *App Dependency Map*.
You should see the external network you just created appear with solid green lines to requesting pods.
[TIP]
====
You may need to exercise the application, wait a little while, and shorten the time window to see the solid green lines.
====
 image:/img/screenshots/net-ruleset-k8s-googleapis-allowed.gif[Google APIs ok]

=== Allow web server

If your namespace includes a web server, complete the following steps to allow access.

. Create an external network to represent the IP addresses used by requesting parties.
In this case, it is a public web server, so we use `0.0.0.0/0`.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: internet
 entries:
 - 0.0.0.0/0
 associatedTags:
 - externalnetwork:name=internet
 EOF
----

. In the {{% console-web-interface %}}, click the processing unit representing the web server and examine its tags.
Look for a tag that uniquely identifies the web server, persists through time, and matches a link:../../concepts/network-rulesets/#tag-prefixes[tag prefix].
+
image::net-ruleset-k8s-webserver-meta.gif[Examine tags]

. In the case of the Hipster Shop, the `app=frontend` Kubernetes label represents the best unique identifier for our web server but it does not match any of the default tag prefixes.
Use the following command to add an `app=` tag prefix to your current namespace.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api update namespace $APP_NS -n $CLUSTER_NS -f -
 name: $APP_NS
 namespace: $CLUSTER_NS
 tagPrefixes: ["app="]
 EOF
----

. Set a `WEBSERVER_TAG` environment variable containing the Microsegmentation tag you wish to use to identify it.
In our Hipster Shop example, the `frontend` pod has a Kubernetes label `app=frontend`.
+
[,console]
----
 export WEBSERVER_TAG=app=frontend
----

. If you're running the Hipster Shop, use the following command to extract the ports from the service definition (requires https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[jq]).
+
[,console]
----
 export TARGET_PORT=$(kubectl -n hipster-shop get service frontend-external -o json | jq '.spec.ports | .[].targetPort')
 echo $TARGET_PORT
 export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl -n hipster-shop get service frontend-external -o json | jq '.spec.ports | .[].nodePort')
 echo $NODE_PORT
 export PORT=$(kubectl -n hipster-shop get service frontend-external -o json | jq '.spec.ports | .[].port')
 echo $PORT
----

. Create a network ruleset allowing connections to the `frontend` pod.
[NOTE]
====
If you're not running the Hipster Shop, you may need to add your port numbers manually under `ports`.
You can view the ports in the service definition using `kubectl get service <service-name> -o yaml`.
Ensure that you add *all* of the ports under `ports` to the network ruleset.
====
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkrulesetpolicy -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: allow-web-server
 subject:
 - - $WEBSERVER_TAG
   - \$identity=processingunit
 incomingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - externalnetwork:name=internet
   protocolPorts:
   - "tcp/$NODE_PORT"
   - "tcp/$TARGET_PORT"
   - "tcp/$PORT"
 EOF
----

. Visit the website again, either by refreshing your existing browser connection or initiating a new one.
. You should see a new `internet` external network with a solid green line to the `frontend` pod.
[TIP]
====
You may need to exercise the application, wait a little while, and shorten the time window to see the solid green lines.
====
 image:/img/screenshots/net-ruleset-k8s-webserver-allowed.gif[Web server ok]

=== Allow kubelet communications

If the application uses health checks and liveness/readiness probes, you may see dashed green lines to your pods from *Somewhere*.
Clicking for more details, you may see that they have a cluster IP, but you cannot locate any pod, endpoint, service, or node with this IP.
It may be the bridge IP address of your kubelet.

. Use the following command to create an external network to represent your kubelets.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: kubelet
 entries:
 $(kubectl get node -o wide --no-headers | awk '{print "- "$6}')
 associatedTags:
 - externalnetwork:name=kubelet
 EOF
----

. Create a network ruleset to allow all of your pods to communicate with any of the kubelets in your cluster.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkrulesetpolicy -n $APP_NS -f -
 name: allow-kubelets
 subject:
 - - \$identity=processingunit
   - \$namespace=$APP_NS
 incomingRules:
 - action: Allow
   object:
   - - externalnetwork:name=kubelet
   protocolPorts:
   - tcp/1:65535
   - icmp/8/0
   - icmp/0/0
   - icmp/11/0
   - icmp/3/4
 EOF
----

. After some time, depending on the frequency of the probes, you should see a new `kubelet` external network with solid green line to the pods with health checks or liveness/readiness probes.
[TIP]
====
You may need to shorten the time window to see the solid green lines.
====
 image:/img/screenshots/net-ruleset-k8s-kubelet-allowed.gif[kubelet ok]

=== Disable discovery mode

. In the {{% console-web-interface %}}, select {{% platform-app-dep-map %}}, and review any dashed green flows.
As soon as you disable discovery mode, these connections will be blocked.
Take a few moments to allow any desired traffic before continuing to the next step.
. Issue the following command to disable discovery mode.
+
[,console]
----
 cat <<EOF | apoctl api update namespace $APP_NS -n $CLUSTER_NS -f -
 name: $APP_NS
 namespace: $CLUSTER_NS
 defaultPUIncomingTrafficAction: Reject
 defaultPUOutgoingTrafficAction: Reject
 EOF
----

. You may see a new external network named *Somewhere* with red flows or red flows between pods.
If you click on the red lines you can see that the connections were denied due to Microsegmentation's default *Reject all* ruleset.
+
Congratulations!
 You have secured your Kubernetes namespace.
 Microsegmentation denies any traffic not explicitly allowed by a network ruleset.
