=== Implementing the feature

==== Step one

Configure an identity provider.
We support OpenID Connect (OIDC), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers.
For more information about integrating with an OIDC identity provider, refer to xref:../../setup/idp/idp.adoc[Integrating with OIDC identity providers] and xref:../../setup/idp/ssh-ctrl-plane.adoc[For SSH and control plane users].

==== Step two

Complete xref:setup.adoc[Setting up SSH controls] as described in the next section.

==== Step three

Once you have completed the setup, your users can start logging into remote hosts with Aporeto's SSH certificates.

=== How it works

After authenticating to their identity provider, users obtain an Aporeto token.
They can then exchange their Aporeto token for an SSH certificate, as shown below.

Users can execute a single `apoctl` command to accomplish all the steps in the diagram or perform each step manually.

[NOTE]
====
Observe that the user has an Aporeto token at the beginning of the sequence shown above.
The sequence for obtaining an Aporeto token varies by identity provider.
Refer to xref:../../setup/idp/ssh-ctrl-plane.adoc[OIDC for SSH and Aporeto control plane users] to learn more about the OIDC sequence.
