=== About scaling the control plane

Scaling of the control plane can be done at two levels:

* pod auto scaling: when enabled, pod auto scaling will define `hpa` resources to scale the number of replicas depending on certain metrics.

[NOTE]
====
Your Kubernetes cluster needs to have a `metrics-server` installed.

To enable auto scaling you must meet the xref:../start/control-plane/large-deployments/requirements.adoc[nodes requirements].

====

* node auto scaling: depending on your Kubernetes provider, you may enable node auto scaling.

=== Maintenance mode

==== About maintenance mode

For certain operations like scaling, you may want to put the control plane in maintenance mode.
In this mode, the control plane ceases to serve the xref:../develop/ctrl-plane-api/ctrl-plane-api.adoc[Control Plane API] and provides the following output:

* From xref:../reference/cli.adoc[apoctl] command line client:

[,console]
----
apoctl api list namespaces
error: Cannot communicate: The api has been locked down by the server.
----

* From regular call to the xref:../develop/ctrl-plane-api//ctrl-plane-api.adoc[Control Plane API]:

[,json,subs="+attributes"]
----
curl -k https://{ctrl-plane-api-url}
[{"title":"Service Locked","description":"The requested service is in maintenance. Please try again in a moment.","code":423,"subject":"wutai"}]%
----

* From the https://microsegmentation.acme.com/app[Aporeto web interface]:

[NOTE]
====
The web interface will keep trying to reach the Control Plane API.
====

==== Enable maintenance mode

From within a xref:../start/control-plane/large-deployments/deploy.adoc#activate[activated voila environment], run the `maintenance` command:

[,console]
----
# the maintenance command
maintenance
----

This will provide the following output:

[,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
!!! You will put the control plane in maintenance mode. Service API \https://{ctrl-plane-api-url} will be interrupted until this script ends. !!!
----

[,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
Give a reason for maintenance (mandatory and will be logged): Test
Service API https://{ctrl-plane-api-url} in maintenance mode (reason: Test).
Redirecting API service to maintenance page... (please wait) Ok

#############################

= MAINTENANCE MODE ENABLED

= SERVICE IS SUSPENDED

#############################

Relaunch maintenance tool to stop the maintenance mode.

----

At this point the control plane is in maintenance mode.

Once you are done just run the `maintenance` command again:

----
Your platform is currently in maintenance mode
Do you want to restore the service (y/n): y
Service restored, maintenance took 1min.
----

And the service will be restored.
