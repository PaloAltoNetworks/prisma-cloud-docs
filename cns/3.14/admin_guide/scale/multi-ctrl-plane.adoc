=== About adding control planes
 
To scale horizontally, you can deploy more than one control plane and configure the control planes to trust each other.
In this section, we guide you through the process using two example control planes.

* Control plane A, managed by Annette, with the address `104.196.244.75.xip.io`
* Control plane B, managed by Bob, with the address `34.82.153.238.xip.io`

Annette and Bob both work for Acme, Inc.
Both control planes use `acme` as the account name and `/acme` as their root namespace.

=== Prerequisites

* At least two control planes (we'll refer to these as control plane A and control plane B)
* At least one enforcer on each control plane (we'll refer to these as enforcer A and enforcer B)
* Firewalls must allow pass-through communications and not modify any packets

[.task]
=== Set up test images

[.procedure]
. Access the enforcer A host, such as via SSH.

. Use the following command to spin up an nginx web server listening on any IP address over port 80.

  sudo docker run --rm -d -p 80:80 nginx

. Open the web interface of control plane A and confirm that the web server shows up as a processing unit.

. Access the enforcer B host, such as via SSH.

. Use the following command to spin up a `centos` image.

  sudo docker run -it centos

. Attempt to curl the nginx web server in control plane A, using `http` and the public IP address of the enforcer A host.

  curl http://54.65.32.1
+
It should time out after a while.
+
  curl: (7) Failed to connect to 54.65.32.1 port 80: Connection timed out

. Open the web interface of control plane B and select **Platform**.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `centos` image, but no record of the request.

. Open the web interface of control plane A and select **Platform**.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `nginx` image.
When you click on it, you should see the record of the request under the **Access** tab, denied due to `token (The token was invalid.)`.

+
TIP: Observe the `$controller` tags in the metadata of the `nginx` and `centos` images.
These identify the control plane that they belong to.
We'll use these later on to enable communications between the control planes.

[.task]
=== Configuring control planes to trust each other

[.procedure]
. Copy the certificate of control plane A: open the **Account** page in the web interface, scroll down to the **Namespace Certificate Authority** section, and click **Copy to clipboard**.
+
image::fed-cp-copy-cert.gif[width=700]

. Paste the certificate into a file and save it with a PEM extension.

. Configure control plane B to trust the certificate of control plane A: open the web interface of control plane B, make sure you're in the root namespace, expand **Namespace Settings**, select **Trusted Namespace**, click **Create**, drag the certificate of the first control plane into the **Certificate Authority** field, name the trusted namespace, and click **Create**.
+

. Repeat these steps in reverse, copying the certificate of control plane B and adding it to control plane A as trusted. In the following example, we copy Bob's certificate, open Annette's control plane, and trust Bob's certificate.

[.task]
=== Verifying the trusted relationship

[.procedure]
. Access the enforcer B host again.

. If necessary launch a new `centos` image.

  sudo docker run -it centos

. From inside the `centos` container, attempt again to curl the nginx web server in control plane A.

  curl http://54.65.32.1
+
It should time out again.
+
  curl: (7) Failed to connect to 54.65.32.1 port 80: Connection timed out

. Open the web interface of control plane B and select **Platform**.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `centos` image, but still no record of the request.

. Open the web interface of control plane A and select **Platform**.
+
You should now see a failed flow from control plane B to the `nginx` image.
Clicking for more details, you see that the reason for the denial was Aporeto's default deny policy.<br>
+

+
Your control planes now recognize and trust each other, but processing units in one cannot communicate with processing units in the other.
You must create network policies to allow this traffic.

[.task]
=== Allowing the control planes to communicate

In the following exercise, we create network policies in both control planes to allow our `centos` image to communicate with the `nginx` image.

[.procedure]
. In the web interface of control plane A, expand **Network authorization**, select **Network policies**, and click the **Create** button.

. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow nginx in A to communicate with centos in B` and click **Next**.

. In the **Source** pane, type the controller tag of control plane B and press ENTER.
+
In our example, this has the tag `$controller=34.82.153.238.xip.io`.
Then type `$image=centos` and press ENTER.
Confirm that the two tags are connected by an `and`.

. Click **Next**.

. In the **Destination** pane, type the controller tag of control plane A and press ENTER.
+
In our example, the tag is `$controller=104.196.244.75.xip.io`.
Then type `$image=nginx` and press ENTER.
Confirm that the two tags are connected by an `and`.

. Click **Next**, then click **Create**.

. Open the web interface of control plane B, expand **Network authorization**, select **Network policies**, and click the **Create** button.

. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow nginx in A to communicate with centos in B` and click **Next**.

. In the **Source** pane, type the controller tag of control plane B and press ENTER.
+
In our example, this has the tag `$controller=34.82.153.238.xip.io`.
Then type `$image=centos` and press ENTER.
Confirm that the two tags are connected by an `and`.

. Click **Next**.

. In the **Destination** pane, type the controller tag of control plane A and press ENTER.
+
In our example, the tag is `$controller=104.196.244.75.xip.io`.
Then type `$image=nginx` and press ENTER.
Confirm that the two tags are connected by an `and`.

. Click **Next**, then click **Create**.

[.task]
=== Verifying the communications

[.procedure]
. Access the enforcer B host again.

. If necessary launch a new `centos` image.

  sudo docker run -it centos

. From inside the `centos` container, attempt again to curl the nginx web server in control plane A.

  curl http://54.65.32.1
+
It should return the nginx welcome page.

. Open the web interface of control plane B and select **Platform**.
+
You should see the processing unit representing the `centos` image, but still no record of the request.

. Open the web interface of control plane A and select **Platform**.
+
You should now see an allowed flow from control plane B to the `nginx` image.
Clicking for more details, you see that the policy you created was applied.
