=== About allowing access to web servers

Because Aporeto denies layer 3 and 4 traffic by default, after you install an Aporeto enforcer on the host of a web server, the web server begins to reject all incoming connections.
Users attempting to access the web server receive time out messages.

The view from the *Platform* pane of the Aporeto web interface looks something like this.

When you click on the red line and select the *Policies* tab, you will see that the traffic is denied due to the *Aporeto default reject all* policy.

This section describes how to allow incoming layer 3 and 4 traffic to web servers.

=== Prerequisites

* xref:../../start/apoctl/apoctl.adoc[`apoctl` installed]
* An `APOCTL_NAMESPACE` environment variable set to the namespace of the web server's processing unit
* Authenticated to `apoctl` with either of the following roles:
** *Namespace Administrator*
** *Network Editor*

=== Creating an external network

The following command creates an external network representing TCP connections on port 80 and 443 from any IP address.
It names the external network `internet` and assigns it a tag of `ext:name=internet`.

[,console]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -f -
name: internet
entries:
- 0.0.0.0/0
protocols:
- tcp
ports:
- "80"
- "443"
associatedTags:
- ext:name=internet
EOF
----

You may need to modify the `ports` values to match those that your web server listens on.
If there is a load balancer or a Kubernetes service fronting the web server, specify its port.

[TIP]
====
If you're not sure, go ahead and create the external network using the above definition. You can edit it later.
====

=== Selecting the web server

Identify a tag or set of tags that allow you to uniquely identify the web server or group of web servers.
It may help to open up the Aporeto web interface and review the tags of the processing units that represent the web servers.

Aporeto supports logical tag expressions, allowing you to link tags with ANDs and ORs.
You may be able to come up with a tag expression that selects the web servers using the tags that they already have.
Alternatively, you may want to add tags to the web servers to make it easier to select them.

Once you have determined the tag or tags, set an environment variable to contain each tag.
We add four below.

[,console]
----
export WEBSERVER="pu:type=web-server"
export PROD="pu:state=prod"
export DEV="pu:state=dev"
export PU="\$identity=processingunit"
----

[WARNING]
====
Because these values are stored as environment variables, you must escape any bash control characters. In the example above, we escape the `$` bash control character by adding `\` in front of it.
====

=== Creating a network policy to accept connections

Next, use one of the following commands to create a network policy that accepts incoming requests from the external network you just defined.
We provide three examples below to show how to work with a single tag as well as multiple tags with both AND and OR relationships.

Single tag:

----
    cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy -f -
    name: allow-web-server
    action: Allow
    applyPolicyMode: IncomingTraffic
    propagate: true
    logsEnabled: true
    subject:
    - - ext:name=internet
    object:
    - - "$WEBSERVER"
    EOF
----

Tags with AND relationship:

----
    cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy -f -
    name: allow-web-server
    action: Allow
    applyPolicyMode: IncomingTraffic
    propagate: true
    logsEnabled: true
    subject:
    - - ext:name=internet
    object:
    - - "$WEBSERVER"
      - "$PU"
    EOF
----

Tags with OR relationship:

----
    cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy -f -
    name: allow-web-server
    action: Allow
    applyPolicyMode: IncomingTraffic
    propagate: true
    logsEnabled: true
    subject:
    - - ext:name=internet
    object:
    - - "$WEBSERVER"
      - "$PU"
      - "$PROD"
    - - "$WEBSERVER"
      - "$PU"
      - "$DEV"
    EOF
----

Observe how the hyphens allow you to specify AND and OR relationships between the tags.

=== Verifying that the web server accepts incoming connections

Open a browser and paste in the IP address or domain name of your web server.
In the Aporeto web interface, you should see a green flow as shown below.

image::net-pol-web-server-allow.png[web-server-allowing-incoming-requests]

If your request instead times out and you don't see the *internet* external network with a green flow, adjust your external network and network policy definitions as needed.

=== Next steps

If your web server is public, you are done!

If you want to allow only certain people to access the web server, you can configure Aporeto to authenticate your users against an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.
Review xref:../../setup/idp/idp.adoc[Integrating with OIDC identity providers], and then complete the steps in xref:../../setup/idp/app.adoc[For Aporeto-protected applications].
