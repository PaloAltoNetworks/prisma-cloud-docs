+
image::host-mode-enabled-3.14.gif[Host protection enabled]
+
This example shows an EC2 instance that uses both IPv4 and IPv6 with ICMP traffic allowed.
We can see our incoming SSH connection, an outgoing TCP request to the AWS metadata server, the ping request we just made, and a couple of common UDP requests.
+
Congratulations!
You've enabled host mode in a very permissive initial configuration.
The host should continue to function as it was before, with no impact to its accustomed communications or applications.
+
We recommend allowing your protected host to run in this initial, permissive configuration for some time, perhaps a week.
During this interval, the IP addresses, protocols, and ports of the allowed communications collect in Aporeto.
You can use this information to compose a comprehensive list of the minimum allowed communications, ensuring a seamless experience when you disable the `Allow all incoming TCP/UDP traffic` policy and the `Allow all outgoing TCP/UDP traffic` policy.
+
When you're ready to set more restrictive policies, continue to <<_hardening-host-protection,Hardening host protection>>.

[#_hardening-host-protection]
=== Hardening host protection

==== Overview

After <<_enabling-host-protection,enabling host protection>> and waiting for some time to allow information about the host's communications to populate in Aporeto, follow the procedures in this section to harden your host.

The section begins by describing how to allow some of the most common and critical traffic.
After completing these procedures, you should be familiar with the process and capable of allowing additional traffic on your own, according to the specificities of your circumstances.

While the port numbers used in the following procedures should match up with yours, there is a small chance that they will not.
You may need to modify the port numbers if the host deviates from well-known defaults.

[.task]
==== Review the flows

Before you begin, review your host's communication patterns.

[.procedure]
. From the https://microsegmentation.acme.com/app/[*App* page of the Aporeto web interface], select the *Platform* view.
. Click the green flows from the host to *TCP all ports* and *UDP all ports*.
. Select the *Access* tab.
. Scroll through the list of connections, paying particular attention to the ports.
. Try filtering the list by clicking the search icon, selecting *Port*, and typing a number like 53  or 123.

[.task]
==== Allow network time protocol communications

[NOTE]
====
Aporeto requires accurate time-keeping.
If you have not already configured the host to synchronize times with authoritative sources, take a few moments to do so now.
====

Complete the following steps to allow network time protocol (NTP) traffic from the host to UDP port 123.

[.procedure]
. Under *Network authorization*, select *External networks*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type `NTP` in the *Name* field and click *Next*.
. If you're using IPv4 addresses, type `0.0.0.0/0` in the *Excluded Networks* field and press ENTER.
. If you're using IPv6 addresses, type `::/0` in the *Excluded Networks* field and press ENTER.
. Type `udp` in the *Protocols* field and press ENTER.
. Type `123` in the *Target Ports* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=ntp` in the *Tags* field and click *Create*.
. Remaining under *Network authorization*, select *Network policies*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow outgoing NTP traffic` in the *Name* field.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `hs:name=host` in the *Source* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=ntp` in the *Target* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*, then click *Create*.
. In *Network policies*, click the *Create* button.
. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow incoming NTP traffic` in the *Name* field.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=ntp` in the *Source* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `hs:name=host` in the *Target* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*, then click *Create*.
. Select *Platform*.
. After some time, you should see a new external network named *NTP* with a green flow from your host, as shown below.
+
[TIP]
====
To see the results immediately, you can restart the NTP service.
====
+
image::host-udp-123-ntp-3.14.gif[NTP traffic allowed]
+
This example shows a dual-stack EC2 instance, using both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
You should observe UDP port 123 flows from the host to the *UDP all ports* external network, as well as to the *NTP* external network.
Compare the time stamps.
The flows to the *UDP port 123* external network are newer.
The *NTP* external network will contain all of the flows to UDP port 123 from now on.

[.task]
==== Allow dynamic host configuration protocol communications

If your host uses dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), you must enable it by opening UDP ports 67-68 (IPv4) and/or ports 546-547 (IPv6).

[WARNING]
====
Failure to allow communications between the host and the DHCP server can result in a total lack of access to the host. If the host is using DHCP, ensure that you allow this traffic to prevent yourself from getting locked out. If you're not sure, after allowing the host to run in permissive mode for some time, click the *UDP all ports* flow, select the *Access* tab, click the search icon, select *Port*, and type `67`, `68`, `546`, or `547` as a filter.
====

[.procedure]
. Under *Network authorization*, select *External networks*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type `DHCP` in the *Name* field and click *Next*.
. If you're using IPv4 addresses, type `0.0.0.0/0` in the *Excluded Networks* field and press ENTER.
. If you're using IPv6 addresses, type `::/0` in the *Excluded Networks* field and press ENTER.
. Type `udp` in the *Protocols* field and press ENTER.
. If you're using IPv4 addresses, type `67` in the *Target Ports* field, press ENTER, then type `68` and press ENTER.
. If you're using IPv6 addresses, type `546` in the *Target Ports* field, press ENTER, then type `547` and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=dhcp` in the *Tags* field and click *Create*.
. Under *Network authorization*, select *Network policies*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow outgoing DHCP traffic` in the *Name* field.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `hs:name=host` in the *Source* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=dhcp` in the *Target* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*, then click *Create*.
. In *Network policies*, click the *Create* button.
. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow incoming DHCP traffic` in the *Name* field.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=dhcp` in the *Source* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `hs:name=host` in the *Target* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*, then click *Create*.
. Select *Platform*.
. After some time, perhaps as long as thirty minutes, you should see a new external network named *DHCP* with a green flow from your host, as shown below.
+
[TIP]
====
To see results immediately, you can close and reopen your SSH session.
====
+
image::host-udp-67-dhcp-3.14.gif[DHCP traffic allowed]
+
In this example, we show a dual-stack EC2 instance, using both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
You should observe UDP ports 67-68 / 546-7 flows from the host to the *UDP all ports* external network, as well as to the the *DHCP* external network.
Compare the time stamps.
The flows to the *DHCP* external network are newer.
The *DHCP* external network will contain all of the DHCP flows from now on.

[.task]
==== Allow domain name system communications

Aporeto requires domain name system (DNS) resolution.
If you do not allow DNS, the enforcers won't be able to connect to the control plane.
Complete the following steps to allow connections to UDP port 53.

[TIP]
====
We assume in this procedure that your DNS servers use IPv4 addresses.
If not, please refer to the previous procedures for general guidance on IPv6 addresses.
====

[.procedure]
. Under *Network Authorizations*, select *External Networks*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type `DNS` in the *Name* field and click *Next*.
. Type `0.0.0.0/0` in the *Networks* field and press ENTER.
. Type `udp` in the *Protocols* field and press ENTER.
. Type `53` in the *Target Ports* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=dns` in the *Tags* field and click *Create*.
. Under *Network authorization*, select *Network policies*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow outgoing DNS traffic` in the *Name* field.
. Select *Outgoing traffic* from the *Policy Mode* list box.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `hs:name=host` in the *Source* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=dns` in the *Target* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*, then click *Create*.
. Select *Platform*.
. After some time, you should see a new external network named *DNS* with a green flow from your host, as shown below.
+
image::host-udp-53-dns-3.14.gif[DNS traffic allowed]
+
You should observe UDP port 53 flows from the host to the *UDP all ports* external network, as well as to the the *DNS* external network.
Compare the time stamps.
The flows to the *DNS* external network are newer.
The *DNS* external network will contain all of the flows to UDP port 53 from now on.

[.task]
==== Allow lightweight directory access protocol communications

If the host needs to connect to an lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server, you must enable TCP communications, typically over port 389.
We assume in this procedure that your LDAP servers use IPv4 addresses.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using LDAPS, open ports 636, 3268, and 3269 instead of port 389.
====

[.procedure]
. Under *Network Authorizations*, select *External Networks*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type `LDAP` in the *Name* field and click *Next*.
. Type `0.0.0.0/0` in the *Networks* field and press ENTER.
. Type `tcp` in the *Protocols* field and press ENTER.
. Type `389` in the *Target Ports* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=ldap` in the *Tags* field and click *Create*.
. Under *Network authorization*, select *Network policies*, and click the *Create* button.
. Type a descriptive name such as `Allow outgoing LDAP traffic` in the *Name* field.
. Select *Outgoing traffic* from the *Network policy mode* list box.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `hs:name=host` in the *Source* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*.
. Type `ext:name=ldap` in the *Target* field and press ENTER.
. Click *Next*, then click *Create*.
. From within the host, manually trigger a connection to the LDAP server.
. Returning to the Aporeto web interface, select *Platform*.
. You should see a new external network named *LDAP* with a green flow from your host, as shown below.
+
image::host-tcp-389-ldap-3.14.gif[LDAP traffic allowed]
+
You should observe TCP port 389 flows from the host to the *TCP all ports* external network, as well as to the the *LDAP* external network.
Compare the time stamps.
The flows to the *LDAP* external network are newer.
The *LDAP* external network will contain all of the flows to TCP port 389 from now on.

==== Allow additional communications

After completing the procedures above, you should observe a much shorter list of flows from your host to both the *TCP all ports* external network and the *UDP all ports* external network.
Next, you must decide which of the remaining flows you want to allow and which you want to deny.
Create external networks and policies for the protocol and port(s) you want to allow, as in the previous procedures.
You can also further harden your security by limiting the requests and responses to specific IP addresses.

To assist you, a list of common additional traffic follows, along with hyperlinks to their common ports.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) provides a https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml[searchable Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry] that may be useful as you complete your list of allowed traffic.

[.task]
==== Disable allow all TCP/UDP policy

Once you have allowed all of the traffic that you want to allow, complete the following steps to disable the `Allow all outgoing TCP/UDP traffic` and `Allow all incoming TCP/UDP traffic` policies.

[.procedure]
. Expand *Network Authorizations* and select *Policies*.
. Locate the *Allow all outgoing TCP/UDP traffic* and click the *Disable* button.
. Locate the *Allow all incoming TCP/UDP traffic* and click the *Disable* button.
. Select *Platform* and check for any red flows. Confirm that you intended to deny any red flows that may be shown or else allow the denied traffic.
