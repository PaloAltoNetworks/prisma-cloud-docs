=== About designing a namespace scheme

Namespaces define logical groups of resources.
You should group your resources according to their users, which may be inside or outside of your organization.
An optimal namespace scheme will make it easier to provide a good user experience and control access.
Some goals, recommendations, and considerations follow.

* *Operator namespaces*--namespaces have hierarchical relationships, like folders in a file system.
You can propagate objects from parent to child, but never from child to child or child to parent.
The users responsible for administering the system, called operators, should have namespaces near the top of the hierarchy.
This allows the operators to propagate objects to the child namespaces.
Propagation reduces manual work effort and allows the operators to ensure that the children conform to basic security requirements.
* *Security zones*--grouping resources according to their level of exposure to users outside your organization helps you control access with network policies.
Let's consider a common example: separating the development from the production environment.
Only developers can access the development environment, allowing them to innovate in a safe space.
Once the code is stabilized and tested, it's pushed to production.
Only production is available to the public.
* *Multi-tenancy*--creating a namespace per team or project provides better usability.
Users can log into Aporeto and view just the resources that pertain to them.
It also protects users from each other, prevents unauthorized modifications, and allows you to follow the https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege[principle of least privilege].

=== Simple namespace scheme

The following diagram illustrates a simple namespace scheme that isolates developers from operators and the development environment from the production environment.

In this scheme, only the operator can access the root namespace `/acme`.
The operator sets policy in `/acme` and propagates it down to the children: `/acme/dev` and `/acme/prod`.
Developers can view the propagated policy in `/acme/dev` but cannot modify it.
The policy ensures that:

* Apps under development cannot access the production database.
* Only the production web server accepts requests from the public internet.

The simple namespace scheme could be appropriate for a proof-of-concept or a very small organization.
The root namespace `/acme` has only one set of credentials.
As soon as you have more than one operator, you should move to the multi-tenant scheme discussed in the next section.

=== Multi-tenant namespace scheme

Creating a namespace per project or team provides better usability and hardens the security posture of medium to large organizations.
The following diagram illustrates an example multi-tenant scheme, achieved by adding `/acme/team-a` and `/acme/team-b` namespaces to the simple namespace scheme.

Each operator uses their own set of credentials to log in and no longer need to access the root `/acme` namespace.

In a Kubernetes/OpenShift context, the `/acme/team-a/dev`, `/acme/team-a/prod`, `/acme/team-b/prod`, and `/acme/team-b/dev` namespaces represent clusters.
They will have as children the Kubernetes/OpenShift namespaces, mapped and synchronized by Aporeto.
Refer to the xref:../reference/components/operator.adoc#_mapnamespaces[Aporeto operator reference page] to learn more about the mapping.
