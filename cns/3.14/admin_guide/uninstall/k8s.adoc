=== About uninstalling the operator

As of 3.11 the Aporeto operator uses finalizers on all custom resource objects.
To perform a clean and complete removal of Aporeto from your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, please follow our instructions.

=== Prerequisites

We assume the following:

* the base namespace is `aporeto`
* the enforcer has been installed into the `aporeto` namespace
* the Aporeto operator has been installed into the `aporeto-operator` namespace
* the Helm releases for the Aporeto CRDs, the operator and the enforcer are called `aporeto-crds`, `aporeto-operator` and `enforcerd` respectively

=== 1. Uninstall the enforcer

Use Helm to uninstall the Aporeto enforcer.

[,console]
----
helm delete enforcerd -n aporeto
----

It should return the following.

----
release "enforcerd" deleted
----

[#_2-disable-the-core-controllers]
=== 2. Disable the core controllers

Add an annotation to the `aporeto` namespace to disable the Aporeto core controllers.

Kubernetes:

----
kubectl annotate namespace aporeto aporeto.io/disable-aporeto-ctrls="true"
----

OpenShift:

----
oc annotate namespace aporeto aporeto.io/disable-aporeto-ctrls="true"
----

It should return the following.

----
namespace/aporeto annotated
----

Use the following command to view the last thirty lines of the Aporeto operator's logs.

Kubernetes:

----
kubectl logs -n aporeto-operator --tail=30 -l app=aporeto-operator
----

OpenShift:

----
oc logs -n aporeto-operator --tail=30 -l app=aporeto-operator
----

Verify that the core controllers have been disabled by looking for lines like the following.

----
{"level":"info","ts":1566241077.0337272,"logger":"WatchNamespacesMapper","msg":"Ignoring operator namespace and base namespace","name":"aporeto"}
{"level":"info","ts":1566241077.0340881,"logger":"WatchNamespacesMapper","msg":"Disable API-aporeto Annotations found"}
{"level":"info","ts":1566241077.034167,"logger":"WatchNamespacesMapper","msg":"No Further reconcile as the Disable API-aporeto ctrls Initiated","name":"aporeto"}
----

=== 3. Delete control plane CRDs

Use the following command to remove all Aporeto CRDs in the `api.aporeto.io` group.

Kubernetes:

----
    for crd in $(kubectl api-resources --api-group=api.aporeto.io -o name); \
    do kubectl delete $crd --all --all-namespaces; done
----

OpenShift:

----
    for ns in aporeto aporeto-operator; do
      for crd in $(oc api-resources --api-group=api.aporeto.io -o name); do
        oc delete $crd --all --namespace $ns;
      done
    done
----

[WARNING]
====
Requires `kubectl` version 1.14 or later.
====

It should return something like the following.

----
No resources found
No resources found
namespacemappingpolicy.api.aporeto.io "default-d2hzd" deleted
namespacemappingpolicy.api.aporeto.io "kube-public-fl6hc" deleted
namespacemappingpolicy.api.aporeto.io "kube-system-9wrj5" deleted
namespace.api.aporeto.io "default-j88dl" deleted
namespace.api.aporeto.io "kube-public-t9bnv" deleted
namespace.api.aporeto.io "kube-system-h69gl" deleted
No resources found
No resources found

No resources found
----

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that all of the `api.aporeto.io` CRDs have been removed before proceeding to the next step.
====

=== 4. Uninstall the operator

Use Helm to uninstall the Aporeto operator.

[,console]
----
helm delete aporeto-operator -n aporeto-operator
----

It should return the following.

----
release "aporeto-operator" deleted
----

=== 5. Delete namespaces

Delete the `aporeto` and `aporeto-operator` namespaces with `kubectl`.

Kubernetes:
----
kubectl delete namespaces aporeto aporeto-operator
----

OpenShift:

----
oc delete namespaces aporeto aporeto-operator
----

It should return the following.

----
namespace "aporeto" deleted
namespace "aporeto-operator" deleted
----

[TIP]
====
Ensure that the namespaces have really been deleted and are not stuck in the `Terminating` state.
If your namespaces are stuck in the `Terminating` state, most likely some `api.aporeto.io` CRDs didn't get deleted.
To resolve the issue, reinstall the Aporeto operator and start the uninstall procedure again at <<_2-disable-the-core-controllers,step 2>>.
Because the `api.aporeto.io` CRDs have finalizers, you need the operator to delete them.
====

=== 6. Delete integration CRDs

Use Helm to delete the `k8s.aporeto.io` CRDs.

[,console]
----
helm delete aporeto-crds
----

It should return the following.

----
release "aporeto-crds" deleted
----
