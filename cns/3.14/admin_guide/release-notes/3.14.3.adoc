=== What's new

==== Support for multiple control planes

You can now scale horizontally by adding control planes.
To learn more, refer to xref:../scale/multi-ctrl-plane.adoc[Adding control planes].

==== Simpler syntax for excluding subnets

A new NOT (`!`) operator simplifies the syntax for defining subnets to ignore.
Let's imagine we wanted to exclude 10.0.0.0/8 and 11.0.0.0/8.
We can accomplish this in the *Networking* pane of an enforcer profile, using any of the following fields: *Managed TCP Networks*, *Managed UDP Networks*, or *Excluded Networks*.
Previously, we would have had to resort to the following binary expansion.

[,console]
----
0.0.0.0/5 {0.0.0.0/8 .. 7.0.0.0/8}
8.0.0.0/7 {8.0.0.0/8 .. 9.0.0.0/8}
12.0.0.0/6 {12.0.0.0/8 ..15.0.0.0/8}
16.0.0.0/4 {16.0.0.0/8 .. 31.0.0.0/8}
32.0.0.0/3 {32.0.0.0/8 .. 63.0.0.0/8}
64.0.0.0/2 {64.0.0.0/8 .. 127.0.0.0/8}
128.0.0.0/1 {128.0.0.0/8 .. 255.0.0.0/8}
----

Now we can use the new  NOT (`!`) operator for a much briefer and more readable expression.

[,console]
----
0.0.0.0/0 !10.0.0.0/8 !11.0.0.0/8
----

==== Ability to forward packets unmodified

Aporeto forwards packets as is, without making any modifications, for IP addresses:

* In *Excluded Networks*
* Excluded from the *Managed TCP Networks* or *Managed UDP Networks*

==== Easier enforcer deployment

`apoctl` offers a new `protect` command that makes it a lot easier to deploy the Aporeto enforcer to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster and Linux hosts.
Learn how to use `protect` in the xref:../start/enforcer/linux.adoc[Linux] and xref:../start/enforcer/linux.adoc[Kubernetes/OpenShift] installation sections.
We also recommend reviewing the xref:../reference/cli.adoc#_protect-command[`protect` reference documentation].

=== Resolved issues

* *#137*: Spurious duplicate enforcer alerts no longer occasionally appear after upgrading.

=== Known issues

* *#146*: RHEL 8 and RHEL CoreOS 8 (used by OpenShift 4) have deprecated `iptables` in favor of `nftables`.
Before installing Aporeto in these environments, you must enable `iptables`, such as via the following commands:
+
[,console]
----
modprobe ip_tables
modprobe iptable_nat
----

* *#1302*: RHEL 8+ requires special configuration to work with the SSH access control feature.
If you require this distribution, contact us for assistance.
