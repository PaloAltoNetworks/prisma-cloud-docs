=== What's new

==== Windows support

Aporeto now provides `apoctl` and enforcer binaries for Windows.
You can install the enforcer as a service on Windows Server 2016 and 2019 hosts.
Refer to xref:../start/start.adoc[Get started] for instructions.

==== Helm 3 support

This release adds support for Helm 3.

==== IPv6 support

Aporeto no longer ignores IPv6 communications.
You can now control and monitor IPv6 traffic.
To enable this, set the enforcer's `ENFORCERD_ENABLE_IPV6` option to `1`.
Refer to the xref:../start/enforcer/linux.adoc[installation documentation] for more information.

==== eBPF support

This release of Aporeto provides better performance by using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) on systems that support it.

=== Upgrade notes

The 3.14 enforcer requires changes to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/50719[immutable Kubernetes fields].
Before upgrading, issue the following command to remove the enforcer's Helm chart.

[,console]
----
helm delete enforcerd
----

=== Known issue

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8+ requires special configuration to work with the SSH access control feature.
