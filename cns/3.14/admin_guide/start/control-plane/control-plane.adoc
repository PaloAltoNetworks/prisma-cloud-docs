The control plane has two different types of installation that depends on your workloads and needs.

. *Large deployments*: using a Kubernetes cluster
. *Multi-region*: deploying the Aporeto control plane across multiple regions ensures that your core services stay up after your region goes down.

Before diving into each deployment type, let's have a look at the architecture overview.

==== Architecture overview

The control plane is a set of microservices and databases.

===== Microservices

Each microservice exposes a xref:../../develop/ctrl-plane-api/about.adoc[REST API] that are gathered
to a single endpoint by an API Gateway. This API endpoint can be consumed by any client like:

* the xref:../../concepts/key-concepts.adoc#_control-plane[web interface]
* the xref:../../concepts/key-concepts.adoc#_enforcer[enforcers]
* xref:../../concepts/key-concepts.adoc#_control-plane[apoctl] command line

===== Databases

Databases are used to store different kinds of data:

* _MongoDB_: a document oriented database used to store object like policies, namespaces and enforcers
* _InfluxDB_: a time series oriented database used to store reports like flows, DNS lookup and event logs
* _Redis_: a key-value store used for caching

===== User interface

The web user interface is a client consuming the xref:../../develop/ctrl-plane-api/about.adoc[REST API]
exposed by the control plane.

The web interface is loaded and runs in your web browser.
