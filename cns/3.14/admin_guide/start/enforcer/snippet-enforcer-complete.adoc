Open the Aporeto web interface at {ctrl-plane-ui-url}/app, switch to the mapped namespace, and select *Enforcers*.
You should find your enforcer listed with a status of *connected*.
Click the enforcer and review its metadata.

Congratulations!
Aporeto now recognizes the containers on the host as processing units, allowing you to control and monitor their traffic.
If you have containers running on the host, select *Platform* in the Aporeto web interface.
The containers and their traffic should appear.
