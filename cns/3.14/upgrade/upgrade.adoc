Upgrade your Aporeto deployment.

Always conduct upgrades in sequence: first the control plane, then all `apoctl` clients, then the enforcers (optional).

After upgrading the control plane, you should upgrade all <code>apoctl</code> clients.
Otherwise, you may experience unexpected behavior.
The upgrade of <code>apoctl</code> consists of a simple xref:../start/apoctl.adoc[reinstall].

Never upgrade the enforcers without first upgrading the control plane.
Newer enforcers cannot communicate with older control planes.
Upgrading the enforcers is optional as older enforcers can continue to communicate with newer control planes.
