=== Resolved issues

* *CNS-235*: Proxies configured for Prometheus now get applied to Alertmanager, allowing you to forward alerts through HTTPS proxies.
* *CNS-276*: Rare circumstances no longer cause a race condition that prevents the enforcer from obtaining the latest network policies from the control plane after a restart.
* *CNS-323*: We now provide more details at the debug log level to make it easier to troubleshoot `422` errors from the `/flowreports` endpoint.
Increase the logging level of the reporting service to find out the IP address of the enforcer host, its namespace, the claims in its token, and more.
* *CNS-457*: Enabling discovery mode no longer fails with the error `Attribute 'servicePorts' is required`.
* *CNS-496*: The Aporeto control plane can now connect to external MongoDB instances with custom certificate authorities.

=== Known issues

* *APO-146*: RHEL 8 and RHEL CoreOS 8 (used by OpenShift 4) have deprecated `iptables` in favor of `nftables`.
Before installing Aporeto in these environments, you must enable `iptables`, such as via the following commands:
+
[,console]
----
modprobe ip_tables
modprobe iptable_nat
----

* *CNS-153*: When using relative time values with `apoctl`, the values must be in relation to Pacific Standard Time (PST).
For example, if you are in France and want to retrieve the last five minues of flow logs, you could use `-9h5m`.
Another workaround for this issue is to use absolute time values.
* *CNS-614*: The prebuilt CentOS 7.0 images distributed by OpenStack prefixed with `CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-2014` do not include the `xt_cgroups.ko` kernel module xref:../start/enforcer/reqs.adoc#kernel-modules[required by the enforcer].
* *CNS-121*: When multiple clients attempt to connect to the same HTTP service on a Windows host, some may experience timeouts.
* *CNS-126*: After decommissioning an enforcer, you may find some of its iptables rules still in place.

=== Deprecation notices

A future release will remove support for the following.
Please plan accordingly.

* *App integrations*: 4.0 will not include the Claire vulnerability scanner or any other app integrations.
* *CoreOS, Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL), and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6*: upgrade to CoreOS/OEL/RHEL 7 or later.
* *Custom resource definitions*: Aporeto won't create https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[custom resource definitions (CRDs)] in Kubernetes/OpenShift.
* *Enforcer as standalone container*: you must install the 4.0 enforcer as a Linux/Windows service or Kubernetes/OpenShift `DaemonSet`.
* *Enforcer audit logging capabilities*: due to a lack of adoption.
* *Host services*: migrate to external networks and network policies.
* *`kubenet` support*: migrate to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/[CNI plugins] if necessary.
For example, GKE clusters use `kubenet` by default.
* *xref:../start/control-plane/multi-region.adoc[Multi-region control planes]*: migrate to xref:../scale/multi-ctrl-plane.adoc[federated control planes].
* *Namespace editor and namespace auditor roles*: migrate users to equivalent roles.
For example, migrate users with the *Namespace editor* role to *Namespace administrator*.
* *xref:../secure/ssh.adoc[SSH controls]*: ignored by the 4.0 enforcer.
