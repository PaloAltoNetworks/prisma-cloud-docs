=== Breaking change

Aporeto nows uses the full URL as the value of the `$controller` tag, including the port if it deviates from the default.
We include several examples below to illustrate the difference.

|===
| Description | 3.14.3 tag | 3.14.4 tag

| FQDN with default port
| `$controller=acme.com`
| `+$controller=https://acme.com+`

| FQDN with non-default port
| `$controller=acme.com`
| `+$controller=https://acme.com:776+`

| IP with default port
| `$controller=56.78.94.100.com`
| `+$controller=https://56.78.94.100.com+`

| IP with non-default port
| `$controller=56.78.94.100.com`
| `+$controller=https://56.78.94.100.com:776+`

If you have configured multiple control planes for horizontal scale, you must upgrade in the following sequence.

. xref:../upgrade/control-plane.adoc[Upgrade your control plane].
. Within the Aporeto web interface, open the *Account* page and renew the certificate of your certificate authority.
If you experience a failure, see <<known-issues,known issue #249>>.
. xref:../upgrade/enforcer.adoc[Upgrade] or restart your enforcers.
. Confirm that the `$controller` tags of the processing units use the new format.
. Repeat the steps in xref:../scale/multi-ctrl-plane.adoc#configuring-control-planes-to-trust-each-other[Configuring control planes to trust each other] again.
. If you have network policies that use the `$controller` tag, update them to the new format.

=== Resolved issues

* *#188*: When host protection is enabled, the enforcer no longer allows traffic on port 65535 by default.
* *#193*: The *Compute suggestions* button in the *Suggest policies* panel of the *Platform* pane now returns policy suggestions if you have some flows.
* *#222*: When using a target network, creating a network policy that allows a protected host to accept inbound TCP connections on port 22 no longer occasionally causes the host to accept inbound connections on all ports.

=== Known issues

* *#146*: RHEL 8 and RHEL CoreOS 8 (used by OpenShift 4) have deprecated `iptables` in favor of `nftables`.
Before installing Aporeto in these environments, you must enable `iptables`, such as via the following commands:
+
[,console]
----
modprobe ip_tables
modprobe iptable_nat
----

* *#249*: Under certain circumstances, attempts to renew the Aporeto certificate authority's certificate may fail.
From the web interface, after clicking the *Renew Local CA* button, you observe that the value of the certificate shown above does not change.
Using `apoctl` you receive a `422` error with the message `Field LocalCA is read only`.
To work around this issue, open the Aporeto web interface and log in using your company account administrator credentials.
Click on the key icon in the bottom left corner.
In the *Claims* area, locate the `@auth:id=` tag.
Copy and paste the entire tag to a text editor, then delete the `@auth:id=` prefix.
This is your account ID.
In your terminal, use `apoctl` to log into the control plane as the company account administrator:
`+apoctl auth aporeto --account <account-name> -A <https://api-url>+`.
Use the following command to renew the certificate:
`apoctl api update account <account-id> -k LocalCARenew true -k LocalCA ""`.
* *#1302*: RHEL 8+ requires special configuration to work with the SSH access control feature.
