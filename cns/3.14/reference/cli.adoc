=== About apoctl

`apoctl` is the official command line tool (CLI) to interact with the Aporeto control plane.

=== Concepts

`apoctl` provides the following main commands:

* `api` to interact with the REST API
* `appcred` to manage app credentials
* `auth` to deal with authentication tokens
* `aws` to interact with AWS IAM roles
* `configure` for quick set up
* `enforcer` to obtain debug information
* `profiles` to manage multiple profiles
* `protect` to deploy the enforcer
* `reports` to generate compliance reports
* `ssh` to request and view Aporeto SSH certificates
* `stats` to retrieve statistical data
* `unprotect` to uninstall the enforcer

Here are the main global flags you can set:

* `--api` or `-A`: defines is the API endpoint
* `--namespace` or `-n`: defines is the namespace you want to target
* `--token` or `-t`: defines the token to use to authenticate
* `--config`: defines the path to a configuration profile to use
* `--log-level`: defines the level of logging

In general, every flag can be also set from an environment variable.
You can easily guess the environment variable by

* upper casing the flag name
* replace all `-` by `_`
* prefixing it by `APOCTL`

For instance, the variable used to set the above flags are:

 APOCTL_API
 APOCTL_NAMESPACE
 APOCTL_TOKEN
 APOCTL_LOG_LEVEL
 APOCTL_CONFIG

The resolution order is as follows from low to hight priority:

* built-in default value
* value set in a configuration profile
* value set the environment variables
* value set using the flags.

=== Autocompletion

`apoctl` supports autocompletion on `bash` and `zsh`.
It will autocomplete commands, API resources, attributes and more.

To take advantages of this feature, you must add a command in your shell configuration.

For Bash:

 echo "source <(apoctl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc

For ZSH:

 echo "source <(apoctl completion zsh)" >> ~/.zshrc

On CentOS, you may need to install the bash-completion package which is not installed by default.

 sudo yum install bash-completion -y

On macOS, you may need to install the bash-completion package which is not installed by default.

* If running Bash 3.2 included with macOS:

   brew install bash-completion

* If running Bash 4.1+:

   brew install bash-completion@2

=== Profiles

`apoctl` supports multiple configuration profiles that can be placed in `~/.apoctl`.

A profile is a simple YAML file setting default values for any flags of `apoctl`.
The most useful one is to set up your default namespace as well as an Application Credential to use.

All values defined in the profile, can be overridden by an environment variable or by setting the flag when you call `apoctl`.

The default profile is `~/.apoctl/default.yaml`.
If it doesn't exists, `apoctl` will use its built-in default values.

To select a profile, use the flag `--config`, set the environment variable `$APOCTL_CONFIG_NAME`,
or use `apoctl profiles` command.

For instance, you can create `~/.apoctl/my-profile.yaml` and tell `apoctl` to use it by running:

 export APOCTL_CONFIG_NAME=my-profile

Or

 apoctl profile use my-profile

In any case, to verify which profile is used, you can run `apoctl profiles`.

Note that the value of the variable must omit the extension.

Profile example:

 $ cat ~/.apoctl/default.yaml
 api: https://{{< ctrl-plane-api-url >}}
 namespace: /mycompany
 creds: ~/.apoctl/default.creds
 output: yaml

=== `api` command

The `api` command allows you to issue raw API requests.

==== `all` subcommand

The `all` subcommand prints the list of all existing API resources handled by `apoctl`.
It prints them in one line as it is mainly used for auto-completion.

Example:

 apoctl api all

To get one resource per line, you can do:

 apoctl api all | tr ' ' '\n'

==== `count` subcommand

The `count` subcommand allows to count the number of objects in a namespace.

* You can count objects in the namespace and all its child namespaces by using the flag `--recursive` (or `-r`).
* You can use a filter to only count matching objects using `--filter` (or `-f`).

For example:

 $ apoctl api count namespaces
 2

==== `create` subcommand

The `create` subcommand allows to create a new object in a namespace.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can use either the `-k` flag to set the value of an attribute, or you can pass a raw JSON object with `--data` (pr `-d`).

Example using keys:

 apoctl api create namespace \
   -k name mynamespace
   -k description "this is my namespace"

Example using JSON data:

 apoctl api create namespace -d '{
   "name": "mynamespace",
   "description": "this is my namespace"
 }'

===== Interactive mode

You can also create the object interactively by passing the `-i` option.
It will use the `$EDITOR` environment variable to select what editor to use.

To update, edit the desired fields, and save the file.
To discard, leave the editor without saving.

==== `delete` subcommand

The `delete` subcommand allows to delete an object.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can select the object to update by its `ID` or by its name.

Example using ID:

 apoctl api delete namespace 5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157

Example using name:

 apoctl api delete namespace /mycompany/ns-a

==== `delete-many` subcommand

The `delete-many` subcommand allows to delete multiple objects.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can pass a filter with the flag `--filter` (or `-f`) to only delete a subset of the objects.
* You can use the flag `--recursive` (or `-r`) to delete the objects in the current namespace and in the child namespaces.

If you don't pass a filter all objects in the namespace will be deleted.
As this is potentially dangerous, `apoctl` requires you to add the `--confirm` parameter.

Example:

 apoctl api delete-many namespace \
   --filter 'description == "to delete"' \
   --confirm

Example deleting recursively:

 apoctl api delete-many namespace \
   --filter 'description == "to delete"' \
   --recursive \
   --confirm

==== `describe` subcommand

The `describe` subcommand provides API documentation for all existing entities.

You can list all the available API by running:

 apoctl api all

Then for each of the, you can ask `apoctl` to print the documentation by doing:

 apoctl api describe namespace

You can get more documentation about each attribute of a resource by doing:

 apoctl api describe namespace --full

==== `export` subcommand

The `export` subcommand allows you to export data for later import.

The export file can stored in a file for later import.
You can select the identities you want to export by providing the
identities you want to export as arguments.

You can also set the export label with the flag `--label`.
If you don't set one, the control plane will generate a silly name
automatically.

You can use the parameter `--filter` to pass a filter expression.
If you do so, only the objects matching this filter will be exported.

Finally, if you pass `--base /path/to/previous/export`, the new exported
data will be added to the content of the base file.
Note that if you export twice the same object, you will have it twice in
the resulting export data.

Example:

 apoctl api export netpol extnet --label "my-import" > ./myimport.yaml
 apoctl api export automation --base ./myimport.yaml --filter 'associatedTags contains color=blue'

To get more information on how to reimport type `apoctl api import -h`.

==== `get` subcommand

The `get` subcommand allows to retrieve an existing object from a namespace.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can retrieve the object by giving its `ID` or its name.
* You can use the flag `--recursive` to find the object in the current namespace or in the child namespaces.

Example using ID:

 $ apoctl api get namespace 5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157 -c name
 {
     "name": "/mycompany/ns-a"
 }

Example using name:

 $ apoctl api get namespace /mycompany/ns-a -c ID
 {
     "ID": "5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157"
 }

If the name matches multiple objects, `apoctl` will return an error.

==== `import` subcommand

The `import` subcommand allows you to import object from a file
exported using the `export` subcommand.

To import from a file:

 apoctl api import -f ./myimport.yaml -n /dest/ns

You can also import data by reading from `stdin`:

 cat ./myimport.yaml | apoctl api import -f - -n /dest/ns

It is also possible to import from a remote file:

 apoctl api import --url https://myserver/myimport.yaml

You can always override the `label` declared in the file by using the
flag `--label`.

You can delete the data previously imported by using the `--delete` flag:

 apoctl api import --file ./myimport.yaml --delete

===== Templating

The `import` command supports templating. You can create generic import files
for a generic task, and configure various parts during the import procedure.

The template is using the `gotemplate` syntax (https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

There are two kind of templated values:

* `.Values.X`: configurable during import with the flag `--set X=Y`
* `.Aporeto.X`: computed by `apoctl`:
 ** `.Aporeto.API`: The target API URL
 ** `.Aporeto.Namespace`: The target namespace `apoctl` is pointing to

`apoctl` uses the Sprig library.
All the Sprig functions are available.
You can see the full list of functions at http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/.

===== Example

If we assume we have an import file looking like:

 APIVersion: 1
 label: allow-dns
 data:
   externalnetworks:
   - name: DNS
     associatedTags:
     - "ext:net=dns"
     entries:
     - 0.0.0.0/0
     servicePorts:
     - "udp/53"
   networkaccesspolicies:
   - name: allow-dns
     action: Allow
     propagate: {{ default .Values.propagate false }}
     subject:
     - - $identity=processingunit
       - $namespace={{ .Aporeto.Namespace }}
     object:
     - - "ext:net=dns"

You can render a template without importing it in by using the flag `--render`.

For instance, running on this file:

[,console]
----
$ apoctl api import --file my-import.yaml --render \
  -n /my/namespace \
  --set propagate=true

APIVersion: 1
label: allow-dns
data:
  externalnetworks:
  - name: DNS
    associatedTags:
    - "ext:net=dns"
    entries:
    - 0.0.0.0/0
    servicePorts:
    - "udp/53"
  networkaccesspolicies:
  - name: allow-dns
    action: Allow
    propagate: true
    subject:
    - - $identity=processingunit
      - $namespace=/my/namespace
    object:
    - - "ext:net=dns"
----

===== Using a values file

Instead of using `--set`, you can write a file setting the values then use this file to
populate the template values.

For instance you can write the file `values.yaml` containing:

 propagate: true

Then run:

 apoctl api import --file my-import.yaml --render --values ./values.yaml

This is strictly equivalent to the previous example.

===== Converting an import file to Kubernetes CRD

This is only useful if you use `aporeto-operator`.
You can convert an existing import file to the Kubernetes CRD managed by `aporeto-operator`
with the flag `--to-k8s-crd`.

For example:

 $ apoctl api import --file my-import.yaml --to-k8s-crd
 apiVersion: api.aporeto.io/v1beta1
 kind: ExternalNetwork
 metadata:
   name: DNS
 spec:
   associatedTags:
   - ext:net=dns
   entries:
   - 0.0.0.0/0
   servicePorts:
   - "udp/53"
 ---
 apiVersion: api.aporeto.io/v1beta1
 kind: NetworkAccessPolicy
 metadata:
   name: allow-dns
 spec:
   action: Allow
   object:
   - - ext:net=dns
   propagate: true
   subject:
   - - $identity=processingunit
     - $namespace=/my/namespace

You can use this command to directly import the file into Kubernetes with the command:

 apoctl api import --file my-import.yaml --to-k8s-crd | kubectl apply -f -

==== `info` subcommand

The `info` subcommand prints the actual API configuration `apoctl` is pointing to.
This command is useful to verify exactly where the subsequent commands will issued to avoid any mistakes.

It prints:

* The current API URL
* The current namespace
* The eventual currently used appcred path

The printed data can also be used to create a configuration profile:

 apoctl api info > ~/.apoctl/my-profile.yaml

==== `list` subcommand

The `list` subcommand allows to list all the objects in a namespace.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can list all objects in the namespace and all its child namespaces by using the flag `--recursive` (or `-r`).

For example:

 $ apoctl api list namespaces -n /mycompany -c ID -c name -c namespace
 [
   {
     "ID": "5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157",
     "name": "/mycompany/ns-a",
     "namespace": "/mycompany",
   },
   {
     "ID": "5b490ecc7ddf1f2a37742285",
     "name": "/mycompany/ns-b",
     "namespace": "/mycompany",
   }
 ]

To get the data formatted as YAML:

 $ apoctl api list namespaces -n /mycompany -o yaml -c ID -c name -c namespace
 - ID: 5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157
   name: /mycompany/ns-a
   namespace: /mycompany"
 - ID: 5b490ecc7ddf1f2a37742285
   name: /mycompany/ns-b
   namespace: /mycompany"

To get the data formatted in a table:

[,console]
----
$ apoctl api list namespaces -n /mycompany -o table -c ID -c name -c namespace

            ID            |      name       | namespace
+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------+
  5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157 | /mycompany/ns-b | /mycompany
  5b490ecc7ddf1f2a37742285 | /mycompany/ns-a | /mycompany
----

You can pass a filter to search for something in particular using the `--filter` flag or `-f` shorthand.

 apoctl api list namespaces --filter 'name == /mycompany/ns-a or name == /mycompany/ns-b'

==== `listen` subcommand

The `listen` subcommand allows to connect to the Aporeto control plane event channel
and print the events.

To listen to events on the current namespace:

 apoctl api listen

To listen to events on the current namespace recursively:

 apoctl api listen -r

To only listen to events for a particular API resource:

 apoctl api listen --identity processingunit

If the connection get interrupted, `apoctl` will print an error and will
try to reconnect until the command is interrupted.

Note that any events that occurred during a disconnection will not be
recovered.

==== `search` subcommand

The `search` subcommand performs a full text search on your namespaces.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can list all objects in the namespace and all its child namespaces by using the flag `--recursive` (or `-r`).

For instance:

 apoctl api search mythings
 apoctl api search "+identity:enforcer data.type:docker" -r -c name

You can find more information about the query language http://blevesearch.com/docs/Query-String-Query/[here].

==== `stub` subcommand

The `stub` subcommand prints a YAML or JSON skeleton of the attributes of an API resource.

For instance:

 $ apoctl api stub extnet
 annotations: {}
 associatedTags: []
 description: ""
 entries: null
 metadata: []
 name: ""
 servicePorts:
 - "tcp/1:65535"
 protected: false

You can also set a different level of indentation with the flag `--indent`.

==== `update` subcommand

The `update` subcommand allows to update an existing object from a namespace.

* You can control the output format using the `--output` flag (or `-o`).
* You can ask for a subset of the attributes to be displayed by using the flag `-c`.
* You can use the flag `--recursive` to find the object in the current namespace or in the child namespaces.
* You can select the object to update by its `ID` or by its name.
* You can use the `-k` flags to send individual keys or `-d` to send JSON data.

Example using ID:

 apoctl api update namespace 5c364e0d7ddf1f3cf70b3157 \
   -k description "new description"

Example using name:

 apoctl api update namespace /mycompany/ns-a -d '{
     "description": "new description"
 }'

===== Interactive mode

You can also edit the object interactively by passing the `-i` option.
It will use the `$EDITOR` environment variable to select what editor to use.

To update, edit the desired fields, and save the file.
To discard, leave the editor without saving.

=== `appcred` command

The `appcred` command allows you to manage app credentials.

While it is also possible to manage them with the `apoctl api` command,
this requires you to issue X.509 certificate requests and generate
private keys, etcetera, which can be a bit tedious.
The `appcred` command wraps all of this in a easy-to-use command.

==== `create` subcommand

The `create` subcommand allows to create a new Application Credential.
It will generate a private key locally and issue a CSR to the control
plane, create the Application Credential with the provided roles and
write the result in `stdout`.

You must at least provide one role using the flag `--role`.
To list all existing roles, you can use `apoctl api list roles -c key -c description`.

You can define a list of subnets using the flag `--authorized-subnet`.
If set, the underlying API Authorization Policy will only be active if the
request using a token issued from this app cred is made from an IP included
in the declared subnets.

===== App credential types

`apoctl` can output app credentials in multiple formats:

* JSON (default)
* Kubernetes Secret
* X509 Certificate

===== JSON

This is the default format.
It outputs data you can write in a file that you can use to retrieve
an Aporeto token.

Example:

 apoctl appcred create mycreds -n /my/ns \
   --role @auth:role=namespace.viewer \
   > mycreds.json

===== Kubernetes secret

This format wraps the data in the JSON format into a Kubernetes
secret definition.
This secret can then be mounted by Pods to access the Aporeto API.
You can pipe the output directly to the `kubectl` command to deploy
the secret on your Kubernetes cluster.

Example:

 apoctl appcred create enforcerd \
   --role @auth:role=enforcer \
   --type k8s \
   | kubectl apply -f -

===== X.509 Certificates

This format extracts the certificates contained in the Aporeto format and write them in a
separate certificate and key in PEM format that you can use with anything supporting PEM files.

Example:

 apoctl appcred create mycreds \
   -n /my/ns \
   --role @auth:role=namespace.viewer \
   --type cert

You can make a `PKCS12` bundle out of the create PEM files and import it
in your system key chain to use it to connect from a web browser (this required `openssl`
command to be installed).

Example:

 openssl pkcs12 -export -out mycreds.p12 \
   -inkey mycreds-key.pem \
   -in mycreds-cert.pem

==== `delete` subcommand

The `delete` subcommand allows you to delete an existing app credential.
You can either use its ID or its name if it is unique in the namespace.

Deleting an app credential immediately revokes the associated certificates.
This means that all clients using it will see their API calls denied
immediately.

Example:

 apoctl appcred delete mycreds -n /my/ns

==== `disable` subcommand

The `disable` subcommand allows you to temporarily disable an
existing app credential.

Disabling an app credential will be effective immediately.
This means that all clients using it will see their API calls denied
until it is enabled again.

Example:

 apoctl appcred disable mycreds -n /my/ns

==== `enable` subcommand

The `enable` subcommand allows you to re-enable a disabled app credential.
Enabling an app credential will be effective immediately.

Example:

 apoctl appcred enable mycreds -n /my/ns

==== `list` subcommand

The `list` subcommand allows you to list existing app credentials.

You can print the app credentials in the current namespace and
all of its children by using the flag `--recursive`.

Example:

 apoctl appcred list -r

==== `renew` subcommand

The `renew` subcommand allows to renew the underlying certificates
of an existing app credential.
You can either use its ID or its name if it is unique in the namespace.

Renewing an app credential will revoke the associated certificates
after a grace period of 12 hours.
This means that all clients using it will see their API calls denied
after this period.

You can use the `--type` flag to control the output type in the same
way than for the `create` subcommand.

Example:

 apoctl appcred renew mycreds -n /my/ns

==== `roles` subcommand

The `roles` subcommand allows you to update the roles associated with
an app credential.

You must at least provide one role using the flag `--role`.
To list all existing roles, you can use `apoctl api list roles -c key -c description`.

Example:

 apoctl appcred roles my-credentials \
   --role "@auth:role=enforcer" \
   --role "@auth:role=aporeto-operator"

==== `subnets` subcommand

The `subnets` subcommand allows you to update the subnets associated with an
app credential.

Example:

 apoctl appcred roles my-credentials \
   --authorized-subnet "10.0.0.0/8" \
   --authorized-subnet "192.168.0.0/16"

=== `auth` command

The `auth` command is used to retrieve an Aporeto token.

 eval $(apoctl auth aporeto --account mycompany -e)
 Aporeto account password:

This stores your token in the environment variable `APOCTL_TOKEN`.

You can set the validity of the token by passing the global flag `--validity`.

Example:

 apoctl auth <subcommand> --validity 2h

You can set the maximum number of times the token can be used by passing
the global flag `--quota`.

Example:

 apoctl auth <subcommand> --quota 4

If you like to issue a token that would end up having less permissions than
you initially have, you can use the following options:

* `--restrict-namespace`: The token will only be valid in the given namespace and below,
provided you initially have the permissions on that namespace.
* `--restrict-role`: The token will only be valid for the give role or raw permission,
provided you initially have these permissions.
* `--restrict-network`: The token will only be valid if used from the given networks,
provided you initially have these permissions.

Example:

 apoctl auth  <subcommand> \
   --restrict-namespace /namespace/child \
   --restrict-role '@auth:role=enforcer' \
   --restrict-role '@auth:role=enforcer.runtime' \
   --restrict-network 10.0.0.0/8 \
   --restrict-network 192.168.0.0/16

You can set opaque data by passing the flag `--opaque`.
Opaque data will be added in the `opaque` property of the issued token.
They cannot be used in authorization policies but they can be used by various
clients as trusted hints from an authenticated user.

Example:

 apoctl auth <subcommand> --opaque key1:value1 --opaque key2:value2

==== `aporeto` subcommand

The `aporeto` subcommand allows you to retrieve an Aporeto token using your Aporeto
company account credentials.

You must provide your account name.

 apoctl auth aporeto --account mycompany

If you don't set the `--password` flag, `apoctl` will prompt for your password.

If you have enabled Two-Factor Authentication, you need to pass the one time password:

 apoctl auth aporeto --account mycompany --otp 123456

==== `appcred` subcommand

The `appcred` subcommand allows you to retrieve an Aporeto token using an
app credential file.

Example:

 apoctl auth appcred --path /path/to/creds.json

==== `aws-st` subcommand

The `aws-st` subcommand allows you to retrieve an Aporeto token using Amazon
Security Token Service (AWS STS).

If you are running this command on an AWS instance, `apoctl` will automatically
probe the metadata API, and you just need to run:

 apoctl auth aws-st

Otherwise you can run:

 apoctl auth aws-st \
   --access-key-id ACCESS_KEY_ID \
   --secret-access-key SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
   --access-token ACCESS_TOKEN

==== `azure` subcommand

The `azure` subcommand allows to retrieve an Aporeto token using an Azure Identity Token.

If you are running this command on an Azure instance, `apoctl` will automatically
probe the metadata API, and you just need to run:

 apoctl auth azure

Otherwise you can run:

 apoctl auth azure --token ACCESS_TOKEN

==== `cert` subcommand

The `cert` subcommand retrieves an Aporeto token using a X.509 certificate.

If you have a certificate and key PEM file, run:

 apoctl auth cert --cert cert.pem --key key.pem

If you have a PKCS12 bundle, run:

 apoctl auth cert --p12 cert.p12 --p12-pass passphrase

==== `gcp` subcommand

The `gcp` subcommand allows to retrieve an Aporeto token using a Google
Cloud Platform Identity Token.

If you are running this command on an GCP instance, `apoctl` will automatically
probe the metadata API, and you just need to run:

 apoctl auth gcp

Otherwise you can run:

 apoctl auth gcp --token ACCESS_TOKEN

==== `google` subcommand

The `google` subcommand allows to retrieve an Aporeto token using Google single sign-on.

It will open a browser window to allow you to login.
This means for this authentication method to work, `apoctl` needs to be run in a
graphical environment.

Example:

 apoctl auth google

You can choose the browser to use by setting the flag `--open-with`.

For instance:

 apoctl auth google --open-with 'Google Chrome'

==== `ldap` subcommand

The `ldap` subcommand is used to retrieve an Aporeto token using one of the LDAP
providers configured in your namespace.

If you have not configured one, this authentication will not work.

Example:

 apoctl auth ldap \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider oldap \
   --username LDAP_USER_NAME \
   --password LDAP_USER_PASSWORD

==== `oidc` subcommand

The `oidc` subcommand allows to retrieve an Aporeto token using an OIDC provider.

The provider must be first configured in your Aporeto namespace for this authentication
method to work.

It will open a browser window to allow you to login.
This means for this authentication method to work, `apoctl` needs to be run in a
graphical environment.

You must also know the OIDC provider name that has been configured if there is no default one.

For example:

 apoctl auth oidc \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider Auth0

You can choose the browser to use by setting the flag `--open-with`.

For instance:

 apoctl auth oidc \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider Auth0 \
   --open-with Firefox

==== `pcc-token` subcommand

The `pcc-token` subcommand allows you to retrieve an Aporeto token using an already
delivered PCC identity token.

The provider must be first configured in your Aporeto namespace for this authentication
method to work.

You must also know the PCC provider name that has been configured if there is no default one.

If you omit the flag `--token`, it will be prompted from the standard input.

For example:

 apoctl auth pcc-token \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider p1 \
   --token xxx.xxxxxx.xxx

==== `pcc` subcommand

The `pcc` subcommand allows to retrieve an Aporeto token using a PCC user and password.

For example:

 apoctl auth pcc \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider p1 \
   --user username

==== `saml` subcommand

The `saml` subcommand allows you to retrieve an Aporeto token using an SAML provider.

SAML requires the auth callback to be using HTTPS.
For this command to work you must first trust the apoctl certificate authority (CA)
by typing:

 apoctl auth saml --print-ca > /tmp/apoctl-ca.cert

Then you must make your OS/browser to trust this CA.

The provider must be first configured in your Aporeto namespace for this authentication
method to work.

It will open a browser window to allow you to login.
This means for this authentication method to work, `apoctl` needs to be run in a
graphical environment.

You must also know the SAML provider name that has been configured if there is no default one.

For example:

 apoctl auth saml \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider okta

You can choose the browser to use by setting the flag `--open-with`.

For instance:

 apoctl auth saml \
   --namespace /namespace \
   --provider okta \
   --open-with "Google Chrome"

==== `verify` subcommand

The `verify` subcommand allows you to verify and print information about an Aporeto
token.

Example:

 apoctl auth verify --token secret-token
 {
   "aud": "{{< ctrl-plane-api-url >}}",
   "data": {
       "account": "myaccount",
       "email": "me@myaccount.com",
       "id": "5be902701d6cb60001e2881f",
       "organization": "myaccount",
       "realm": "vince"
   },
   "exp": 1540493393,
   "iat": 1540403393,
   "iss": "midgard.{{< ctrl-plane-api-url >}}",
   "realm": "Vince",
   "sub": "1234567890"
 }

Note that if `$APOCTL_TOKEN` is set, you can just run:

 apoctl auth verify

=== `aws` command

The `aws` command provides a range of capabilities for interacting
with the AWS roles. It allows the definition of flexible policy files
that map specific users or Aporeto processing units to specific AWS roles with
corresponding privileges.

Examples:

 apoctl aws create -f ./policy.yaml

==== `create` subcommand

The `create` subcommand creates a role in AWS given the required privileges,
associate the role with the OAUTH definition of the current namespace and
configures the right Aporeto policies so that Processing Units or users
that are protected by Aporeto policies can retrieve an ephemeral token
that gives them access to the specific resources.

Examples:

 apoctl aws create -f ./policy.yaml

==== `delete` subcommand

The `delete` subcommand deletes the AWS role provided together with all
the associated policies and Aporeto token scope policies. It is assumed
that the objects have been created with the `create` subcommand.

Examples:

 apoctl aws delete --awsrole=myrole

==== `list-accesses` subcommand

The `list-accesses` subcommand will list all the API accesses of an Aporeto
protected object, such as a processing unit or an SSH session towards specific
AWS resources.

Examples:

 apoctl aws list-accesses -id <pu ID>

=== `configure` command

The `configure` command is used to quickly configure `apoctl`.

Calling `configure` will

* Create an ~/.apoctl folder
* Generate an app credential
* Write a configuration file pointing to that app credential

Example:

 apoctl configure --namespace /me --token <token>

This will create:

 $ ls ~/.apoctl
 default.creds default.yaml

You can also use `--name` to change the configuration name to something else.
This way, you can manage multiple configuration file.

If you try to run `configure` but the configuration file, appcred file or appcred object exist,
apoctl will return an error unless you pass `--force`.

By default, `configure` will try to apply the role `@auth:role=namespace.editor`.
You may not have these privileges.
In that can you can set the flag `--role` to use a different role.

=== `enforcer` command

The `enforcer` command allows the management of the enforcer.

==== `collect` subcommand

The `collect` subcommand is used to collect debug information from the enforcer.

The enforcer is notify that it should collect and reports its debug information.
The command waits until the collection is completed and invites the user to use
the `download` subcommand.

Examples:

 apoctl enforcer collect counters 981e92db0290
 apoctl enforcer collect logs 981e92db0290

==== `download` subcommand

This `download` subcommand is used to download debug information from the enforcer.

It downloads the latest information sent by the enforcer. If you did not run the `collect` subcommand,
you will receive the previous information.

Examples:

 apoctl enforcer download 981e92db0290
 apoctl enforcer download 981e92db0290 -f /tmp/enforcer-981e92db0290.tar.gz

=== `profiles` command

The `profiles` command is used to manage multiple `apoctl` profiles.
Without additional commands, it will print the list of available profiles,
and which one is currently used.

Example:

 $ apoctl profiles
 CURRENT   NAME      API                               NAMESPACE            APPCRED
 >         saas      https://api.console.aporeto.com   /jean                true
 *         internal  https://api.aporeto.acme.com      /michel (appcred)    true

You can switch the current profile by using `apoctl profile use [profile name]`.

The symbols in the `CURRENT` column means the following:

* `*`: default profile to use when nothing else is configured
* `>`: the profile currently in use if `APOCTL_CONFIG_NAME` is set

==== `set` subcommand

The `set` subcommand is used to switch the current profile.
You can also use the alias `use`.

Example:

 $ apoctl profiles use preprod
 current profile set to preprod

You can switch the current profile by using `apoctl profile use [profile name]`.

The current profile will be overridden in the following cases:

* you have defined `APOCTL_CONFIG_NAME`
* you have passed the flag `--config`

[#_protect-command]
=== `protect` command

The `protect` command is used to deploy the enforcer on various platforms.
Depending on the platform, it will perform the various needed tasks
to deploy the enforcer and protect your workload.

==== `k8s` subcommand

The `k8s` subcommand can be used to deploy the Aporeto enforcer and operator
on a Kubernetes cluster.

Running it over a cluster where everything is already installed will perform
an upgrade if needed.

By default, it will target the cluster described by the `kubectl` current context.
You can use a different context by using the flag `--k8s.context`.

In order to deploy the enforcer and operator and needed CRDs, apoctl uses Helm charts.
You can use a custom helm repository by using the flag `--repo`.
(note that having helm command line or tiller is not needed).

Helm values can be set by using the `--set` flag in the form `[key]=[value]`.
Used as is, the defined values will apply to both Enforcerd and Operator.
You can choose to set a particular value only for a component by prefixing
the key by either `enforcerd:[key]=[value]` or `operator:[key]=[value]`.

By default, the latest versions of the charts will be installed.
You can always list all the available versions by using the flag `--list`.
You can then choose a particular version using the flags `--version.crds`,
`--version.enforcerd` and `--version.operator`.

Apoctl will install the necessary Aporeto constructs in the namespace currently
targeted by apoctl with the standard `--namespace` flag.

Examples:

 apoctl protect k8s
 apoctl protect k8s --list
 apoctl protect k8s --set imageRegistry=myprivatehub/aporeto --set enforcerd:enableCompressedTags=1

==== `linux` subcommand

The `linux` subcommand can be used to deploy the Aporeto enforcer on a Linux host.

It requires root privileges.
Either prefix the command with `sudo` or open a root shell using `sudo su`.

By default, apoctl will query the Aporeto control plane for the local installation
repositories and will detect the current Linux distribution and which installation
procedure is the more suited for it.

It will create app credentials in the targeted namespace, install them on the
host, and deploy an enforcer.

If you want to follow what the command does, you can use the flag `--verbose`.

You can skip app credential creation by passing the `--cloud-auth` flag.
This will let enforcer use cloud-based authentication.

You can define additional enforcer tags by using the flags `--tag`.
Note that the tags given this way cannot contain any space.

Finally, you can pass additional raw flags that will be forwarded to the enforcer
by using the flag `--raw-flags`.

Examples:

 apoctl protect linux --namespace /my/namespace --token <token>
 apoctl protect linux --docker
 apoctl protect linux --tag color=blue --tag size=big

==== `linux-remote` subcommand

The `linux-remote` subcommand allows you to install the enforcer on one or multiple hosts
using SSH.
It will connect to the provided hosts, make them download `apoctl` and
run `apoctl protect linux` remotely.

This subcommand supports protecting various Linux distributions at once.

It also supports the flags supported by `apoctl protect linux` so they
will be forwarded to the remote installation process.

You can pass the list of hosts as:

* arguments
* `stdin` using the flag `--file -` (the default)
* a file using the flag `--file /path/to/file`

This command assumes the following:

* You own an SSH key allowing to connect the hosts.
* You can `sudo` on the remote hosts without entering a password
* The host has `curl` installed.

Note that you can pass multiple SSH keys.
All the hosts should be able to use at least one of the provided key.
Password authentication is not supported.

You can define how many hosts to protect in parallel by using the flag
`--concurrency`.

Examples:

 apoctl protect linux-remote --docker user@host user@host1:2222
 cat myhosts | apoctl protect linux-remote

=== `reports` command

The `reports` command enables the generation of various reports based on the Aporeto data.
Currently it only supports one report type: `compliance`.

Examples:

 apoctl reports compliance --selector \$identity=processingunit --selector type=aporeto --format=csv

==== `compliance` subcommand

The `compliance` subcommand allows you to create simple compliance
reports based on the policies associated with a namespace. The
report can be exported either as a table or in CSV format.

You must provide a list of tag selectors that will select the
Processing Units for which the compliance report must be run.
The default output format is a table.

Examples:

 apoctl reports compliance --selector \$identity=processingunit --selector type=aporeto --format=csv

=== `ssh` command

The `ssh` command allows you to manage SSH certificates and provides
helpers to connect to an OpenSSH server protected by Aporeto.

==== `cert` subcommand

The `cert` subcommand will use the current token and exchange it for
an SSH Identity Certificate containing the claims and the permissions
configured in the Control Plane.

You need to pass a public SSH key for this API to work.
By default, `apoctl` will look in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
You can pass a different public key with the flag `--public-key`.

If you need to create a new ssh key, you can use the ssh tool `ssh-keygen`.

The delivered SSH Certificate will be printed in `stdout`.

Example:

 apoctl ssh cert > ~/.ssh/my-cert.pub

==== `connect` subcommand

The `connect` subcommand is a wrapper around the system ssh command.
You can use it to connect to a remote host protected by an Aporeto
Enforcer.
The command will automatically request a SSH certificate
from the Control Plane according to your authorizations based on
your Aporeto Token.
It will use this certificate immediately to connect to the ssh host.

By default, it will look for ssh keys in `~/.ssh`.
You can set a different key to use with the flag `--public-key`.

You can bypass the certificate issuing process if you already have
one on file by setting the flag `--cert` (in that case `--public-key`
has no effect).
If you pass `--cert` you need either your SSH agent to known the ssh key
used to generate the cert, or you need to pass it using the `--key` flag.

You then pass any arguments, they will be forwarded to the ssh command.

Examples:

 apoctl ssh connect user@host.com
 apoctl ssh connect -- user@host.com -p 2222
 apoctl ssh connect --cert my-cert.cert user@host.com
 apoctl ssh connect --cert my-cert.cert --key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@host.com

==== `inspect` subcommand

The `inspect` subcommand can be used to print information about
an existing SSH Identity Certificate.

The `inspect` subcommand can read the data from `stdin` when the flag `--cert`
is set to `-` (default) or can be given a path.

Example:

 cat ~/.ssh/my-cert.pub | apoctl ssh inspect
 apoctl ssh inspect --cert ~/.ssh/my-cert.pub

=== `stats` command

The `stats` command allows you to easily query the `statistics` endpoint of the Control Plane API.

==== `info` subcommand

The `info` subcommand allows to retrieve info about the fields and tags
of a measurement.

You must pass a valid measurement as the first parameter.
That can be one of:

* `flows`
* `eventlogs`
* `enforcers`
* `audit`
* `files`
* `accesses`
* `packets`
* `dnslookups`

Example:

 apoctl stats info eventlogs

==== `query` subcommand

The `query` subcommand allows to send a query to the Aporeto Statistics API.

You must pass a valid measurement as the first parameter.
That can be one of:

* `accesses`
* `audit`
* `counters`
* `dnslookups`
* `enforcers`
* `enforcertraces`
* `eventlogs`
* `files`
* `flows`
* `packets`
* `pingreports`

===== Fields selection

By default, all fields will be retrieved.
You can pass additional arguments to restrict the fields you want to retrieve.

Example:

 apoctl stats query flows value srcid destid

Note that at least one field must be passed in addition to a single `tag`.
To get the list of tags versus fields, you can use the `info` subcommand.

===== Aggregation functions

You can apply aggregation functions to a field you pass.
Most of the available InfluxQL functions apply.

The most relevant ones are:

* `COUNT()`
* `DISTINCT()`
* `MEAN()`
* `MEDIAN()`
* `SUM()`
* `BOTTOM()`
* `FIRST()`
* `LAST()`
* `MAX()`
* `MIN()`
* `PERCENTILE()`
* `TOP()`
* `ABS()`
* `FLOOR()`
* `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()`
* `ROUND()`

The full list and documentation is available at https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/functions/.

Example:

 apoctl stats query flows 'sum(value)' --group action

===== Time window

You can define the time window with the flags `--from`, `--to`, `--from-rel` or `--to-rel`.
If you don't set any time limit, `apoctl` will make a call on the last hour.

To pass a relative time window:

 apoctl stats query flows --from-rel 10s -n /my/namespace --filter 'id == xxxx'

To pass an absolute time window:

 apoctl stats eventlogs content id --from 2018-01-01 --to 2018-02-02

The complete list of supported dat formats is described at https://github.com/araddon/dateparse.

===== Filtering

The `--filter` flag allows to reduce the results to data matching your condition.
The syntax is identical to all other Aporeto filters.

Example:

 apoctl stats query flows
   --filter "srcid == xxxxx or (action == reject and destid != yyyy)"

===== Grouping

You can group the result using one or more available tags using the `--group` flag.

Example:

 apoctl stats query flows 'sum(value)' --group action

To group by time you must use the key `time(duration)`

Example:

 apoctl stats query flows 'sum(value)' --group "time(1w)"

Notes:

* You must use an aggregation function when you use groups.
* You can only group on tags, not on fields.
To get the list of tags and fields, use the `info` subcommand.

===== Display

By default the `query` command displays the results in a table.
If you want to see the raw JSON response, you can use the flag `--output`.

Example:

 apoctl stats query flows --output json

=== `unprotect` command

The `unprotect` command is used to uninstall enforcers
installed with the `protect` command.

==== `k8s` subcommand

The `k8s` subcommand can be used to uninstall the enforcer and operator
from a Kubernetes cluster.

By default, it will target the cluster described by the `kubectl` current context.
You can use a different context by using the flag `--k8s.context`.

It will clean the Helm charts deployed on the cluster, remove any installed
CRDs, remove the Aporeto-specific Kubernetes namespaces, and clean up the
Aporeto namespace from any resources previously created by the `protect`
command.

Example:

 apoctl unprotect k8s --k8s.context mycluster

==== `linux` subcommand

____
note: you need to run this command as root.
____

The `linux` subcommand can be used to uninstall the enforcer from a Linux host.

By default, apoctl will detect the current Linux distribution and which uninstall
procedure is more suited for it.

It will delete the app credentials from the targeted namespace and uninstall
the enforcer.

If you want to follow what the command does, you can use the flag `--verbose`.

If the enforcer was installed as a container, you need to pass the flag `--docker`.

To leave the Aporeto repositories configured in the machine, pass
the flag `--soft`.

Examples:

 apoctl unprotect linux -n /my/namespace
 apoctl unprotect linux --docker --soft

==== `linux-remote` subcommand

The `linux-remote` subcommand allows you to remove the enforcer from one or multiple hosts
using SSH.
It will connect to the provided hosts, make them download `apoctl` and
run `apoctl unprotect linux` remotely.

This subcommand supports unprotected various Linux distributions at once.

It also supports the flags supported by `apoctl unprotect linux` so they
will be forwarded to the remote installation process.

You can pass the list of hosts as:

* arguments
* `stdin` using the flag `--file -` (the default)
* a file using the flag `--file /path/to/file`

This command assumes the following:

* You own an SSH key allowing to connect the hosts.
* You can `sudo` on the remote hosts without entering a password
* The host has `curl` installed.

Note that you can pass multiple SSH keys.
All the hosts should be able to use at least one of the provided key.
Password authentication is not supported.

You can define how many hosts to protect in parallels by using the flag
`--concurrency`.

Examples:

 apoctl unprotect linux-remote --docker user@host user@host1:2222
 cat myhosts | apoctl unprotect linux-remote
