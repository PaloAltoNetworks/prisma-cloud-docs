=== Enabling backups

If you did not enable backups when you created your Voila environment, use the following command to enable them.

[,console]
----
set_value global.backup.enabled true override
----

Then run `doit` to deploy the backup jobs.

[NOTE]
====
The backup job schedule can be changed with:

* `set_value backup.schedule " 0 0 * * *" mongodb-backup override`
* `set_value backup.schedule " 0 0 * * *" influxdb-backup override`
====

=== Available operations

The `voila` installer container comes with a set of tools including some for backup/restore:

* `backup`: This is a tool to trigger backup operation on InfluxDB and MongoDB databases.
* `restore`: This is a tool to perform backup restore operation on InfluxDB and MongoDB databases.

==== Backup

The `backup` tool allows you to trigger a backup whenever you want. Just type `backup` and follow the prompt.

==== Restore

The `restore` tool allows you to restore a database using previous backup and allows you to perform four kinds of actions:

* Restore from a backup
* Enter the container for advanced backup actions
* Push files from your machine to the backup container
* Fetch files from the backup container to your machine

=== Backing up the Voila environment

A voila environment is set with a version control system (git).

Each time you exit an xref:start/control-plane/large-deployments/deploy.adoc#activate[activated voila environment], it will commit its changes and encrypt private information like:

* certificates in `./certs` folder
* `aporeto.yaml`

This means that if the Voila environment is *not* activated, you cannot edit those files.

Once xref:start/control-plane/large-deployments/deploy.adoc#activate[activated], the files are decrypted and you can edit them either from the Voila shell, or from the machine that is mounting the Voila environment.

The Voila environment *MUST* be saved as its your entry point to manage Aporeto control plane upgrades and operations.

The recommended way is to push the Voila environment to a git remote repository like GitHub or GitLab.

If you don't have a git remote repository infrastructure, just make sure to backup the Voila environment to a safe place each time you are done using it.
