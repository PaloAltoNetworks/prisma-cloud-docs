Aporeto protects cloud applications from attack by authenticating and authorizing all communications with a cryptographically signed identity assigned to every workload.
Aporeto alleviates reliance on unmanageable error-prone IP white-list policies.
A distributed homogeneous security policy is enforced per workload independent of network or infrastructure configuration, enabling uniform security orchestration across multi-cloud environments.
