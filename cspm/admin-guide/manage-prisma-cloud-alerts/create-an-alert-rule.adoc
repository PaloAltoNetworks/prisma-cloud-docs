== Create an Alert Rule for Run-Time Checks

Use alert rules to define the policy rule violations within specific cloud accounts that trigger alert notifications to a particular destination.

If you want to create an alert rule for workload protection, see xref:../prisma-cloud-policies/workload-protection-policies.adoc#create-alert-workload-policy[Workload Protection].

After you have deployed your resources on the cloud platform of your choice, alert rules (for run-time checks) enable you to define the policy violations in a selected set of cloud accounts for which you want to trigger alerts.

When you create an alert rule for run-time checks, you select the account groups to which the rule applies and the corresponding set of policies for which you want to trigger alerts. You can add more granularity to the rule by excluding some cloud accounts from the selected account groups, by specifying specific regions for which to send alerts, and even by narrowing down the rule to specific cloud resources identified by resource tags. This provides you with flexibility in how you manage alerts and ensures that you can adhere to the administrative boundaries you defined. You can create a single alert rule that alerts on all policy rules or you can define granular alert rules that send very specific sets of alerts for specific cloud accounts, regions, and even resources to specific destinations.

When you create an alert rule, you can xref:configure-prisma-cloud-to-automatically-remediate-alerts.adoc#id77ff61ca-a7ae-4830-9c47-516c79be3f9a[Configure Prisma Cloud to Automatically Remediate Alerts], which enables Prisma Cloud to automatically run the CLI command required to remediate the policy violation directly in your cloud environments. Automated remediation is only available for default policies (Config policies only) that are designated as Remediable (image:remediable-icon.png[scale=90]) on the *Policies* page.

In addition, if you xref:../configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud.adoc#id24911ff9-c9ec-4503-bb3a-6cfce792a70d[Configure External Integrations on Prisma Cloud] with third-party tools, defining granular alert rules enables you to send only the alerts you need to enhance your existing operational, ticketing, notification, and escalation workflows with the addition of Prisma Cloud alerts on policy violations in all your cloud environments. To see any existing integrations, go to menu:Settings[Integrations].

[.procedure]
. Select menu:Alerts[Alert Rules] and *Add Alert Rule*.

. In *Add Details*, enter a *Name* for the alert rule and, optionally, a *Description* to communicate the purpose of the rule.

.. You can enable the optional *Auto-Actions*, *Alert Notifications*, and *Auto-Remediation* settings up front. If you enable any of these options, they are displayed as additional steps in the alert rule creation process, for example, if you enable *Alert Notifications*, the *Configure Notifications* step is displayed.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you enable *Automated-Remediation*, the list of policies shows only Remediable (image:remediable-icon.png[scale=90]) policies
====

.. *Next*.

. *Assign Targets* to add more granularity for which cloud resources trigger alerts for this alert rule, and then provide more criteria as needed:

.. Select the *Account Groups* to which you want this alert rule to apply.

.. *Exclude Cloud Accounts and Regions* from your selected Account Group—If there are some cloud accounts and regions in the selected account groups for which you do not want to trigger alerts, select the accounts and regions from the list.

.. Select *Include Tag Resource Lists* to easily manage or identify the type of your resources—To trigger alerts only for specific resources in the selected cloud accounts, enter the *Key* and *Value* of the resource tag you created for the resource in your cloud environment. Tags apply only to *Config* and *Network* policies. When you add multiple resource tags, it uses the boolean logical OR operator.

.. After defining the target cloud resources, click *Next*.
+

. Select the policies for which you want this alert rule to trigger alerts and, optionally, xref:configure-prisma-cloud-to-automatically-remediate-alerts.adoc#id77ff61ca-a7ae-4830-9c47-516c79be3f9a[Configure Prisma Cloud to Automatically Remediate Alerts].

.. Either *Select All Policies* or select the specific policies that match the filter criteria for which you want to trigger alerts on this alert rule. Selecting *All Policies* will create a large volume of alerts. It is recommended that you use granular filtered selection for more relevant and targeted alerts specific to your requirement.

.. *Add Filter* (image:add-alert-rule-add-filter.png[scale=70]) to filter better while selecting policies. You can filter by *Policy Severity*, *Cloud Type*, *Compliance Standard*, and *Policy Label*. As you select the filters, the results listed the table are refreshed automatically. *Reset Filters* (image:add-alert-rule-reset-filter.png[scale=70]) to remove the filter selection.
+
[NOTE]
====
*Include new policies matching filter criteria* will be enabled when you select at least one of the filters and then select all rows in the table by selecting the top checkbox in the first column of the table. Once enabled, new policies that are added later and filtered based on the same criteria will be automatically included.
====

.. To help you find the specific group of policies for which you want this rule to alert:
+
* *Filter Results*—Enter a *Search* term to filter the list of policies to those with specific keywords.
* *Column Picker*—Click *Edit* (image:column-picker.png[scale=70]) to modify which columns to display.
* *Sort*—Click the corresponding *Sort* icon (image:sort-column.png[scale=70]) to sort on a specific column.
* *Fullscreen*—Click *View in Fullscreen mode* (image:add-alert-rule-fullscreen.png[scale=80])to see an expanded view of the table.

.. *Next*.

. (tt:[Optional]) You can automatically dismiss alerts that have specific tags as defined on the resource and added to the Resource Lists on Prisma Cloud. The details of the reason for dismissal is included in the alert rule L2 view. If you enabled ^tt:[Limited GA]^*Auto-Actions* in the *Add Details* screen, when you update an alert rule, all existing alerts with matching tags are auto dismissed. When an alert has been dismissed and you update the alert rule, the alert will continue to stay dismissed.
+
Add a Reason, Requestor, and Approver for the automatic dismissal and click *Next*.

+
By default, all alerts triggered by the alert rule display on the *Alerts* page. If you xref:../configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud.adoc#id24911ff9-c9ec-4503-bb3a-6cfce792a70d[Configure External Integrations on Prisma Cloud], you can also send Prisma Cloud alerts triggered by this alert rule to third-party tools. For example, you can xref:send-prisma-cloud-alert-notifications-to-third-party-tools.adoc#id84f16f30-a2d0-44b7-85b2-4beaaef2f5bc[] or xref:send-prisma-cloud-alert-notifications-to-third-party-tools.adoc#id728ba82c-c17b-4e3e-baf2-131e292ec074[]. For Prisma Cloud Data Security, see xref:../prisma-cloud-data-security/monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/data-policies.adoc#ida32d859b-724d-416f-9000-74fa6de13688[]. In addition, you can configure the alert rule to xref:send-prisma-cloud-alert-notifications-to-third-party-tools.adoc#id14fc2c3e-ce2a-4ff2-acb5-af764e49a838[].
+
If you want to delay the alert notifications for Config alerts, you can configure the Prisma Cloud to *Trigger notification for config alert only after the alert is open for* a specific number of minutes.
+
[NOTE]
====
The alert notifications delay that you configure for Config alerts does not affect the timing of any remediation that might occur with this alert.
====

. (tt:[Optional]) *Configure Notifications* to enable alert notifications for all states.
+
If you want to receive external notifications for when an existing alert status has changed, you can configure Prisma Cloud to generate alerts when an existing alert is *Dismissed*, *Snoozed*, or *Ignored*. The options for configuring the notification settings:
+
* *Notify when alert is*—Select this dialog box to configure the alert states; the *Open* state is enabled by default. After selecting the alert states, select the integration services that you want to generate alerts for.
* *Trigger notification for config alert only after the alert is open for*—Specify the length of time (in minutes) for which you want to wait before sending notifications after an alert is generated. This value does not apply for recurring (or scheduled) notifications.
+
[NOTE]
====
The ability to send notifications for all states is limited GA. If you’re interested, contact Prisma Cloud Customer Support to enable this feature on your tenant. No alerts will be generated for the Jira and Cortex XSOAR integrations.
