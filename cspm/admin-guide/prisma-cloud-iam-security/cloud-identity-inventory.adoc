== Cloud Identity Inventory

Prisma Cloud surfaces detailed information on IAM access in your cloud environment to give you greater visibility into over-privileged AWS Groups and Roles. You can then take action to enforce least privileged access by removing unused privileges and restricting permissions within existing AWS Groups and Roles.

=== IAM Details View

Select *Inventory > Assets* and click on any asset to view the Assets sidecar. Choose *IAM Details* from the top navigation bar to view the following IAM information:

=== Remediate Over Privileged Access

You also have the option to right-size permissions for AWS Groups and Roles. The *Suggest Least Privilege Access* wizard helps you remediate overly permissive access by helping you:

* Create a new policy for a Group or Role that includes all the permissions required by its members.
* Repurpose existing policies that already contain the minnimum required permissions for any given Group or Role. 

Follow the steps below to use the *Suggest Least Privilege Access* wizard:

[.procedure]
. Navigate to *Inventory > Assets* and click on any asset to view the Assets sidecar.
. Choose the *IAM Details View* and select *Suggest Least Privilege Access* from the top navigation bar. 
. The *Suggest Least Privilege Access* wizard allows you to set the period of time after which a permission will be considered be “unused”, for a particular asset. Move the slider to any defined time limit of your choice. By default, the slider is set at 90 days and options ranging 1 day to 2 years are available. Last access days are calculated from the day the IAM is enabled in your environment.
. Next, create a customized IAM policy in your preferred output format:
.. Select *Create New AWS Policy* to generate a file with code to create a new Custom policy, including all used permissions. Supported policy types include Managed, Custom, and Inline. The following output formats are avaiable: 
*JSON
*Terraform
*Cloud Formation 
.. Select *Reuse Existing AWS Policy* to repurpose an existing Managed or Custom policy. Choose from one of the following output options:
* Terraform file with existing minimum required permissions.
* List of policies with the appropriate minimum permissions.
