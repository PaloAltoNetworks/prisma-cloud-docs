== Enable IAM Security

// Activate the IAM Security module in Prismaâ„¢ Cloud so that you have Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) functionality.

Enabling IAM Security in Prisma Cloud is easy and can be done in only a couple of steps.

[.procedure]
. Log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console.
+
See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/access-prisma-cloud.html[Access Prisma Cloud].

. Onboard your AWS, Azure, or GCP accounts where you manage IAM to ensure Prisma Cloud can ingest your IAM data.  In the case of Azure, this must be an Azure Active Directory tenant.
+
** If you are onboarding relevant cloud accounts to Prisma Cloud now, follow appropriate Cloud Account onboarding instructions.
*** AWS: Choose your relevant AWS onboarding option under xref:../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/onboard-your-aws-account.adoc#idb92a9405-31ce-42f3-9ed0-19ef216544fb[Onboard Your AWS Account].

*** Azure: Choose your relevant Azure Active Directory tenant option under xref:../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/onboard-your-azure-account.adoc#id51ddadea-1bfb-4571-8430-91a1f54673d2[Onboard Your Azure Account].  Tenant onboarding is required in this case because IAM is managed in Azure Active Directory tenants in Azure. 
*** GCP: Choose your relevant GCP onboarding option under xref:../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-gcp-account.adoc#id9083908f-b803-4b6d-9ec2-3783cff2180f[Onboard Your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account].

** If you had previously onboarded your cloud accounts, you may need to verify that you have granted the Prisma Cloud app/service account the additional permissions required for IAM Security.
+
*** AWS: no additional permissions are required. The Terraform templates you used to onboard your cloud account include the required permissions.

*** Azure: xref:../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/update-azure-application-permissions.adoc#idd4a9fb0b-59df-473b-8547-789be4c18ec5[Update Azure Application Permissions].

*** GCP: xref:#id0cd5f416-924c-4d62-8fad-67fb847dbdb1[Grant permissions for Ingesting Google Workspace Groups].
+
[NOTE]
====
Verify that you have onboarded with AWS CloudTrail so that you receive excessive permissions alerts.

. Enable the IAM Security module.
+
.. Select *Subscription* to see the options you have available on your Prisma Cloud tenant.

.. Click *Learn More* under the IAM Security icon.
+

+ 
You can try the IAM Security module for free for 30-days to test out all of the features such as the IAM query, SSO integration, and out-of-the-box IAM policies.

.. Verify that your installation was successful.
+

. Investigate with RQL.
+
After the IAM Security module has been successfully activated, RQL will be extended to include the userinput:[iam] query. Enter the query in the *Investigate* tab to confirm that the *iam* module has been enabled:
+
userinput:[config from iam where source.cloud.service.name = 'iam' and source.cloud.resource.type = 'user' and source.cloud.resource.name = 'my-user']
+
After the RQL has been rendered successfully, a green check mark will appear in the search field.
+

Read the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/iam-query.html[documentation] for more information on how to use the userinput:[iam] query.

=== Grant permissions for Ingesting Google Workspace Groups

To grant the Prisma Cloud Service Account permissions to ingest data on groups from Google Workspace (GSuite), you must have administrator access to Google Workspace (GSuite). The permissions required for ingesting data on groups is either the predefined role *Group Reader*, or a custom role with *groups:read* permission (https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/roles[https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/roles]).

[.procedure]
. Log in to https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/roles/26396648347271175[Workspace].

. Create a new custom role or use the predefined *Group Reader* role.
