== Enable IAM Security

// Activate the IAM Security module in Prisma™ Cloud so that you have Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) functionality.

You can enable the IAM Security module on Prisma Cloud in a couple of clicks, because it requires the same permissions you provided when onboarding your AWS account, GCP account, or Azure subscription on Prisma Cloud. It does not require new permissions to get all of the effective permissions calculations and the write events.

[.procedure]
. Log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console.
+
See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/access-prisma-cloud.html[Access Prisma Cloud].

. Onboard your AWS, Azure, or GCP account on Prisma Cloud.
+
** See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/add-aws-cloud-account-to-prisma-cloud.html[Add an AWS Account on Prisma Cloud], xref:../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/onboard-your-azure-account.adoc#id51ddadea-1bfb-4571-8430-91a1f54673d2[Onboard Your Azure Account], or onboard-your-gcp-account.xml[Onboard Your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account] for details.

** Verify that you have granted the Prisma Cloud app/service account the additional permissions required for IAM Security.
+
*** AWS—no additional permissions are required. The Terraform templates you used to onboard your cloud account include the required permissions.

*** Azure—xref:../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/update-azure-application-permissions.adoc#idd4a9fb0b-59df-473b-8547-789be4c18ec5[Update Azure Application Permissions].

*** GCP—xref:#id0cd5f416-924c-4d62-8fad-67fb847dbdb1[Grant permissions for Ingesting Google Workspace Groups].
+
[NOTE]
====
Verify that you have onboarded with AWS CloudTrail so that you receive excessive permissions alerts.

. Investigate with RQL.
+
After the IAM Security module has been successfully activated, RQL will be extended to include the userinput:[iam] query. Enter the query in the *Investigate* tab to confirm that the *iam* module has been enabled:
+
userinput:[config from iam where source.cloud.service.name = 'iam' and source.cloud.resource.type = 'user' and source.cloud.resource.name = 'my-user']
+
After the RQL has been rendered successfully, a green check mark will appear in the search field.

=== Grant permissions for Ingesting Google Workspace Groups

To grant the Prisma Cloud Service Account permissions to ingest data on groups from Google Workspace (GSuite), you must have administrator access to Google Workspace (GSuite). The permissions required for ingesting data on groups is either the predefined role *Group Reader*, or a custom role with *groups:read* permission (https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/roles[https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/roles]).

[.procedure]
. Log in to https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/roles/26396648347271175[Workspace].

. Create a new custom role or use the predefined *Group Reader* role.
