== Integrate Prisma Cloud with IdP Services

Prisma Cloud integrates with the identity providers (IdP) *Okta* and *Azure Active Directory* (AD) to ingest single sign-on (SSO) data for the effective permissions calculation in the IAM Security module. You can use the enhanced RQL to query for identity management issues, for example whether an IdP user created an IAM user. This answer highlights potential back doors into your cloud environment that helps you mitigate security breaches.
