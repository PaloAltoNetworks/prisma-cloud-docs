== Remediate Alerts for IAM Security

// Manually remediate your IAM security misconfigurations by running CLI commands or automatically remediate overly permissive users with a custom python script.

The IAM security module provides two options for remediating alerts so that you can enforce the principle of least privilege across your AWS, Azure, and GCP environments. You can manually remediate the alerts by copying the AWS, Azure, or GCP CLI commands and then run t hem in your cloud environment or you can configure a custom python script to automate the remediation steps.

[NOTE]
====
IAM automatic remediation is different from Prisma Cloud automatic remediation. The IAM module does not support the option to enable automatic remediation. Instead, xref:../manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/create-an-alert-rule.adoc#idd1af59f7-792f-42bf-9d63-12d29ca7a950[Create an Alert Rule for Run-Time Checks] follow the instructions for configuring a custom p ython script on xref:#id6591319e-c53c-4df5-826f-7fc1b09f0464[Configure and Run AWS IAM Remediation Script] or xref:#idb32d1fc5-f705-438f-a798-e9d1a791d96e[Configure and Run Azure IAM Remediation Script] to manage automatic remediation for IAM alert rules using the messaging queuing service on the respective CSP.

=== Manually Remediate IAM Security Alerts

The following steps shows how you can manually remediate alerts in AWS. You can follow similar steps in Azure and GCP.

[.procedure]
. View the existing alerts.
+
To view all of the policies that triggered an alert select menu:Alerts[Overview.]

. Click *Add Filter* (image:add-filter-icon.PNG[scale=60]) and select menu:Policy{sp}Type[IAM].
+
image::iam-security-policy-type.png[scale=30]

. Select the violating policy that you want to remediate.
+
On Prisma Cloud, policies that you can remediate are indicated by the image:remediable-icon.png[scale=50] icon.
+
image::iam-security-policy-alert.png[scale=30]

. Investigate the policy violations.
+
In this example we see all the violating resources for this Okta user. Prisma Cloud provides us hints on why the alert was generated, which in this case was a result of an Okta user being able to create another IAM user—this could lead to a potential back door because even if the original Okta user is deleted, they can still log in through the second user. Prisma Cloud also provides recommended steps on how to resolve the policy violation.
+
image::iam-security-alert-violating-policy.png[scale=30]
+
After a policy violation is triggered, it is sent to the SQS queue.
+
image::send-and-receive-messages-1-alert.png[scale=25]
+
In this example the SQS queue shows 1 message which is the alert that was triggered.

. Get the remediation steps.
+
Under the *OPTIONS* column, click *Remediate*.
+
image::iam-security-remediate-button.png[scale=50]

.. Copy the CLI commands.
+
After you click *Remediate* the CLI commands appears in a popup window.
+
image::iam-security-cli-commands.png[scale=30]

.. Run the CLI commands on your AWS account. In case of your GCP account, before you run the CLI command see xref:#id54a76b5a-cc02-4394-b2d8-c0a64b17bc3e[Set up Remediation for GCP IAM Alerts].
+
After you executed the CLI commands you will have completed the remediation process and the excess privileges will be revoked. The SQS queue will now show 0 messages.

=== Set up Automatic Remediation for AWS IAM Alerts

Automate the remediation steps for your AWS IAM alerts with the help of a custom python script which receives an alert via the AWS SQS queue, extracts the alert ID and uses it to call the IAM remediation API, and runs the commands which are provided by the API response.

[#id2cecf98a-db8f-4a61-9eaf-12171397bd4f]
==== Review Prerequisites for AWS Remediation Script

Complete the following prerequisites so that you can set up everything you need to successfully run the python script. This includes the Prisma Cloud integrations, APIs, and python libraries.

* Integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon SQS—This is an AWS service that allows you to send, store, and receive messages between AWS and Prisma Cloud. Follow the steps to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/send-prisma-cloud-alert-notifications-to-third-party-tools.html#idcda01586-a091-497d-87b5-03f514c70b08_id84f16f30-a2d0-44b7-85b2-4beaaef2f5bc[integrate Prisma Cloud with SQS].

* Create https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/create-an-alert-rule[alert rules] and set up https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/send-prisma-cloud-alert-notifications-to-third-party-tools.html[alert notifications]to Amazon SQS. All alerts triggered for the IAM policy you selected will be sent to the SQS queue.

. Install the 3rd party libraries.
+
This script uses a total of five python libraries. Three of the libraries: varname:[json], varname:[os], and varname:[subprocess] are part of the python core which allows you to import them into your programs after you install python. The other two libraries are varname:[boto3] and varname:[requests] which are 3rd party libraries—or—libraries that you have to install before running the script. Python has a default package downloader called varname:[pip], which can install 3rd party libraries and frameworks via the command line.

.. Install varname:[boto3].
+
From the command line (Windows) or terminal (Linux/MacOS) type the following command:
+
pip install boto3
+
[NOTE]
====
This is the AWS SDK for python that allows you to create, configure, and manage AWS services such as SQS.
====

.. Install varname:[requests].
+
From the command line (Windows) or terminal (Linux/MacOS) type the following command:
+
pip install requests
+
[NOTE]
====
requests is a 3rd party library for making simple HTTP requests.
====

. Edit the environment variables.
+
These are mandatory variables to specify in the python script to run the commands provided by the API response and to customize the settings.
+
tt:[Optional (mac/linux only)]—Use the export command to set your environment variables.
+
If you’re not familiar with python and don’t want to edit the script then you can use the varname:[export] command to set the environment variables. Here’s the syntax for doing so:
+
* screen:[% export API_ENDPOINT=api_tenant]
* screen:[% export YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=123456789]
* screen:[% export SQS_QUEUE_NAME=your_sqs_queue_name ]
* screen:[% export YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=123456789]
* screen:[% export AUTH_KEY=your_jwt_token]
* screen:[% python script.py]
+
The following instructions can be executed on any operating system that has python installed. For example, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
+
[cols="50%a,50%a"]

.. tt:[Edit varname:[DEBUG\]].
+
varname:[DEBUG] is enabled or set to varname:[True] by default. To disable logs, update the code snippet as follow:
+
----
if os.environ['DEBUG'] = False:
----

.. Edit YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER.
+
Replace varname:[YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER] with the 12-digit account ID. The portion of the script to modify is:
+
----
account_number_to_profile = {    'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_1': 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_1',    'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_2': 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_2'}

* screen:[% export SB_QUEUE_KEY=your_sb_queue_key]
* screen:[% export SB_QUEUE_KEY_NAME=your_sb_queue_key_name]
* screen:[% export SB_QUEUE_NAME_SPACE=your_sb_queue_name_space]
* screen:[% export API_ENDPOINT=api_tenant]
* screen:[% export AUTH_KEY=your_jwt_token]
+
The following instructions can be executed on any operating system that has python installed. For example, Windows, macOS, and Linux.+
+
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
|VALUE


|varname:[SB_QUEUE_KEY]
|A string that represents the Service Bus queue key value.

+++<draft-comment>is this the Azure queue key value?</draft-comment>+++


|varname:[SB_QUEUE_KEY_NAME]
|A string that represents your Service Bus key name.


|varname:[SB_QUEUE_NAME_SPACE]
|A string that represents your Service Bus namespace.


|varname:[API_ENDPOINT]
|Your Prisma Cloud API subdomain. For example, if your tenant is `\https://api.prismacloud.io` , then the varname:[API_ENDPOINT] will be api.


|varname:[AUTH_KEY]
|Your JWT authentication token string (x-redlock-auth). See the https://pan.dev/api/cloud[api reference] for more details.

=== Set up Remediation for GCP IAM Alerts

Prisma Cloud leverages the https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview[Deny Policies] feature on GCP to remediate risky permissions to ensure a safe rollout in case you decide to revert the remediated risky permissions. Make sure you have done all the necessary https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-access#before-you-begin[configurations] in your GCP environment to use *Deny Policies*.

[NOTE]
====
* GCP *Deny Policies* feature does not yet support all https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-permissions-support[permissions] due to which some of the alerts can be partially remediable or not remediable. The list of permissions in Prisma Cloud IAM security will be updated as per their availability in GCP.

* *Deny Policies* is a public Beta release on GCP, so *remediation* will also be a Beta release on Prisma Cloud.
====

[.procedure]
. *Add Filter* (image:add-filter-icon.PNG[scale=60]) and select menu:Policy{sp}Type[IAM] and menu:Cloud{sp}Type[GCP].

. Select the violating policy that you want to remediate.

. Investigate the policy violations.

. Get the remediation steps.
+
Under the *OPTIONS* column, click *Remediate*.
+
.. Copy the CLI commands.
+
After you click *Remediate* the CLI commands appears in a popup window.
+

.. Run the CLI commands on your GCP account. Before you run the CLI command, see https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview[Deny Policies].
+
After you execute the CLI commands, the remediation process is complete and the excess privileges will be revoked.
