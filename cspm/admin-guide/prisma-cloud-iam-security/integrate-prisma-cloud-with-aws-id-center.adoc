== Integrate Prisma Cloud with AWS IAM Identity Center 

To provide effective permissions calculation in the IAM Security module, Prisma Cloud integrates with the Identity Provider (IdP) service, AWS IAM Identity Center, to ingest Single Sign-On (SSO) data. Complete this integration to gain better visibility into the entities accessing your cloud resources, by using the IAM query to list effective permissions of AWS IAM Identity Center users across your cloud accounts.

Prisma Cloud requires the following additional permissions to support AWS IAM Identity Center integration:

* screen:[sso:ListInstances]
* screen:[sso:ListPermissionSets]
* screen:[sso:ListAccountForProvisionedPermissionSet]
* screen:[sso:ListAccountAssignments]
* screen:[sso:DescribePermissionSets]
* screen:[identitystore:ListUsers]
* screen:[identitystore:ListGroupMemberships]
* screen:[identitystore:ListGroups]

If you are using a CloudFormation template for AWS account onboarding no additional action is required. The required permissions are part of the CloudFormation onboarding template.
