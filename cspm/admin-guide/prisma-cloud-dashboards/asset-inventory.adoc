== Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory

Use the Asset Inventory dashboard to see up-to-date information on all cloud resources that you are using Prisma Cloud to monitor and secure.

On the Asset Inventory (on the "Inventory > Assets"), the Asset Trend visualization displays 90-day trend information at all times, and the  Asset History provides a historical view into the assets within the inventory.

Each row displays the service name with details on the cloud type, assets with alerts, assets with vulnerabilities, and the percentage of resources that pass policy checks to which you want to adhere. The links in each column help you explore and gain the additional context you may need to take action. The *Data as of:* value indicates the freshness of the snapshot of the data.

The *Assets with Alerts* column displays the total number of assets by alert severity for a specified group of assets and the *Assets with Vulnerabilities* column displays the total number of assets by vulnerability severity for a specified group of assets. You can filter to view the inventory based on Date, Cloud Type, Azure Resource Group, Compliance Requirement, Compliance Standard, Resource Type, Compliance Section, Account Group, Cloud Account, Cloud Region, Alert Severity, and Vulnerability Severity.

You can set the *Date* filter to *Most Recent* to view the most recent state of the inventory or choose *Custom* for any date within the last 90 days.

* *Asset Explorer*: You can view the Asset Explorer by selecting a filterable subset of assets from the Asset Inventory. You can then select an asset from the Explorer view to access the Asset Detail view. Vulnerability Severity displays assets with known software vulnerabilities of a specific severity while Alert Severity displays assets with open alerts of a specific severity. You can use the Column Picker to show or hide columns.

* *Asset Detail View*: The Asset Detail View provides you with a focused view of the following asset details:
+
* *Overview*: Is the default tab and includes primary asset attributes. The "You are viewing the most recent data about this asset" text indicates that this is the most recent data for the asset regardless of the data roll-up time and it may be more up to date than the latest snapshot.

* *Audit Trail*: Includes discovery, configuration changes, and alert and vulnerability events.

* *Alerts*: Displays open alerts for the asset.

* *Findings*: Displays findings which are security issues discovered on an asset, including vulnerabilities. If you have vulnerability information for the asset from Prisma Cloud and third-party sources, the findings from Prisma Cloud are prioritized and displayed.

* *IAM Details*: Displays https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/cloud-identity-inventory[IAM access] information for assets. 

* *Relationships*: Displays tabular representation of related assets.

* *Objects*: Displays data objects within applicable assets.

+++<draft-comment - this was from the legacy invemtory section>
//[NOTE]
//====
//You may see more failed resources on the Compliance Dashboard compared to the Asset Inventory. This is because the Asset Inventory only counts assets that belong to your cloud account, and the Compliance Dashboard includes foreign entities such as SSO or Federated Users that are not resources ingested directly from the monitored cloud accounts.
