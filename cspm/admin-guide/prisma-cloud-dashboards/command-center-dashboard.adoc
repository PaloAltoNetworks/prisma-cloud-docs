== Command Center Dashboard
Learn more about quickly assessing the most urgent activity taking place across your cloud environments.

The Command Center dashboard provides you with a unified view of the top cloud security incidents and risks uncovered across the assets monitored by Prisma™ Cloud. It provides security teams with an at a glance picture of the highest priority incidents and risks that require attention across the following attack vectors:

* Incidents

* Misconfigurations

* Exposures

* Identity Risks

* Data Risks



The Command Center dashboard is only available to users with a System Admin role.

=== Total Urgent Alerts

The *Total Urgent Alerts* bar provides a tally of alerts grouped by Incidents, Misconfigurations, Exposures, Identity, and Data Risks. The *Filter* controls above the Alerts bar allow you to narrow your investigation to a specific *Time Range* or *Account Group*. You can select multiple account groups at once to view data from multiple account sources. Filter data retrieved is updated across all the alert visualizations on the dashboard. The revert icon on the right above the Total Urgent Alerts bar allows you to revert back to default filter settings.

=== Alerts Actions

Each alerts visualization allows you to further drill down and view the source of the alert by the policy name or the asset it originated from:

The Incidents widget above for instance, provides three visualizations of urgent alert activity:

* *Urgent Incidents*: Provides a donut chart visualization of critical, high, medium, or low severity Incidents. Select any alert for an in depth look at anomalies, network and workload incidents and audit events.

* *Top Incidents by Policy*: Lists the top five policies that triggered an alert. Select a policy or an alert total for a detailed view of policy coverage incidents. You can also investigate alerts within individual policies on the xref:../manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/view-respond-to-prisma-cloud-alerts.adoc#id7666bedc-a6f4-45cf-9de4-2aba2c3a65a7[] page.

* *Top Incidents by Asset*: Lists top five incidents by asset name, number of alerts, service, and account name. See more details on alerts generated in a specific asset on the xref:assets-policies-and-compliance-on-prisma-cloud.adoc#ide4fd2e50-e885-45e5-97cc-e9e620e2a31f[] page.

=== Generate Reports

You can also share Command Center reports with stakeholders to keep them abreast of the security and compliance status of your cloud assets. Select the *Generate Report* button to create and download a report. This generates the *Top Cloud Risks and Incidents Report* for that specific time range and selected account group(s).

The generated report captures the top five alerts listed under each widget and also includes an *Executive Summary* as shown above, capturing the top five urgent incidents across your organizations’ cloud assets.
