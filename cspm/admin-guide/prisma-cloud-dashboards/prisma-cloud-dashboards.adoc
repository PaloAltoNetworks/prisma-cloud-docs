== Prisma Cloud Dashboards

Use the Prisma Cloud dashboards to monitor the health and security posture of your cloud infrastructure.

The interactive Asset Inventory and SecOps dashboards give you visibility into the health and security posture of your cloud infrastructure. The dashboards provide a summarized and graphical view of all your Prisma Cloud cloud accounts and resources, and you can use the predefined or custom time range to view current trends or historical data.
