Your Azure storage account stores the flow logs that are required for Prisma Cloud to monitor and analyze network traffic. When Prisma Cloud ingests the data in these logs, you can interact with the information in Prisma Cloud. For example, you can run queries against the data, visualize network topology, and investigate traffic flows between two instances. You can also apply network policies to this traffic.
