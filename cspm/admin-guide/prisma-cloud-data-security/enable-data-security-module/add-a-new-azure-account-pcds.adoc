.. Select the *Mode*.
+
Decide whether to enable permissions to only *Monitor* (read-only access) or to *Monitor and Protect* (read-write access) the resources in your cloud account. Your selection determines which Terraform template is used to automate the process of creating the custom role required for Prisma Cloud.

.. Follow the instructions to get your *Directory (Tenant) ID* and *Subscription ID* from your Azure portal, enter it in the Prisma Cloud UI, and click *Next*.
+
Prisma Cloud requires your Azure *Subscription ID* to identify your Azure cloud account and retrieve the storage account and key vault information and your *Directory (Tenant) ID* to identify your tenant.

If Prisma Cloud is unable to retrieve the logs, the message indicates what failed. See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/troubleshoot-azure-account-onboarding.html#id6b7e6e40-9ce7-43d8-b5b5-1dcc607d8e9b[Troubleshoot Azure Account Onboarding] to resolve the issue.

.. *Configure Scan* to scan all your resources or you can choose to customize what you want to scan.
+
* When you select *Scan All Resources*, Prisma Cloud will forward scan and backward scan all eligible objects in the resources for public exposure, sensitive data, and malware. The forward scan inspects any new or modified objects, and the backward scan is retrospective, which means that it inspects objects that exist in the resource. The size and number of objects that you want to scan within your resource will determine how many Prisma Cloud credits are used for Data Security.

* When you select *Custom Scan Resources*, Prisma Cloud will forward scan and/or backward scan eligible objects in selected resources.
+
image::add-azure-subs-pcds-9.png[scale=40]

.. After data security is successfully configured, the *Status* page displays a success message.
+

[NOTE]
====
If it takes Azure some time to grant permission to Prisma Cloud, you will see the *Data Security is not successfully configured* message. You can check the status after some time. If there are permission errors, see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/troubleshoot-data-security-errors[Troubleshoot Data Security Errors] to resolve the error.
