== Enable Data Security for AWS Account

Begin here if you want to add your AWS cloud account on Prisma Cloud and start scanning the files stored in your S3 buckets.

[.procedure]
. xref:../../connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/onboard-aws-account.adoc[Onboard Your AWS Account].

. Click the *Eye* (View Cloud Account) icon next to the AWS account for which you want to enable Data Security.

. Click *Configure* under Data Security.

. Select *Data Security* under *Security Capabilities and Permissions*.
+
Data policies on Prisma Cloud do not support automatic remediation; therefore, if you configure Data Security on an AWS account with Remediation enabled you must manually fix issues to address alerts generated from data policies.
+

. Click *Next*.

. [[id82a563a3-ea83-444d-a6ab-f1f8b5e116d8]]Allow Prisma Cloud to access your bucket.
+
If you have configured bucket policy to restrict access, make sure to complete the following tasks on the AWS Management Console:

.. Copy the Prisma Cloud Role ARN that you added to enable Data Security on Prisma Cloud above.

.. Edit your bucket policy to include the Prisma Cloud Role ARN.
+
The following snippet is an example: Consider a bucket policy that denies access to userinput:[monitored-bucket] when requesting userinput:[s3:GetObject] API.
+
[userinput]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::monitored-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::monitored-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
In order for PrismaCloud to get access to the objects in userinput:[monitored-bucket] , attach a negation condition to the bucket policy to allow userinput:[PrismaCloudReadOnlyRoleWithDLP] to access the bucket.
+
[userinput]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::monitored-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::monitored-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "ArnNotEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": [
            "arn:aws:iam::<accountID>:role/<PrismaCloudReadOnlyRoleWithDLP>"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
+
Without these permissions, Prisma Cloud is denied access to S3 buckets with restricted bucket policies (HTTP 403 error).

. *Configure Account*.
+
image::aws-edit-ds-2.png[scale=30]

* *Download IAM Role CFT* and follow the *Steps* listed.

. Click *Next*.

. *Configure Data Security*.
+
image::aws-edit-ds-3.png[scale=30]
+
Choose to scan all your resources or you can choose to customize what you want to scan.
+
* When you select Scan All, Prisma Cloud will Forward scan and Backward scan all eligible objects. The forward scan inspects any new or modified files, and the backward scan is retrospective, which means that it inspects files that exist in the storage bucket. The xref:../monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/supported-file-extensions.adoc#supported-file-extensions[] of files that you want to scan within your storage bucket will determine how many Prisma Cloud credits are used for Data Security.

* When you select Custom Scan, Prisma Cloud will Forward scan and/or Backward scan eligible objects in selected resources.

. Click *Next*.

. *Define Forward Scan*.
+
image::aws-edit-ds-4.png[scale=30]
+
You can choose to *Add New* or *Select existing* CloudTrail, SNS Topic, or Buckets for Log Files. The consumption of Prisma Cloud license credits depends on the file size in the selected objects and whether you enable forward and backward scans.
+
[NOTE]
====
CloudTrail buckets are not scanned. You can choose buckets with objects containing ELB access logs, S3 access logs, and VPC flow logs for scanning.
====

. Click *Next*.

. *Configure Forward Scan*.
+
.. *Download Template* locally. The template is a .zip file that contains shell script, CFTs, and configuration files.

.. Login to your Amazon CloudShell account, upload the .zip file you downloaded in the above step, and run the following command that will create a Bucket, SNS Topic, and CloudTrail:
+
----
sh pcds_forward_scan_setup.sh -f config.txt
----

.. Wait for the CREATE_COMPLETE status.
+
image::aws-onboard-new-4.png[scale=30]

.. Once the above command runs successfully in AWS, click *Validate Setup* on Prisma Cloud.
+
image::aws-edit-ds-5.png[scale=30]

.. Irrespective of whether the script gets validated or not you can continue to onboard and configure data security for your AWS account. If validation fails, see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/troubleshoot-data-security-errors[Troubleshoot Data Security Errors] and set up AWS CloudTrail and SNS manually to resolve it.

. Click *Next*.

. (tt:[Optional]) Follow this step only if the objects inside your S3 buckets are encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMK).
+
The step varies depending on whether the CMK is located within the same AWS account or a different one:
+
* When the CMK is in the same AWS account that you’re onboarding, the Prisma Cloud role needs additional permissions to access the key. Add the following statement to the Prisma Cloud role and update the resources array with all the CMK ARNs:
+
[userinput]
----
{
            "Sid": "AllowPrismaCloudToAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:ap-south-123456789101:key/3269f3d0-1820-407f-b67e-73acdd9243f4"]
}
----

* When the CMK is in a different AWS account than the one that you’re onboarding, you need to first add the following policy statement to all the CMKs that are used for encryption and update the *Principal AWS* field with the Prisma Cloud ARN:
+
[userinput]
----
{
            "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::726893731529:role/PrismaCloudReadOnlyRoleWithDLP"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
}
----
+
PrismaCloudReadOnlyRoleWithDLP refers to the Prisma Cloud Role ARN that you added to enable Data Security on Prisma Cloud. This role needs additional permissions to access the key. Add the following statement to the Prisma Cloud role and update the resources array with all the CMK ARNs:
+
[userinput]
----
{
            "Sid": "AllowPrismaCloudToAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:ap-south-123456789101:key/3269f3d0-1820-407f-b67e-73acdd9243f4"]
