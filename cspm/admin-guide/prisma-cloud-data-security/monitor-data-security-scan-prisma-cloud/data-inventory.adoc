== Data Inventory
The new Data Inventory ( menu:Inventory[Data]) provides information on the number of S3 storage buckets being monitored and summary data cards that provide status on how objects are exposed—public, sensitive, or malware, along with a detailed inventory view of objects across accounts, account groups, buckets and regions. It also provides a number of filters such as Time Range, Bucket Name, Bucket Exposure, Object Profile, Object Pattern to find the specific buckets or objects they are interested in.
