== Supported File Sizes and Typesâ€”Prisma Cloud Data Security

*Supported File Sizes*

* For *data* classification scanning:

** The size of .avro, .csv, .json, .ORC, .parquet, .tsv, .txt, .zip, .csv.gz, .json.gz, .tsv.gz, and .txt.gz files must be less than 2.5GB.

** For all other supported file types listed below, the uncompressed file size must be less than 20MB. For example, if the file size is more than 20MB, but was compressed to under 20MB, the file will not be successfully scanned.

* For *malware* scanning, the uncompressed file size must be less than 100MB. For example, if the file size is more than 100MB, but was compressed to under 100MB, the file will not be successfully scanned.

* For ML-based classification scanning, the file size must be less than 1MB.
