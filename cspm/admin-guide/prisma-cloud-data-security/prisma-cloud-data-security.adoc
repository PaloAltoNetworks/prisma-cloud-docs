== Prisma Cloud Data Security

The Data Security capabilities on Prisma Cloud enable you to discover and classify data stored in AWS S3 buckets and Azure Blob storage and protect accidental exposure, misuse, or sharing of sensitive data. To identify and detect confidential and sensitive data, Prisma Cloud Data Security integrates with Palo Alto Networks’ Enterprise DLP service and provides data classification that includes built-in data profiles with data patterns that match sensitive information such as PII, health care, financial information and Intellectual Property. In addition to protecting your confidential and sensitive data, your data is also protected against threats—known and unknown (zero-day) malware—using the Palo Alto Networks’ WildFire service.
