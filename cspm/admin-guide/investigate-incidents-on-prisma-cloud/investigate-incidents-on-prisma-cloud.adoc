== Investigate Incidents on Prisma Cloud

Learn how to use Prisma Cloud to investigate config, audit, and network incidents.

Prisma Cloud helps you visualize your entire cloud infrastructure and provides insights into security and compliance risks.

Prisma Cloud helps you connect the dots between configuration, user activity, and network traffic data, so that you have the context necessary to define appropriate policies and create alert rules.

To conduct such investigations, Prisma Cloud provides you with a proprietary query language called RQL that is similar to SQL.
