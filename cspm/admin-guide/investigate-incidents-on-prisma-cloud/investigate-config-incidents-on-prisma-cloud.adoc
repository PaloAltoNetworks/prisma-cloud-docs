== Investigate Config Incidents on Prisma Cloud
Use config queries to investigate configuration incidents so that you can identify misconfigurations and compliance violations.

Prisma Cloud ingests various services and associated configuration data from AWS, Azure, Alibaba, GCP, and OCI cloud services. You can retrieve resource information to identify resource misconfigurations, and detect policy violations that expose your business to undue risk and non-compliance to industry benchmarks. You can also view the audit trail for information on who created, modified, deleted resources on the cloud platform and when the change was made.

To investigate configuration issues ,you can use Config queries. You can enter your query in the Search bar and if the search expression is valid and complete, a green check mark displays along with your query results.

You can choose to save the search queries that you have created for investigating incidents in *My Saved Searches*. A saved search enables you to use the same query at a later time, instead of typing the query again, and it enables you to use the saved search to create a policy. See xref:#id6f435620-741b-4e4d-977f-cefb3422c174[Why are alerts generated from a policy different from the running the corresponding query (Saved Search) on the Investigate page?]

*Saved Searches* has list of search queries saved by any Prisma Cloud administrator.

Select a record to view additional details about Audit Trail or Host Findings in the Resource Explorer. The alerts are displayed when you select the red exclamation mark.

Hover over the configuration record to see the option to view the details of the resource configuration. You can also search directly within the JSON Resource configuration to easily find something that is part of the metadata ingested on Prisma Cloud, and speed up your investigation.

To analyze your configuration events offline, you can download the event search details in a CSV format, click *Download* on the right hand corner.

=== Why are alerts generated from a policy different from the running the corresponding query (Saved Search) on the Investigate page?
Prisma Cloud enables you to run a query on the Investigate page, and save the query as a saved search so that you can re-run the same search periodically. If you then use this saved search query as match criteria in a policy, the matched issues that trigger alerts can be different from the corresponding results for the same query on the Investigate page.

The reason for this difference in results is that the policy engine functions slightly differently from the Investigate page. To understand the differences you need to know the following:

*Criteria for creating a policy using a saved search*

* Saved search must be valid to create a policy. For Config queries ( userinput:[config from cloud.resource where] ), you may see the error *RQL invalid for policy creation*. This error indicates that the saves search RQL is not valid to create a policy.

* Currently, to create a policy the saved search must meet these guidelines:
+
** Does not have the userinput:[azure.resource.group] attribute

** when a userinput:[tag] attribute is within the json.rule, it does not have a resource list (reference with userinput:[{]  userinput:[}] )

** has either the userinput:[api.name] attribute or the userinput:[finding.type] attribute
+
*** when it has the userinput:[api.name] attribute, it includes a userinput:[json.rule] or the userinput:[group by] or userinput:[count] function

*** when has the userinput:[finding.type] attribute the specified values for the attribute do not contain userinput:[Prisma Cloud Alert] 
+
You can however, have the operator userinput:[Not Equal Prisma Cloud Alert] or userinput:[Not IN (Prisma Cloud Alert, boo, etc.)] .

*Criteria for updating a saved search used in a policy*

If you use a saved search to create a policy, you cannot update the following:

*  userinput:[cloud.type] 

*  userinput:[api.name] ** For non-join queries, userinput:[api.name] cannot be changed

** For join queries, the userinput:[api.name] in the clause used for userinput:[Show] cannot be changed.
+
Example query structure: userinput:[X; Y; Z; filterâ€¦; Show Y] 
+
userinput:[api.name] in Y *cannot* be updated (because X is used for Show)
+
userinput:[api.name] in X, Z *can* be updated

*Criteria for what is ignored or replaced when displaying results*

The values for the following attributes in a saved search are replaced by the scope you define in an alert rule:

*  userinput:[cloud.account] or userinput:[cloud.accountgroup] 

*  userinput:[cloud.region] 

*  userinput:[tag] (tag filter used within the userinput:[json.rule] will be ignored)

*  userinput:[cloud.type] , userinput:[cloud.service] 

* When userinput:[resource.status] is not specified in the query, both the Investigate page and the policy engine will return active userinput:**and** deleted resources.
+
However, the deleted resources for the policy engine includes only the _resources deleted since the last scan_ within the search scope, while the Investigate page scans all deleted resources available in the database. Specifically:
+
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Resource Status
|Policy Engine
|Investigate


|Active
|Resources that are running at the time of scan only
|Only resources that were running at the end time of the interval (creation time before time interval ends and deletion, if any, after the time interval).


|Deleted
|Resources deleted since the last scan only
|Only resources that were deleted during the specified time interval (deletion time within the interval).


|Not Specified
|Running resources and resources deleted since the last scan
|Any resources that existed during the specified time interval.

|===


*JOIN queries*

* For Investigate queries, cross-account join will be applied by default.
+
For policy engine, all queries are run on a specific account, which means JOIN will be done only within one account at a time.
