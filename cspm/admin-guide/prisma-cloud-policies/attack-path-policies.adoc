== Attack Path Policies

The true security risk of an application or infrastructure requires a complete assessment and correlation of a broad set of security signals. For example, if a virtual machine or an application is vulnerable to CVE-1234 that is network exploitable, is internet exposed, and has overly permissive IAM access to sensitive data, then this combination presents a relatively critical or high risk compared to an instance that contains the same vulnerability but is not internet exposed. 

Prisma Cloud provides Attack Path analysis and visualization, which is an automated process that identifies exposed or vulnerable infrastructure assets, applications, or data by correlating multiple security signals. It helps you identify attack paths and presents them in a graph view, offering valuable security context to protect against high-risk threats, which often requires you to take immediate action. 

The *Attack Path* policies are OOTB policies, which identify the confluence of issues that increase the likelihood of a security breach and are based on relationships such as, overly permissive identities, permissions, network exposure, infrastructure misconfiguration, and vulnerabilities that would enable an attacker to target an application. The Attack Path policies are enabled by default and are also part of the default alert rule based on the _prisma_cloud_ policy label.

To view the Attack Path policies, navigate to the *Policies* page and filter by Policy Type *Attack Path*. Verify that the listed policies are in the enabled state. If they are disabled, toggle the *Status* button to enable each policy before you create an Alert Rule.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the Attack Path policies require the IAM security (CIEM) module to be enabled. If you have not enabled it previously, you can use the 30-day trial by clicking the Subscription panel next to your username in the lower left corner of the Prisma Cloud console.

Before you create an Alert Rule for *Attack Path* policies, navigate to Settings > Enterprise Settings > Auto-Enable Default Policies and verify that you have selected *Critical* and *High* severity checkboxes.

Navigate to Alerts > Overview and filter alerts by Policy Type *Attack Path* and click on *Alert ID* to view the evidence graph that displays the details in Graph (default) view.
