== Workload Protection Policies
//Learn how to use workload protection policies to detect hosts and containers with vulnerabilities.

Prisma Cloud includes system default policies for protecting hosts and containers from runtime incidents and for detecting vulnerabilities on these workloads. 

[.task]
[#enable-workload-policy]
=== Enable Workload Policies

By default, the workload protection policies are disabled. You can enable these policies and use them in an alert rule for viewing alerts on runtime incidents and vulnerabilities.

[.procedure]

These policies are assigned as Cloud Type *Any*, and cannot be cloned.

. Toggle the *Status* to enable the policies.
+
Click a policy to view the details. 
Each policy provides a read only view of the vulnerability management rules that power the protections. 
Use *Manage Rules*  to view the details on each rule on the *Compute* tab. You can use the system default rules or custom vulnerability https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/vuln_management_rules[rules].
