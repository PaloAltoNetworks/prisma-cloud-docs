== Enable Access to the Prisma Cloud Console
// List of NAT Gateway IP addresses for Prisma™ Cloud and the URLs/domains that you must add to an allow list.

So that Prisma Cloud can connect to your cloud environments for monitoring and you can log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console, you must allow the following IP addresses and hostnames that are used by different components which comprise the service.

* xref:#idcb6d3cd4-d1bf-450a-b0ec-41c23a4d4280[NAT Gateway IP Addresses for Prisma Cloud]

* xref:#id82dc870f-ce5b-45c9-a196-f4d069cf94a2[Prisma Cloud Administrative Console]




[#idcb6d3cd4-d1bf-450a-b0ec-41c23a4d4280]
=== NAT Gateway IP Addresses for Prisma Cloud
Prisma™ Cloud uses the following NAT gateway IP addresses. To ensure that you can access Prisma Cloud and the API for any integrations that you enabled between Prisma Cloud and your incidence response workflows, or your agentless deployment or the Prisma Cloud Defenders to communicate with the Prisma Cloud Compute Console, review the list and update the IP addresses in your allow lists. 

In the event of disruption due to a disaster, to help backup data in a timely manner, add the Disaster Recovery (DR) IP addresses to your allow lists.

To add these IP addresses to an allow list, you may need to work with your network security team. The configuration for where you set up the allow list is dependent on your network architecture and it could be your firewall, proxy, or the server itself.

* The Prisma Cloud URL indicates the region where your tenant is deployed. For example, your tenant is on app3 if your URL is https://app3.prismacloud.io/.

* On the "Compute > Manage > System > Utilities", find the region in the URL for *Path to Console*. Use that region to identify the destination IP address, which you must allow or add as trusted to access the Prisma Cloud Compute console. For example, if the URL is https://us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-xxxxxx, *us-west1* indicates your Compute console region.

Use the table below to review the IP addresses to allow: *Egress*-From Defenders to Console; *Ingress*-From Console in to your environment.

On app3, which is https://app3.prismacloud.io/ for example, will need an outbound security rule for the Egress IP address `34.82.51.12`.
Compute requires only an outbound rule to Console for Agentless and Defender deployments communications.
For sending alerts to your environment, you'd add an inbound security rule to the Ingress IP address `104.198.109.73`.

[NOTE]
====
To install Prisma Cloud Defenders in Kubernetes cluster, in addition to being able to connect to the Prisma Cloud Compute Console, the nodes in your cluster must be able to access the Prisma Cloud cloud registry at registry-auth.twistlock.com.
