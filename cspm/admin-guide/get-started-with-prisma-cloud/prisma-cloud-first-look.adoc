== Prisma Cloud—First Look
Get a high-level overview of Prisma™ Cloud.

When you xref:access-prisma-cloud.adoc#id3d308e0b-921e-4cac-b8fd-f5a48521aa03[Access Prisma Cloud], you first see the xref:../manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts.adoc#id37d27852-d3a6-41b6-9d3b-aed82c00825d[]. You can then use the following tabs to interact with the data and visualize the traffic flow and connection details to and from the different resources in your cloud deployment; review the default policy rules and compliance standards; and explore how the web interface is organized to help you and DevSecOps teams to monitor cloud resources.

* *Dashboard*—Review the overall state of the top assets and alerts across the assets monitored by Prisma Cloud.

* *Inventory*—Get a graphical view of the health cloud (security and compliance posture) of your assets deployed across multiple public cloud environments.

* *Investigate*—Identify security threats and vulnerabilities, create and save investigative queries, and analyze impacted resources.

* *Policies*—Configure policies to maintain compliance and security.

* *Compliance*—Monitor your cloud accounts against compliance standards (such as NIST, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, ISO 27001:2013), create custom policies, and generate reports for offline viewing.

* *Alerts*—View the list of discovered violations and anomalies, drill in to the details and look up remediation options, and create alert rules and notification templates.

* *Compute*—Deploy the Prisma Cloud Defender in hosts, containers, and serverless environments to identify vulnerabilities, detect anomalous behavior, and provide least privilege micro-segmentation and runtime defense across the entire application lifecycle from CICD to runtime. You can deploy Prisma Cloud Defenders on heterogeneous environments, including Windows, Linux, Kubernetes, OpenShift, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions, and more. Defenders can create IP table rules on the host to observe network traffic and to enforce both CNNF and CNAF firewall policies. For details see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute.html[Prisma Cloud Administrator’s Guide (Compute)] image:ext-link-icon-small.png[scale=100].

* *Code*—Continuously assess the security posture of code repositories and review the policy violations across the monitored environments. If you have enabled the Cloud Code Security module, use the Code page to find and fix or suppress security issues in code. For details see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security.html[Prisma Cloud Code Security Administrator’s Guide] image:ext-link-icon-small.png[scale=100].

* *Network Security*—Enforce identity-based network defense across hosts, containers, and Kubernetes, and gain visibility of network flows to identify application dependencies in a map. If you have enabled the Identity-Based Microsegmentation module, protected workloads are assigned cryptographic identities, which the workloads then use to mutually authenticate and authorize application communication requests. For details, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-microsegmentation.html[Prisma Cloud Microsegmentation Administrator’s Guide] image:ext-link-icon-small.png[scale=100]

* *Settings*—Add new cloud accounts and set up Prisma Cloud administrative users. You can also set up account groups, create users, associate roles and permissions, add external integrations including SAML integration (SSO), view audit logs, add trusted IP addresses, view license and usage reporting, and modify the browser session timeout.

* *Alarms*—Alarms notify you about system-level issues and errors related to external integrations and onboarded Cloud Accounts. When enabled, alarms are notifications about the system failures on Prisma Cloud and are not related to alerts.

* *Subscription*—Review the license status of your subscription and enable any add-on features that are available to you.

* *Adoption Advisor*—Get visibility into your adoption journey, and use the guided walkthroughs to unlock additional security features on Prisma Cloud.

* *Profile*—Maintain your profile, view the Prisma Cloud roles that you are allocated and switch across the roles, and change the UI display language.
