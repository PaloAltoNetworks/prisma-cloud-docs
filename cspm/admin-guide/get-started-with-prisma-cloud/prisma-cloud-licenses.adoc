== Prisma Cloud License Types
Learn about the Prisma™ Cloud licensing options and available subscriptions.

Prisma Cloud is available as a one-, two-, or three-year subscription in the following offerings:

* *Prisma Cloud Compute Edition*—License includes workload protection for hosts, containers, and serverless deployments. This offers both an agentless and an agent-based approach to protect assets across the application lifecycle. Prisma Cloud Compute edition is a self-operated software solution that you deploy, manage, and update in your own environments—whether public, private, or hybrid clouds—including entirely air-gapped environments.

* *Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition*—License provides several choices.
+
** *Standard*—An a la carte option where you can select any combination of Prisma Cloud capabilities with a standard success plan. The Enterprise edition—delivered as a SaaS model—combines agentless, API- and agent-based approaches to deliver comprehensive host, container, serverless, IaaS, PaaS, WAAS, IAM security, network security, code security, and data security for supported environments. It is an add-on approach where you can pick and choose the security capabilities that are most important to your organization. The capabilities protect you from the most sophisticated threats with advanced machine learning capabilities, network security monitoring, user entity behavior analysis (UEBA) for detecting location- and activity-based anomalies, and integration with host vulnerability management tools.

** *Prisma Cloud Runtime Security*—Licenses for the runtime security offerings are available with VM-based metering. You can choose from the bundles for Runtime Security Foundations and Runtime Security Advanced, and you can take advantage of additional capabilities as add-ons.
+
Runtime Security Foundations includes the core capabilities of Visibility, Compliance and Governance (VC&G), Threat Detection and Agentless Security. 
+
Runtime Security Advanced includes the core capabilities of Visibility, Compliance and Governance (VC&G), Threat Detection and Agentless Security along with Host Security, Container Security, and IAM Security.
+
Runtime Security Foundations and Runtime Security Advanced also include the option to activate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security (formerly known as Code Security) with developer based metering. Available modules include: Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and Secrets Scanning.

To take advantage of these new modules, switch from a resource-block based metering plan to a developer-based plan. You can make this switch from the *Settings > Code Security Configuration* page on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. After you switch, the new plan will calculate your credit usage based on the number of developers using the Code Security enabled modules.

[NOTE]
====
A Developer seat refers to an active Git committer, identified as such through their unique Git author email address. Anyone that made a contribution to a code repo protected by Prisma Cloud within the last 90 days can also be considered a Developer.
====
+
With the Enterprise Edition, you can optionally upgrade to a premium success plan that includes 24x7 access to customer success experts, custom workshops, implementation assistance, configuration and planning, and best practices guides.

Each of these offerings has a different capacity unit and unit price in Prisma Cloud Credits. The number of credits required to secure your assets can vary based on the offering and the size of your deployment. Refer to the https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/guides/prisma-cloud-pricing-and-editions[Prisma Cloud Licensing and Editions Guide] for details. Licensing is sold in increments of 100 credits and you estimate the number of units you need to monitor and protect.

//For details on how credits are calculated for Prisma Cloud Defenders, see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/welcome/licensing[Prisma Cloud Compute—Licensing].

=== License and Consumption Details

On the Prisma Cloud administrative console *Settings > Licensing*, you can easily view your active license plan, the average credit consumption trend, and details on how the average credits are being used by cloud type and each cloud account.
//You can also request to switch from and into the standard a la carte plan, Runtime Security Foundations, or Runtime Security Advanced plan.

The page is grouped in five sections:

* License Information—The complete details on the license type, the currently active license and support plan. It also includes information on your Prisma Cloud tenant, such as the serial number and tenant ID.

* Filters—The filters enable you to narrow the information in the consumption trend graph and the table. You can choose the time range, cloud type, cloud account and account group.
+
[NOTE]
====
The zip file download is available for the standard plan only. It provides a granular breakdown of assets that are consuming credits within a module.
====


* Consumption Trend Graph— The graph provides the overall view of your license consumption trends for the selected time period. You can review the average usage overlaid against the Prisma Cloud credits you have purchased and the actual credit usage trends. The usage trends can help you identify bursts in usage to meet short-term needs for your business and the steady usage as you accelerate or scale back in deploying assets in your cloud adoption journey.
+
The average usage graph presents a daily average for up to a 6-month period, and monthly averages for 6 months to last 3-year term.

* Consumption Details Table—The tabular format provides you with the average credit usage for run-time assets and build-time assets that you are monitoring with Prisma Cloud. The Build Time view displays usage information only if you have activated the Code Security subscription.
+
If you have environments where you have deployed Prisma Cloud Defenders either on-premises or on private or public cloud platforms that are not onboarded on Prisma Cloud, such as on OpenShift or on-prem Kubernetes clusters, these are grouped as *Other* cloud accounts. The row labeled Other displays the average credits used towards assets deployed on cloud environments that are not onboarded on Prisma Cloud.
+
You can also download the data that you are viewing in the table in a CSV file format. For a time period of 180 days, you can download daily usage information. To hide/show columns and reset the default view, use the column picker above the table.

//was last bullet in list above but removed because it was pulled out from 22.7.2.Credit Usage Summary—The *Optimize my Subscription* link presents you with a summary of credit usage for your active plan. This usage calculation is based on the asset—VMs and other billable assets— over the selected time range. You can review usage for last month, 3 months, and 6 months for the active plan and compare it against the estimation for a different plan. You can then request to talk to your Customer Success or Sales Representative directly to evaluate the pros and cons of adding more feature coverage or switching to another plan that is better for your consumption trends and security requirements. [NOTE] ==== You can switch the plan once in 6 months. ==== If you have switched plans within the selected time range, the average credit usage count in the License consumption trend indicated in the green, will not align with the credit usage count on the *Optimize my Subscription* summary.

=== Behavior on License Expiry
If your active Prisma Cloud license expires, you cannot log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console until you renew the license.

If the license is not renewed within the 90-day grace period after expiry, after 90 days, your Prisma Cloud tenant is deleted. The data and any history for the monitored accounts cannot be recovered.
