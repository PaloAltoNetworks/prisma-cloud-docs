Monitor your single or multi-cloud environment for adherence to mandated compliance standards, with Prisma Cloudâ€™s compliance reporting tools. Create reports based on a cloud compliance standard for immediate viewing or download, or schedule recurring reports to continue monitoring compliance over time. Each report provides you with a co nsolidated view of cloud account compliance with a selected standard. The report lists resources and accounts currently monitored against the standard, and details their compliance status. Cloud resources are tracked for compliance against every section of a given standard and detailed findings for each section are included along with remediation for non-compliant sections. From the Compliance Reports dashboard, you can also view or download historic reports to study compliance trends. Follow the steps below to create a Compliance Report:
