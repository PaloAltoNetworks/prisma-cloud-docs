== Configure Vulnerability Findings

Amazon GuardDuty Malware Findings is a malware detection service that provides vulnerability management for potentially compromised Amazon EC2 instances and containers running on EC2 (Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and customer managed Kubernetes). It detects suspicious activity on a workload and initiates a malware scan on the associated EC2 instance. When you enable malware protection and configure it on Prisma Cloud, if GuardDuty detects malware during the scan, it generates an additional finding that you can view on Prisma Cloud Resource page.

[NOTE]
====
* GuardDuty is currently supported only for AWS standalone and member accounts onboarded on Prisma Cloud.

* Enable EventBridge before you configure vulnerability findings using GuardDuty or Inspector.

.. *Download EventBridge CFT*. Depending on whether you enabled GuardDuty, Inspector, or both, the CFT will include the list of regions for the cloud account.

As part of the initial onboarding when you deploy the EventBridge CFT, Prisma Cloud creates 2 separate rules on AWS, one each for GuardDuty and Inspector.

.. Log in to your AWS account and follow the steps to create a stack, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names.*, and click *Create Stack*.

.. Wait for status to display CREATE_COMPLETE.

.. Return to your Prisma Cloud console and click *Next*.

.. Once the template is run successfully, *Review Status* displays *Successful* for each region.

If a Warning status displays for a region(s), click *Configure Details*, download the CFT again, and complete the steps.

.. Click *Save*. 

.. Once a *Successful* message displays for *Vulnerability Findings* on the account overview page, you can view the vulnerability and malware findings generated by AWS GuardDuty or vulnerabilities generated by AWS Inspector on the Prima Cloud *Investigate* page.
