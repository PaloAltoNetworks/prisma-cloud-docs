== Configure Flow Logs from Amazon S3

Prisma Cloud ingests the VPC flow logs from Amazon S3 buckets stored in a logging account and makes it available for network policy alerting and visualization. While onboarding your AWS account, you need to onboard the logging account which has the S3 bucket storing VPC flow logs for the monitored account.
