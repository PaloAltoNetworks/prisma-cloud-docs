== Update an Onboarded AWS Account
// Update the protection mode and the account groups that are secured with Prisma Cloud.

After you add your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, you may need to update the Prisma Cloud stack to provide additional permissions for new policies that are frequently added to help you monitor your cloud account and ensure that have a good security posture. When you update the CFT stack, Prisma Cloud can ingest data on new services that are supported. These CFTs are available directly from the Prisma Cloud administrative console. For instruction on updating your AWS Organization, see xref:add-aws-organization-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#idafad1015-aa36-473e-8d6a-a526c16d2c4f[Add an AWS Organization on Prisma Cloud].

In addition to updating the CFT stack for enabling permissions for new services, you can use this workflow to update the account groups that are secured with Prisma Cloud or to enable or disable the security capabilities and permissions.

[.procedure]
. Log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

. Select the AWS cloud account you want to modify.
+
Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts] and click the *Edit* icon for the cloud account to manage from the list of cloud accounts.

. In the *Edit Cloud Account* window, navigate to *Configure Account* and *Download IAM Role CFT*.

. tt:[(To change permissions for the Prisma Cloud role)] Update the Prisma Cloud App using the CFT you downloaded in the above step. You can update the stack either using the AWS console or the AWS CLI.

If you decide to create a new stack instead of updating the existing stack, you must copy the PrismaCloudRoleARN value from the CFT outputs tab.

.. Configure stack options.

.. *Next* and verify the settings.

.. *Preview your changes* to the CloudFormation template for the role you updated.

.. *Update* your CFT.
+
If you created a new stack, you must log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console and select your cloud account on menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts] to enter the *PrismaCloudRoleARN* value from the CFT output.

[TIP]
====
If you want to use https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface] to deploy the updated Prisma Cloud App stack.
Using the AWS CLI tool, enter the following command to deploy the CFT that you downloaded.

`aws cloudformation deploy --template-file /tmp/prisma-cloud-aws-iam-role.template --stack-name <Stack Name> --parameter-overrides PrismaCloudRoleName=<Role ARN> --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`
====

.. Check the Status to verify that Prisma Cloud can successfully retrieve information on your cloud resources.
