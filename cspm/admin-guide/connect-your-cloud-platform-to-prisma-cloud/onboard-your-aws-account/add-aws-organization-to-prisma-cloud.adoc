== Add an AWS Organization on Prisma Cloud

If you have consolidated access to AWS services and resources across your company within AWS Organizations, you can onboard the AWS _master account_ on Prisma Cloud. When you enable AWS Organizations on the AWS management console and add the root or _master_ account that has the role of a payer account that is responsible for paying all charges accrued by the accounts in its organization, all member accounts within the hierarchy are added in one streamlined operation on Prisma Cloud.

image::aws-org-structure.png[scale=30]

In this workflow, you first deploy a CFT in the master account to create the Prisma Cloud role to monitor, or monitor and protect your resources deployed on the master account. And then, you use CloudFormation StackSets to automate the creation of the Prisma Cloud role, which authorizes Prisma Cloud to access each member account. When you then add a new member account to your AWS organization, it is onboarded automatically on Prisma Cloud within a few (up to six) hours.

[NOTE]
====
* If you want to exclude one or more Organizational Units (OUs) and all the member accounts it includes, you can manually disable individual member accounts on Prisma Cloud after they are onboarded. Alternatively, to onboard a subset of accounts, you can exclude the OUs when deploying the StackSet so that the Prisma Cloud role is only created in the OUs for which you want to onboard accounts.

* If you had previously onboarded your AWS master account as a standalone or individual account, you must re-add the account as an Organization. All your existing data on assets monitored, alerts generated, or account groups created are left unchanged.
+
After you onboard your account as an AWS Organization, you cannot roll back. To add the account as a standalone or individual account, you must delete the Organization on Prisma Cloud and use the instructions to xref:add-aws-cloud-account-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#id8cd84221-0914-4a29-a7db-cc4d64312e56[Add an AWS Cloud Account on Prisma Cloud].

* If you had previously onboarded an AWS account that is a member of the AWS Organization that you now add on Prisma Cloud, all your existing data on assets monitored, alerts generated, or account groups created are left unchanged. On Prisma Cloud, the member account will be logically grouped under the AWS Organization.When you delete the AWS Organization on Prisma Cloud, you can recover all the existing data related to these accounts if you re-onboarded within 24 hours. After 24 hours, the data is deleted from Prisma Cloud.
* To enable Data Security for AWS account or at the AWS Organization level, see xref:../../prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/add-a-new-aws-account.adoc#idee00fe2e-51d4-4d26-b010-69f3c261ad6f[Enable Data Security].

. *Next*.

. Select the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* that you want to enable. Based on your selection, Prisma Cloud dynamically generates a CFT that includes the associated permissions for the Prisma Cloud role.
+
By default, *Agentless Workload Scanning* and *Serverless Function Scanning* are enabled. *Workload Discovery* is also automatically enabled to help you find all cloud-native services being used on your AWS cloud organization to help mitigate exposure.
+
image::add-aws-on-prisma-cloud-1-3.png[scale=30]

* Enable and add permissions for  *Agentless Workload Scanning* to scan hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a defender. Scans start automatically once you onboard your organization. You can also update scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for agentless scans.

* Enable and add permissions for *Serverless Function Scanning* to scan cloud provider functions such as, AWS Lambda, Azure, and Google functions for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[vulnerabilities] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/compliance/serverless[compliance]. Scans start automatically once you onboard your organization. You can also update scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for serverless scans.

* Add permissions for *Agent-Based Workload Protection*. The permissions allow for automated deployment of defenders to provide protection to secure cloud https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[VMs], containers, and Kubernetes orchestrators. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits, and other features required by defenders are also enabled. 

* Enable *Remediation* to address policy violations reported for remediable configuration policies on Prisma Cloud. This feature is not enabled by default. After you enable it, the Prisma Cloud role gets read-write access permissions to your AWS organization to successfully execute remediation commands.
+
After you onboard your AWS account on Prisma Cloud, the organization is automatically available in Compute and enabled for *Workload Discovery* and *Serverless Function* scans. You can also review the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/configure/permissions[permissions] required for individual security capabilities.

=== Update an Onboarded AWS Organization
In addition to updating the CFT stack for enabling permissions for new services, you can use this workflow to update the account groups that are secured with Prisma Cloud, update the remediation, and redeploy the Prisma Cloud role in member accounts. You can opt to onboard all member accounts under Organizations hierarchy, or selectively add the OUs whose member accounts you want to onboard on Prisma Cloud.

[.procedure]
. *Edit* the Org you previously onboarded. 

.. Log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

.. Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts] and click the *Edit* icon for the AWS Org from the list of cloud accounts.

.. In the *Edit Cloud Account* window, navigate to *Configure Account* and *Download IAM Role CFT*.

. Provision the Prisma Cloud role on the AWS master account.

.. Log in to your master account on the AWS management console.

.. Select menu:Services[CloudFormation > Stacks].

.. Select *PrismaCloudApp* Stack and click *Update Stack*.

.. Replace the existing template with the template (CFT) you downloaded in Step 1.
+
image::edit-aws-org-stacksets.png[scale=30]

.. *Next* to review the configuration.
+
image::aws-onboarding-aws-specify-stack-details-1.png[scale=30]
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure that you have entered the correct https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_details.html#orgs_view_root[OrganizationalUnitIds]. Provide the organizational root OU ID (prefix r-) to run it for all the accounts under the Organization, else provide a comma-separated list of OU IDs (prefix ou-).
====

.. Select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names*.

.. *Submit*.

. Paste the *IAM Role ARN* in your Prisma Cloud console.

. *Next*.

. Select the *Member Accounts* you want to add to Prisma Cloud.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can now edit to selectively assign AWS member accounts to different account groups on Prisma Cloud.
====

.. Select the subsets to include or exclude. Depending on the OUs you select, Prisma Cloud fetches and onboards the member accounts under each OU.
+
You can choose:
+
*** *All* (default) to monitor current and future OUs and member accounts included within the organization hierarchy.

*** *Include a subset* to only monitor selected OUs and member accounts.

*** *Exclude a subset* to monitor all current and future OUs and member accounts except the selected OUs and member accounts.
+
Select the relevant tab and choose the member accounts to include or exclude. When you select an OU, all existing member accounts within that OU are onboarded to Prisma Cloud. The periodic sync also checks for any new OUs and member accounts that you subsequently add on AWS and adds them to Prisma Cloud. For example, if there are 10 member accounts under an OU, Prisma Cloud starts monitoring those 10 accounts as soon as you save the setup. Later, if you add additional member accounts to this OU, those will be automatically onboarded and Prisma Cloud will start monitoring those accounts also within 24 hours. Similarly, if you delete a member account, after 24 hours it will be removed completely from Prisma Cloud.
+
You cannot select *Root* to be included or excluded from onboarding, you can either select all or a specific OU or member account.

.. *Load more in Root* to view more OUs and member accounts. By default, Prisma Cloud initially displays 20 OUs and 40 member accounts.

.. Resolve any missing permissions or errors.
+
A *Warning* displays if the OU or member account does not have adequate permissions.

. (tt:[Optional]) Select a different xref:../../manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-account-groups.adoc#id2e49ecdf-2c0a-4112-aa50-75c0d860aa8f[account group] and click *Next*.
+
During initial onboarding, you must assign all the member cloud accounts with the organization hierarchy to one account group.

. Review the onboarding *Status* of your AWS organization on Prisma Cloud.

. *Save*.
+
The status check verifies that audit events are available in at least one region on AWS CloudTrail. It also displays the number of member accounts that are provisioned with the Prisma Cloud role.
