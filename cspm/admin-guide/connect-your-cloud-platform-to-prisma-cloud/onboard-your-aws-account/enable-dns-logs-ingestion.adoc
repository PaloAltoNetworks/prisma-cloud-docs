== Configure DNS Logs Ingestion from Amazon

Prisma Cloud ingests the DNS logs from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and leverages those DNS query logs for DNS threat detection use cases, such as data exfiltration, DGAs, and cryptomining. Prisma Cloud fetches the DNS query logs for an account that is streamed in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Stream in a logging account on AWS.

.. Wait for status to display CREATE_COMPLETE.
+
On successful creation, PcEntryHeader, WebhookUrl, BackupS3BucketARN, and KinesisFirehoseRoleARN parameters are generated.

.. Create *Route-53 query logging config* and *firehose pipeline* per region by using CloudFormation StackSet .
+
[NOTE]
====
Running a stackset requires the following two roles. See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html[AWS documentation] to grant these self managed permissions:
+
** https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.yml[AWS Cloud Formation StackSet Administration Role]

** https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.yml[AWS Cloud Formation StackSet Execution Role]
====

.. After setting up the two roles, in your AWS console select menu:Settings[CloudFormation template > StackSets > Create StackSet].

.. Choose a template for StackSet creation using https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/cft/prisma-dnslogs.onboarding-cf
t-stack-part-2.template[Amazon S3 URL].
+

.. Enter the StackSet details, these are the parameters you obtained previously.
+

.. Set deployment options, such as account and regions for DNS query logging monitoring, and click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
** The account ID should match the one on which the first CFT was executed.
** Since you are using a logging account model for sending logs, make sure to apply both CFTs on the logging account and then share Route-53 query logging configuration with each account where you want to send DNS logs from.
** Sharing DNS Route-53 is ideal when you wnat to enable DNS ingestion for AWS organizations or Multiple accounts.
====
.. Review the configuration and *Submit* for StackSet creation.
+

..  After the AWS configuration changes are complete, go back to your Prisma Cloud console, select the *I acknowledge...* checkbox, and *Save* the configuration.

.. *Done*. On successful configuration, Prisma Cloud starts to ingest DNS logs from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
