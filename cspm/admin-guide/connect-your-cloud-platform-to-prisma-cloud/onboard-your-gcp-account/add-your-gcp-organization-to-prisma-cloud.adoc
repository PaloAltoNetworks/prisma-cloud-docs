== Add Your GCP Organization to Prisma Cloud
Add your GCP Organization and folders to Prisma Cloud to ingest and monitor your data.

Begin here to add a GCP Organization and folders to Prisma™ Cloud. If you have added a GCP project to Prisma Cloud and you now want to add the GCP Organization to which the project belongs, the existing GCP project is moved under the Organization in Prisma Cloud.

When you add the GCP Organization to Prisma Cloud, you can specify which folders and projects to include or exclude under the organization resource hierarchy.

[.procedure]
. Review the best practices for onboarding your GCP Organization to Prisma Cloud.
+
.. Enable the GCP APIs on each GCP project.
+
For the cloud services that you want Prisma Cloud to monitor or monitor and protect, you must enable the APIs listed in xref:set-up-gcp-account-for-prisma-cloud.adoc#id22f3927f-8f4e-4314-83cf-49a1373ba8de[Permissions and APIs Required for GCP Account on Prisma Cloud]. If a cloud service API is not enabled on a GCP project, Prisma Cloud skips the ingestion for the respective service; you must, however, ensure that Service Usage API is enabled on each GCP project that you want Prisma Cloud to monitor or monitor and protect under your GCP Organization hierarchy.
+
To skip ingestion for a cycle, Prisma cloud watches the response from the Service Usage API for the details on which cloud services are enabled in a GCP project. For example, if you have not enabled cloud functions in one or more GCP projects within the GCP Organization, Prisma cloud can learn about it and skip the ingestion cycle for this cloud service.

.. Create the service account in a dedicated GCP project.
+
GCP enforces a limit on the API calls allowed to a GCP project/IAM service account. When you create the service account in a dedicated GCP project, you can ensure that the API calls that Prisma Cloud makes do not interfere with any quota limits against your production workloads and services hosted in the separate GCP project.

.. Verify that you have granted all the required permissions to the Prisma Cloud service account.
+
If the service account does not have the IAM permissions required to retrieve data, Prisma Cloud skips ingestion of the respective cloud.service(s) for your onboarded account.

. xref:../../get-started-with-prisma-cloud/access-prisma-cloud.adoc#id3d308e0b-921e-4cac-b8fd-f5a48521aa03[Access Prisma Cloud] and select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add New].

. Select *Google Cloud* as the *Cloud to Secure*.

. Enter an *Account Name*.
+
A cloud account name is auto-populated for you. You can replace it with a cloud account name that uniquely identifies this GCP organization on Prisma™ Cloud.
+
image::add-gcp-step1.png[scale=40]

. Select *Organization* for *Onboard* and enter additional details.
+
image::add-gcp-step2-org.png[scale=40]
+
.. Enter your *Organization Name* and *Organization ID*.
+
All the GCP projects under the Organization hierarchy—current and future—will be monitored by Prisma Cloud. To find your GCP Organization ID, log in to the https://console.cloud.google.com[GCP console] and select your organization.
+
image::gcp-organization-info.png[scale=20]

.. Enter your *Project ID* and the name of your *Flow Logs Storage Bucket*.
+
Make sure to enter your Project ID and not your Project Number.

.. (tt:[Optional]) Enable *Use Dataflow to generate compressed logs*.
+
The Terraform template does not enable flow logs, and you must complete the workflow in xref:enable-flow-logs-for-gcp-organization.adoc#id1b0c6a58-24e6-4f60-b51f-12c5eac2a121[Enable Flow Logs for GCP Organization] for Prisma Cloud to retrieve flow logs. Additionally, if you want to enable flow log compression on Prisma cloud and address the lack of native compression support for flow logs sink setup on GCP, you must do it manually too. When you enable log compression, Prisma Cloud sets up the network and compute resources required for flow log compression and this can take up to five minutes.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you enable flow logs, the service ingests flow log data for the last seven days. Then if flow logs become unavailable for any reason such as if you manually disabled flow logs, modified API permissions, or an internal error occurred, when access is restored, logs from the preceding seven days only are ingested.
====

.. Enter the Project ID where you enabled the Cloud Dataflow service and click *Next*.
+
It is best if this project is where you send your VPC flow logs too.

. Select the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* that you want to enable. Based on your selection, Prisma Cloud dynamically generates a *Terraform Script* that includes the associated permissions for the Prisma Cloud role.
+
By default, *Agentless Workload Scanning* and *Serverless Function Scanning* are enabled. *Workload Discovery* is also automatically enabled to help you find all cloud-native services being used on your Google account to help mitigate exposure.
+
image::add-gcp-step3-org.png[scale=40]

* Enable and add permissions for  *Agentless Workload Scanning* to scan hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a defender. Scans start automatically once you onboard your account. You can also update scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for agentless scans.

* Enable and add permissions for *Serverless Function Scanning* to scan cloud provider functions such as, Google functions for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[vulnerabilities] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/compliance/serverless[compliance]. Scans start automatically once you onboard your account. You can also update scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for serverless scans.

* Add permissions for *Agent Based Workload Protection*. The permissions allow for automated deployment of defenders to provide protection to secure cloud https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[VMs], containers, and Kubernetes orchestrators. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits, and other features required by defenders are also enabled. 

* Enable *Remediation* to address policy violations reported for remediable configuration policies on Prisma Cloud. This feature is not enabled by default. After you enable it, the Prisma Cloud role gets read-write access permissions to your Google cloud account to successfully execute remediation commands.
+
After you onboard your Google account on Prisma Cloud, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for *Workload Discovery* and *Serverless Function* scans. You can also review the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/configure/permissions[permissions] required for individual security capabilities.

. Configure up the Service *Account* for Prisma Cloud.
+
image::add-gcp-step4-org.png[scale=40]
+
A service account is an identity to which you can grant granular permissions instead of creating individual user accounts. To monitor all the GCP projects that are within the GCP Organizational hierarchy, the service account requires four roles. Of the four roles, three are common for granting permissions at the GCP project level too; the Organization Role Viewer and Folder Viewer roles are additionally required to grant access to the Organization's properties:
+
* Viewer—Primitive role.
* (tt:[Required for Prisma Cloud Compute, Optional for Prisma Cloud]) Compute Security Admin—Predefined role.
* Prisma Cloud Viewer—Custom role.
* Organization Role Viewer—Predefined role.
* Folder Viewer—Predefined role.

.. *Download Terraform Script*.
+
Prisma Cloud recommends that you create a directory to store the Terraform template you download. This allows you to manage the templates when you add a different Google organization to Prisma Cloud. Give the directory a name that uniquely identifies the subscription for which you're using it (for example, onboard-<subscription-name>).

.. Open a new tab on your browser and sign in to the https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor[Google Cloud Shell].

.. Upload the template to the Google Cloud Shell.
+
After the Terraform script is ran, a JSON file will be created that saves the credentials to a file with the following format: userinput:[OrgId-randomString.json] 

.. Enable the GCP APIs.
+
In the GCP project where you created the service account, you must enable the Stackdriver Logging API (logging.googleapis.com) to monitor audit logs, and any other https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/gcp-apis-ingested-by-prisma-cloud.html[GCP APIs] for which you want Prisma Cloud to monitor resources. For example, in the Google Cloud Shell, enter:
+
[userinput]
----
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com sql-component.googleapis.com storage-component.googleapis.com appengine.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com monitoring.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com cloudkms.googleapis.com bigquery-json.googleapis.com dns.googleapis.com dataflow.googleapis.com
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This is not an exhaustive list of the GCP APIs. To view the most recent list, view https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/gcp-apis-ingested-by-prisma-cloud.html[GCP APIs].
====

. Select the projects you want to add to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select the projects to include or exclude.
+
You can choose to include:
+
* *All projects* included within the organization hierarchy.
* *Include a subset* or *Exclude a subset* of projects. Select the relevant tab and choose the projects to include or exclude.
+
When you select a folder, all existing projects within that folder or sub-folder are onboarded to Prisma Cloud. The periodic sync also checks for any new projects and sub-folders that you subsequently add on the cloud platform and adds them to Prisma Cloud.
+
image::add-gcp-step5-org.png[scale=40]

.. Resolve any missing permissions or errors.
+
If the service account does not have adequate permissions, the following warning displays.
+
image::gcp-permissions-folder-missing.png[scale=40]
+
[NOTE]
====
If the folders permissions are missing, the option to *AutoMap* and create account groups recursively based on your GCP resource hierarchy is disabled.
====
+
If the service account is deleted, or disabled or when the key is deleted on the Google Cloud console, an error message displays. Update the Service Account Key to continue the onboarding process.

. *Configure Account Groups*.
+
You have two options for assigning account groups to this GCP organization account. Select an account group manually.
+
With *Automap* disabled, you can select the account groups and assign it to this account.
+
Or, if you selected *Exclude a subset* of folders, the ability to *Maintain recursive hierarchy* is disabled and you must select account groups manually.
+
image::configure-account-groups-automap-off.png[scale=40]

.. Allow Prisma Cloud to create account groups automatically. Based on the folders you selected earlier, Prisma Cloud can automatically create account groups and keep it synchronized with the GCP resource hierarchy.
+
.. Select *Automap*, to create an account group for each top-level folder in the hierarchy.

.. Select *Maintain Recursive Hierarchy* to create account groups for the folders that are nested within your GCP organization hierarchy.
+
When you choose to create account groups recursively, each account group includes a list of all GCP projects nested within the heirarchical folder structure as you see it on the GCP console. Because the account groups are organized in a flat structure on Prisma Cloud, you cannot see the mapping visually.
+
image::configure-account-groups.png[scale=40]
+
Account groups that are created automatically are indicated with image:automap-icon.png[scale=20], and cannot be edited on Prisma Cloud. See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-account-groups[create account groups] for more details.

.. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/create-an-alert-rule.html#idd1af59f7-792f-42bf-9d63-12d29ca7a950[Create an Alert Rule for Run-Time Checks] to associate the account group with it to generate alerts when a policy violation occurs.

. Review the onboarding *Status* of your GCP Organization to Prisma Cloud and click *Save*.
+
image::add-gcp-status-org.png[scale=40]
+
When you have nested projects allow 10-30 minutes for the auto created account groups to display on Prisma Cloud. 
+
[NOTE]
====
It will take a maximum of 30 minutes for projects to appear on Prisma Cloud.
====
+
You can review the status and take necessary actions to resolve any issues encountered during the onboarding process by viewing the *Cloud Accounts* page. It takes between 4-24 hours for the flow log data to be exported and analyzed before you can review it on Prisma Cloud. To verify if the flow log data from your GCP Organization have been analyzed, you can run a network query on the *Investigate* page.
+
[NOTE]
====
* When you delete the GCP Organization on Prisma Cloud, you can recover all the existing data related to these accounts if you re-onboard within 24 hours. After 24hours, the data is deleted from Prisma Cloud.
* Because Prisma Cloud has access to all projects associated with a Service Account, if you want to remove access to a project that is associated with the Service Account, you must remove the project from the Service Account on the GCP IAM console. In the next scanning cycle, the project is excluded and Prisma Cloud no longer has access to the project.
====

.. Go to *Cloud Accounts*, locate your GCP account and view the status.
+
image::add-gcp-status-org-2.png[scale=30]

.. Verify the projects that are onboarded to Prisma Cloud.
+
Select the cloud account name and review the list of projects to verify the include/exclude selections you made earlier.
+
image::add-gcp-status-org-3.png[scale=30]

.. Go to *Investigate*, replace the name with your GCP Cloud Account name and enter the following network query.
+
This query allows you to list all network traffic from the Internet or from Suspicious IP addresses with over 0 bytes of data transferred to a network interface on any resource on any cloud environment.
+
[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where source.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs') AND bytes > 0
