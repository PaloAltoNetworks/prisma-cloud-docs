== Onboard Your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account
Learn how to onboard your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organization and projects to Prisma™ Cloud for monitoring.

To enable Prisma™ Cloud to retrieve data on your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources and identify potential security risks and compliance issues, you must connect your GCP accounts to Prisma Cloud. In keeping with the GCP resource hierarchy, you can choose whether you want Prisma Cloud to monitor one or more GCP Projects or all projects that are under your GCP Organization. Regardless of what you choose, the process of onboarding automates the process of creating a service account, creating and associating roles with the service account, and enabling specific APIs.
