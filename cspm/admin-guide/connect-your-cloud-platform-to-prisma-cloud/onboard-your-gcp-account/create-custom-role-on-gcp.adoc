== Create a Service Account With a Custom Role for GCP

If you prefer to create a service account with more granular permissions to xref:add-your-gcp-organization-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#id333e8bbf-ae4d-443b-8365-95971069045a[Add Your GCP Organization to Prisma Cloud]or xref:add-your-gcp-projects-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#id0d4f5087-89a7-4dfa-9625-76cece91cb38[Add Your GCP Project to Prisma Cloud], instead of using the Terraform template which grants the Viewer (primitive) role for read-only access to resources in your GCP account, use the following instructions.

[NOTE]
====
* If you enable granular permissions, you must update the custom role and add additional permissions that maybe required to ingest data from any new service that is added on Prisma Cloud.

* To enable dataflow log compression using the Dataflow service, you must enable additional permissions. See xref:dataflow-compression.adoc#idd17cd38a-ea89-495d-9c2e-ad67ac646d16[] for details on ingesting network log data.

+
.. Select the GCP project in which you want to create the custom role.

.. Upload the YAML file to the Cloud Shell.

.. Run the gcloud command userinput:[gcloud iam roles create <prisma customrole name> --project <project-ID> --file <YAML file name>]
