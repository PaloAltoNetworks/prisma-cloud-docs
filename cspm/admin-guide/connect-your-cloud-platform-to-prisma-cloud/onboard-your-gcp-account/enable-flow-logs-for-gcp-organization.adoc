== Enable Flow Logs for GCP Organization

Create and configure a sink to export the flow logs for your GCP organization.

Prisma Cloud uses the traffic data in flow logs for your GCP organization or folder resource hierarchy to detect network threats such as cryptomining, data exfiltration, and host compromises. Before Prisma Cloud can analyze your flow log data, you must create a sink to export the flow logs to a Cloud Storage bucket. To configure a sink for your whole GCP organization or folder, use the gcloud command line tool.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling flow logs will incur high network egress costs. Palo Alto Networks strongly recommends that you enable xref:dataflow-compression.adoc#idd17cd38a-ea89-495d-9c2e-ad67ac646d16[] to significantly reduce the network egress costs associated with sending uncompressed GCP logs to the Prisma Cloud infrastructure.

[.procedure]
. Gather the following information from your https://console.cloud.google.com[GCP account]:
+
** Cloud Storage bucket name

** Organization ID

. Download and install the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/[Google Cloud SDK].
+
During the SDK install, you must log in to your GCP account. This account must have these three permissions enabled at the organization level:
+
** Billing Account Administrator

** Logging Administrator

** Organization Administrator

. Run this command to create a service account needed to configure the sink for your Cloud Storage bucket but replace the *Bucket-name* with your Cloud Storage bucket name and *Organization ID* with your organization ID.

[NOTE]
====
If you are onboarding a GCP folder, you must have the https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#resource-manager-roles[Folder Viewer] role and can use the command userinput:[$ gcloud logging sinks create <sink-name> storage.googleapis.com/<bucket-name> --include-children --folder=<folder-id> --log-filter="resource.type="gce_subnetwork" AND logName:"logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows""] to create a service account needed to configure the sink for your Cloud Storage bucket.
====

. Grant the service account permission to access your Cloud Storage bucket.
+
.. Select menu:Navigation{sp}menu[Storage] and select your Cloud Storage bucket.

.. Select menu:Permissions[Add members].

.. Add the service account email address for *Members*, select menu:Storage[Storage Admin] and select *Add*.

. Add the name of Cloud Storage bucket you created above in *Flow Logs Storage Bucket* when you xref:add-your-gcp-organization-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#id333e8bbf-ae4d-443b-8365-95971069045a[Add Your GCP Organization to Prisma Cloud].

. (tt:[Optional]) Enable xref:dataflow-compression.adoc#idd17cd38a-ea89-495d-9c2e-ad67ac646d16[].

Enable flow log compression on Prisma Cloud to automate the compression of flow logs using the Google Cloud Dataflow service. When enabled, the compressed logs are stored to the same Storage bucket as your flow logs and mitigates the network egress costs associated with sending uncompressed GCP logs to the Prisma Cloud infrastructure.
