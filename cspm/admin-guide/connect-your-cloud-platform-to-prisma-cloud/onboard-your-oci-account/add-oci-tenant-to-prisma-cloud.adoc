== Add Your OCI Tenant to Prisma Cloud

Your OCI tenant has a root compartment (tenancy) by default. To onboard your OCI tenant, you will need the root compartment's OCID.

You must onboard OCI at the tenant level and any child compartments will be automatically onboarded on Prisma Cloud.

Each OCI tenant is associated with a Home region. Prisma Cloud is available for visibility and monitoring of your OCI tenants in all OCI-supported https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm[cloud regions].

[.procedure]
. *Add OCI Tenant*
+
To start monitoring your resources on OCI, add your OCI tenant to Prisma Cloud.
+
.. xref:../../get-started-with-prisma-cloud/access-prisma-cloud.adoc#id3d308e0b-921e-4cac-b8fd-f5a48521aa03[Access Prisma Cloud] and select "Settings > Cloud Accounts > Add Cloud Account".


.. Select *Oracle Cloud* as the cloud provider to onboard and secure your account.
+
image::ftu-cloud-selection.png[scale=40]

.. Enter a *Cloud Account Name* that uniquely identifies your OCI tenant on Prisma Cloud and click *Next*.
+

. *Add Tenant Details*
+
In OCI, administrator resources are only created at the tenant level. To ingest those resources, you must first onboard the OCI tenant in Prisma Cloud by entering the root compartment OCID and home region from the OCI console.
+
.. Log in to your OCI console and select "Identity & Security > Identity > Compartments".

.. Copy the *OCID* of the root compartment.
+
image::oci-tenant-console-1.png[scale=40]

.. Return to the Prisma Cloud Onboarding Setup page and paste the OCID in the *Tenant/Root OCID* field.

.. Select the *Home Region* where the tenant is created (for example, us-phoenix-1) and click *Next*.

.. Follow the steps in xref:id5ac2883d-d1ed-44a3-bd63-cc3fabedf477/create-a-user[Create a User to Enable Access], to create a new user, group, and policy that correspond to OCI Identity User Name, Group Name, and Policy Name.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use an existing user with the correct privileges, an existing group, and an existing policy with the correct policy statements. However, it is recommended that you create a new user, group, and policy as described in xref:id5ac2883d-d1ed-44a3-bd63-cc3fabedf477/create-a-user[Create a User to Enable Access]
====
+
image::oci-onboard-setup-2.png[scale=40]


. [[create-a-user]]*Create a User to Enable Access*
+
Use the Terraform template to generate a new user OCID. The User Name, Group Name, and Policy Name must be unique and should not be present in your OCI tenant.
+
.. *Click to download the terraform* template to your local machine. 
+
[NOTE]
====
To onboard the Oracle Cloud account, a public key is needed to access the OCI API. This public key is embedded in the Terraform template, and it changes each time you download the template. Therefore, when creating a stack, make sure to use the most recent Terraform file that you downloaded.
====
+
image::oci-onboard-setup-6.png[scale=40]


.. Check the OCI console to see if the *Primary email address required* checkbox is disabled.
+
To ensure that the Terraform file runs successfully, uncheck the *Primary email address required* checkbox. 
+
... Log in to your OCI tenant console.

... Navigate to "Identity > Domains > Default Domain > Settings > Domain Settings".

... Disable the *Primary email address required* checkbox if it is enabled.
+
image::oci-uncheck-primary-email-address-reqd.png[scale=40]

... *Save changes*.
+
If you want to keep the *Primary email address required* checkbox enabled on your console, add your OCI tenant administrator's email address to the userinput:[oci identity user] email field in the Terraform file before running it.
+
[userinput]
----
resource "oci_identity_user" "user" {
name           = "oci_user_name_param"
description    = "user created by terraform"
email          = "<oci-tenant-administrator-email-address>"
compartment_id = "oci_tenant_id_param"
}
----

Select the xref:../../manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-account-groups.adoc#id2e49ecdf-2c0a-4112-aa50-75c0d860aa8f[Account Groups] to associate with your OCI tenant and click *Next*.
+
You must assign each cloud account to an account group, and xref:../../manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/create-an-alert-rule.adoc#idd1af59f7-792f-42bf-9d63-12d29ca7a950[Create an Alert Rule for Run-Time Checks] to associate the account group with it to generate alerts when a policy violation occurs.
+
image::oci-onboard-setup-4.png[scale=50]

. *Cloud Account Status*
+
.. Review the onboarding Status of your OCI account on Prisma Cloud and click *Save*.
+
The status check verifies the OCI tenant and the number of compartments available under that tenant. Prisma Cloud ingests the child compartment(s) along with the root tenant.
+
image::oci-onboard-setup-5.png[scale=50]

.. After successfully onboarding the account, you will see it on the *Cloud Accounts* page.
+
image::oci-onboard-verify-1.png[scale=30]

. *Next Steps*
+
.. It can take up to an hour for the ingestion to complete after which you can view the resources in Prisma Cloud, review, and act on the alerts generated.

.. Configure xref:../../manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/create-an-alert-rule.adoc#idd1af59f7-792f-42bf-9d63-12d29ca7a950[Alert Rule] to include OCI policies.

.. If you do not want to ingest data from any of the child compartments:
+
... Navigate to "Settings > Cloud Accounts".

... Click the *Name* of the tenant you have onboarded.

... The tenant is also displayed as a compartment. Select the child compartments you want to disable.
