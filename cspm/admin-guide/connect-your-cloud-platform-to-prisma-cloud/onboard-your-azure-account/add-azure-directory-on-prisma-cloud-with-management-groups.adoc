== Add an Azure Active Directory Tenant With Management Groups
Add your Azure commercial tenant to Prisma Cloud with optional management groups so that you can group your organization’s cloud resources into a logical hierarchy.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Microsoft Azure (commercial) tenant with optional management groups enables you to ingest the cloud resources and configuration metadata so that Prisma Cloud can group these cloud resources into a logical hierarchy. You have two options for onboarding your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to Prisma Cloud: with Terraform which automatically creates your Azure resources, or through Azure portal which enables you to manually creates your Azure resources.

=== Add Azure Active Directory Tenant With Management Groups—Automatic

Connect your Azure Active Directory Tenant with management groups to Prisma Cloud using the automatic workflow.

[.procedure]
. Select Azure as the cloud type to onboard on Prisma Cloud.
+
.. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/access-prisma-cloud.html#id3d308e0b-921e-4cac-b8fd-f5a48521aa03[Access Prisma Cloud].

.. Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add Cloud Account > Azure].

. Configure the initial onboarding options.
+
** *Cloud Account Name*—Enter a descriptive name to represent the cloud account that you will onboard to Prisma Cloud.

** *Onboard*—Select *Azure Tenant* to onboard your Azure AD tenant.

** *Azure Cloud Type*—Select *Commercial* to onboard your Microsoft Azure (Commercial) account.

** *Onboard Azure Management Groups and Subscriptions*—Leave this check box enabled to retrieve all the Azure Management Groups and Subscriptions associated with the tenant.

** Select *Commercial* as the Prisma Cloud type.

. On the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* page, you have the option to enable permissions for the following additional capabilities. Based on your
selection, Prisma Cloud dynamically generates a Terraform template that includes the associated permissions for the Prisma Cloud role. Prisma Cloud Role provides permissions for security capabilities required. By default, the role provides permissions for cloud discovery for resources and workloads, misconfiguration detection, and threat detection.
+
Agentless Workload Scanning and Serverless Function Scanning are enabled by default. Workload Discovery is also automatically enabled to help you identify all the cloud-native services used on your cloud account. By default, the Prisma Cloud role is granted the appropriate https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/azure-onboarding-checklist#id04489406-4377-448f-8d6c-d1623dcce1e7[permissions] to monitor your cloud account.
+
image::sec-cap-perms.png[30]
+
* Enable and add permissions for  *Agentless Workload Scanning* to scan hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a Defender. Scans start automatically once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Agentless scans.

* Enable and add permissions for *Serverless Function Scanning*  to scan cloud provider functions like AWS Lambda, Azure and Google functions for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[vulnerabilities] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/compliance/serverless[compliance]. Scans are automatically initiated once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Serverless scans. 

* Add permissions needed for *Agent-Based Workload Protection*. The permissions allow for automated deployment of Defenders to  provide protection to secure cloud https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[VMs], containers and Kubernetes orchestrators. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits and other features required by defenders are also enabled.

* Enable https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/add-a-new-azure-account-pcds[Data Security] to scan your resources to prevent data leaks. This is not enabled by default. After you onboard your account, further configuration is required to enable data scans.

* Enable *Remediation* to address policy violations reported for remediable Configuration policies on Prisma Cloud. This is not enabled by default. When enabled, the Prisma Cloud role gets read-write access permissions to your Azure cloud account to successfully execute remediation commands.
+
Once your Azure account is onboarded on Prisma Cloud, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans. You can also review the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/azure-commercial-permissions-security-coverage.txt[permissions] required for individual security capabilities. 

. Enter your Azure application data into Prisma Cloud.
+
The Azure application details to capture are as follows:
+
** *Application (Client) ID*—A public identifier for your app registration.

** *Application Client Secret*—A secret string that the app uses to prove its identity when requesting a token. Also can be referred to as the application password.

** *Enterprise Application Object ID*—A unique value for the enterprise application.
+
.. Download the Terraform script from the Prisma Cloud user interface.

.. Log in to https://shell.azure.com[Azure shell].

.. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/azure-onboarding-checklist.html#id04489406-4377-448f-8d6c-d1623dcce1e7[Elevate access for a Global Administrator] to enable Prisma Cloud access to Azure subscriptions or management groups.

.. Upload the Terraform script to Azure portal by clicking the Upload/Download files button in the Azure CLI. 

.. Run the following Terraform commands:
+
*  userinput:[terraform init] 
*  userinput:[terraform apply] 
* Copy the *Application (Client) ID*, *Application Client Secret*, and *Enterprise Application Object ID* to a secure location on your computer.

.. Grant admin consent.
+
*** Click on the varname:[e_consent_link] link which will redirect you to the *API permissions* section in Azure portal.

*** Click *Grant admin consent for Default Directory* and select *Yes*.
+
A success message should appear with the text *grant consent successful*.

*** Verify that the status column has green check marks.

.. Enter your *Application (Client) ID*, *Application Client Secret*, and *Enterprise Application Object ID* details into the Prisma Cloud UI.

.. tt:[Optional]—Enable Network Security Group Flow Logs.
+
If you want to view the NSG flow logs on Prisma Cloud, ensure that *Ingest and Monitor Network Security Group Flow Logs* is enabled.
+
If you enable this option on Prisma Cloud, authenticate into https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal] and complete the following tasks:
+
*** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal#enable-network-watcher[Enable Network Watcher and register Insights provider].

*** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal[Create a storage account on Azure] for NSG flow logs.
+
Your Azure storage account stores the flow logs that are required for Prisma Cloud to monitor and analyze network traffic. When Prisma Cloud ingests the data in these logs, you can interact with the information in Prisma Cloud. For example, you can run queries against the data, visualize network topology, and investigate traffic flows between two instances. You can also apply network policies to this traffic.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not have regulatory guidelines that specify a log retention period to which you must adhere, we recommend you set retention to at least 15 days.
