== Add an Azure China Tenant on Prisma Cloud
Onboard your Azure China resources to Prisma Cloud with or without management groups.

Connecting Prisma ™ Cloud to your Azure China tenant enables you to ingest your cloud resources and configuration metadata so that Prisma Cloud can monitor your Azure China resources for security violations. There are two workflows for onboarding your Azure China tenants: with management groups so that you can organize your Azure resources into logical groups for more granular monitoring, or without management groups which doesn’t enable you to organize your resources into a hierarchy.
