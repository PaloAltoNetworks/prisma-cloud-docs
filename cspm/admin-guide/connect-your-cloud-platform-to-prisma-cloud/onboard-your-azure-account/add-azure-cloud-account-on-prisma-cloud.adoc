== Add an Azure Subscription on Prisma Cloud
Connect your Azure commercial or Government, or Azure China subscription on Prisma Cloud to analyze traffic logs and monitor resources for potential security and compliance issues.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Azure cloud account enables you to analyze and monitor traffic logs, and detect potential malicious network activity or compliance issues. To enable API access between Prisma Cloud and your Microsoft Azure Subscription, you need to gather account information about your subscription and Azure Active Directory so that Prisma Cloud can monitor the resources in your cloud account, and add one subscription at a time.

If you are adding an Azure commercial account, this workflow uses Terraform templates to streamline the set up process. The template automates the process of creating and registering Prisma Cloud as an application on your Active Directory and creating the Service Principal and associating the roles required to enable authentication.

If you don’t want to use Terraform, or are adding an Azure Government or Azure China subscription, you must complete some tasks manually on the Azure portal.

=== Add Azure Commercial Subscription on Prisma Cloud

[.procedure]
. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/access-prisma-cloud.html#id3d308e0b-921e-4cac-b8fd-f5a48521aa03[Access Prisma Cloud] and select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add New].

. Select *Azure* as the *Cloud to Protect*.

. Enter a *Cloud Account Name*.
+
A cloud account name is auto-populated for you. You can replace it with it a cloud account name that uniquely identifies your Azure subscription on Prisma Cloud.
+
image::add-azure-step1.png[]

. Select the *Mode*.
+
Decide whether to enable permissions to only *monitor* (read-only access) or to *monitor and protect* (read-write access) the resources in your cloud account. Your selection determines which Terraform template is used to automate the process of creating the custom role required for Prisma Cloud.

. Enter your Directory (Tenant) ID and Subscription ID.
+
Prisma Cloud requires your Azure *Subscription ID* so that it can identify your Azure cloud account and retrieve the storage account and key vault information. Prisma Cloud also needs the *Directory (Tenant) ID* which identifies your tenant.
+

+++<draft-comment>is this correct?</draft-comment>+++
+
.. *Get the directory tenant id*—In Azure portal, click *Properties* and copy the *Tenant ID*.

.. *Get the subscription id*—In Azure portal, select menu:All{sp}resources[(Your Azure subscription)], and then copy *Subscription ID*.
+
image::add-azure-comm-step-2.png[]

. Download the Terraform template.
+
Prisma Cloud recommends that you create a directory to store the Terraform template you download. This allows you to manage the templates when you add a different Azure subscription to Prisma Cloud. Give the directory a name that uniquely identifies the subscription for which you're using it (for example, onboard-<subscription-name>).
+
.. Log in to the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] Cloud Shell (Bash).
+
image::azure-power-shell.png[scale=60]

.. Upload the template to the Cloud Shell.

.. Run the following Terraform commands.
+
* userinput:[terraform init] 
* userinput:[terraform apply] 
+
[NOTE]
====
After you enter userinput:[terraform apply] the CLI will ask: *Do you want to perform these actions?*. Type *yes* and hit enter.
====
+
Get the *Application Client Secret*, *Application (Client) ID*, and the *Enterprise Application Object ID* from the CLI and enter it into the Prisma Cloud UI.
+
image::add-azure-comm-step-2-1.png[scale=60]

.. Select *Ingest & Monitor Network Security Group flow logs* and click *Next*.
+
Network security group (NSG) flow logs are a feature of Network Watcher that allows you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through an NSG. You must first configure Network Security Groups on Azure and assign a storage account to enable Flow log ingestion on Prisma Cloud. Make sure that Azure Flow logs are stored within a storage account in the same region as the NSG. If you want to enable flow log ingestion, you must complete the tasks outlined in Step 9 in xref:register-an-app-on-azure-active-directory.adoc#ida0e4567f-7cf3-455b-b755-b2e2072ae0a0[Register an App on Azure Active Directory]. If you enable this option without setting it up on the Azure portal, Prisma Cloud will not be able to retrieve any Flow logs.

. Select the *Account Groups* you want to add and click *Next*. +++<draft-comment>cloud-onboarding-account-groups.png</draft-comment>+++
+
image::cloud-onboarding-account-groups.png[scale=60]
+
You must assign each cloud account to an account group, and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/create-an-alert-rule.html#idd1af59f7-792f-42bf-9d63-12d29ca7a950[Create an Alert Rule for Run-Time Checks] to associate the account group with it to generate alerts when a policy violation occurs.

. Verify the *Status* and click *Done*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If Prisma Cloud is able to successfully connect to your Azure subscription and retrieve information, the status is displayed with a green check mark. If Prisma Cloud is unable to retrieve the logs, the error message indicates what failed. See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/troubleshoot-azure-account-onboarding.html#id6b7e6e40-9ce7-43d8-b5b5-1dcc607d8e9b[Troubleshoot Azure Account Onboarding] for help.
====
+
image::add-azure-status-green.png[]

. Verify that you can view the information on your Azure resources on Prisma Cloud.
+
Depending on the number of resources in the accounts onboarded the data that was collected about your Azure resources can take up until a hour to display. After Prisma Cloud ingests data, the information is available for compliance checks, configuration review, audit history, and network visualization.
+
[NOTE]
====
It takes about four to six hours before you can view flow logs in Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud ingests flow logs from the previous seven days from when you onboard the account.
====

+
.. Log in to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select *Investigate* and enter the following RQL query.
+
This query allows you to list all network traffic from the Internet or from Suspicious IP addresses with over 0 bytes of data transferred to a network interface on any resource on any cloud environment. Replace varname:[‘<cloud account name>’] with the name of your actual cloud account.
+
----
network from vpc.flow_record where cloud.account = '<cloud account name>' AND source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs' ) AND bytes > 0

=== Add an Azure China Subscription on Prisma Cloud

Connect your Azure China subscription on Prisma Cloud to monitor resources for potential security and compliance issues.

You require a Prisma Cloud instance in China to monitor or monitor and protect your deployments in the Microsoft Azure China regions. To get started with monitoring your subscriptions in Azure China, gather the details listed in xref:register-an-app-on-azure-active-directory.adoc#ida0e4567f-7cf3-455b-b755-b2e2072ae0a0[Register an App on Azure Active Directory] from the https://portal.azure.cn/[Azure China portal]. When you add the subscription, Prisma Cloud monitors the configuration metadata for your IaaS and PaaS services and identifies potential resource misconfiguration and improper exposure. It also enables you to use data ingested from event logs and network flow logs for better visibility and governance.

When you onboard your Azure China subscription on Prisma Cloud, review the following differences as compared to Azure Commercial:

* Support for Terraform templates to onboard a cloud account for Azure China is not available.
* On app.prismacloud.cn, you cannot onboard any accounts that are not deployed on Azure China regions.

[.procedure]
. Add your Azure subscription on Prisma Cloud.

.. Log in to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add New]

.. Select *Cloud Type* Azure and click *Next*.

.. Enter a *Cloud Account Name*.
