== Add an Azure Subscription on Prisma Cloud
Connect your Azure Commercial, Government, or Azure China subscription on Prisma Cloud to analyze traffic logs and monitor resources for potential security and compliance issues.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Azure cloud account enables you to analyze and monitor traffic logs, and detect potential malicious network activity or compliance issues. To enable API access between Prisma Cloud and your Microsoft Azure Subscription, you need to gather account information about your subscription and Azure Active Directory so that Prisma Cloud can monitor the resources in your cloud account.

If you are adding an Azure Commercial account, this workflow uses Terraform templates to streamline the set up process. The template automates the process of creating and registering Prisma Cloud as an application on your Active Directory and creating the Service Principal and associating the roles required to enable authentication.

If you do not want to use Terraform, or are adding an Azure Government or Azure China subscription, you must complete some tasks manually on the Azure portal.

* Enable and add permissions for  *Agentless Workload Scanning* to scan hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a Defender. Scans start automatically once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Agentless scans.

* Enable and add permissions for *Serverless Function Scanning*  to scan cloud provider functions like AWS Lambda, Azure and Google functions for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[vulnerabilities] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/compliance/serverless[compliance]. Scans are automatically initiated once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Serverless scans. 

* Add permissions needed for *Agent-Based Workload Protection*. The permissions allow for automated deployment of Defenders to  provide protection to secure cloud https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[VMs], containers and Kubernetes orchestrators. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits and other features required by defenders are also enabled.

* Enable https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/add-a-new-azure-account-pcds[Data Security] to scan your resources to prevent data leaks. This is not enabled by default. After you onboard your account, further configuration is required to enable data scans.

* Enable *Remediation* to address policy violations reported for remediable Configuration policies on Prisma Cloud. This is not enabled by default. When enabled, the Prisma Cloud role gets read-write access permissions to your Azure cloud account to successfully execute remediation commands.
+
Once your Azure account is onboarded on Prisma Cloud, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans. You can also review the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/azure-commercial-permissions-security-coverage.txt[permissions] required for individual security capabilities. 
 
. Enter your Directory (Tenant) ID and Subscription ID.
+
Prisma Cloud requires your Azure *Subscription ID* so that it can identify your Azure cloud account and retrieve the storage account and key vault information. Your *Directory (Tenant) ID* identifying your tenant is also required.
+

.. *Get the directory tenant id*—In your Azure portal, click *Properties* and copy the *Tenant ID*.

.. *Get the subscription id*—In your Azure portal, select menu:All{sp}resources[(Your Azure subscription)], and then copy *Subscription ID*.
