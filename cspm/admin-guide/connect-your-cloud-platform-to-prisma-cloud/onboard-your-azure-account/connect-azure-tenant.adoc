== Connect your Azure Tenant 

Learn how to <<commercial>>, <<government>>, or <<china>> on Prisma Cloud. Onboarding an *Azure Tenant* connects all your Azure resources to Prisma Cloud including Accounts with Management Groups, Subscriptions and Active Directory.

Connecting Prismaâ„¢ Cloud to your Azure cloud account enables you to analyze and monitor traffic logs, and detect potential malicious network activity or compliance issues. During the built-in onboarding process you have the option of using one of the following three methods to create the required Azure resources to authorize Prisma Cloud to access Azure APIs:

* xref:authorize-prisma-cloud.adoc#terraform[Terraform] (Recommended)
This workflow automates the process of setting up the Prisma Cloud application on Azure Active Directory and enables read-only or read-write access to your Azure subscription.

[NOTE]
====
Azure China workflows do not support the use of Terraform templates.
====
* xref:authorize-prisma-cloud.adoc#json[Using Custom Role JSON]
Using a manually created Custom Role you also have the option to enforce least access privilege to restrict access. To achieve this you will need to manually set up the Prisma Cloud application on Active Directory and Create a Custom Role to authorize access to Azure APIs. 
* xref:authorize-prisma-cloud.adoc#manual[Manually Authorizing Prisma Cloud]
If your organization restricts the use of Terraform scripts, you can choose to manually create the required Azure resources for Prisma Cloud to call the Azure APIs.
