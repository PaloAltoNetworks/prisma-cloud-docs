2+|*Azure Flow Logs configuration related issues*

|*Ingest and Monitor Network Security Group Flow Logs* checkbox is checked during onboarding and you are still facing issues with Flow Logs Ingestion.
|*Check whether Azure flow logs are being generated* and written to the storage account:

.. Log in to the Azure portal.

.. Select Storage Accounts and select the storage account that you want to check.

.. Select Blobs > Blob Service and navigate through the folders to find the .json files.
These are the flow logs that Prisma Cloud ingests.

*Check that you have created storage accounts in the same regions as the Network Security Groups*.

Network Security Group (NSG) flow logs are a feature of Network Watcher that allows you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through an NSG. Azure flow logs must be stored within a storage account in the same region as the NSG.

.. Log in to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select *Investigate* and enter the following RQL query:
+
----
network from vpc.flow_record where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs') AND bytes > 0
----
+
This query allows you to list all network traffic from the Internet or from Suspicious IP addresses with over 0 bytes of data transferred to a network interface on any resource on any cloud environment.

*Verify that you have enabled Network Watcher instance*.

The Network Watcher is required to generate flow logs on Azure.

.. Log in to the Azure portal and select menu:Network{sp}Watcher[Overview] and verify that the status is *Enabled*.

.. Log in to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select *Investigate* and enter the following RQL query:
+
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-nsg-list' addcolumn pr provisioningState
----

*Check that you have enabled flow logs on the NSGs*.

.. Log in to the Azure portal, and select menu:Network{sp}Watcher[NSG Flow Logs] and verify that the status is *Enabled*.

.. Log in to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select *Investigate* and enter the following RQL query:
+
----
network from vpc.flow_record where source.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs') AND bytes > 0
----
+
This query allows you to list all network traffic from the Internet or from Suspicious IP addresses with over 0 bytes of data transferred to a network interface on any resource on any cloud environment.
