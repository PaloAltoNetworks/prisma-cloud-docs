== Add an Azure Active Directory Tenant on Prisma Cloud

Add your Azure Active Directory commercial tenant on Prisma Cloud to monitor for security violations and enforce compliance.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Azure commercial tenant (without management groups) enables you to ingest your Azure Active Directory metadata for security violations. These onboarding workflows provides you two options for onboarding your Azure Active Directory tenant without management groups: with Terraform to automatically create your Azure resources, or manually using Azure Portal.

=== Add an Azure Active Directory Tenant—Automatic

This workflow uses Terraform to automatically create your Azure Active Directory metadata to onboard to Prisma Cloud for continuous security monitoring.

[.procedure]
. Select Azure as the cloud type to onboard.
+
.. Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add Cloud Account > Azure].

. Configure the initial onboarding options.
+
** *Cloud Account Name*—Enter a descriptive name to represent the cloud account that you will onboard to Prisma Cloud.

** *Onboard*—Select *Azure Tenant* to onboard your Azure AD tenant.

** *Azure Cloud Type*—Select *Commercial* to onboard your Microsoft Azure (Commercial) account.

** *Onboard Azure Management Groups and Subscriptions*—Deselect this option to exclude onboarding management groups and click *Next*.

** Select *Commercial* as the Prisma Cloud type.

. On the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* page, you have the option to enable permissions for the following additional capabilities. Based on your
selection, Prisma Cloud dynamically generates a Terraform template that includes the associated permissions for the Prisma Cloud role. Prisma Cloud Role provides permissions for security capabilities required. By default, the role provides permissions for cloud discovery for resources and workloads, misconfiguration detection, and threat detection.
+
Agentless Workload Scanning and Serverless Function Scanning are enabled by default. Workload Discovery is also automatically enabled to help you identify all the cloud-native services used on your cloud account. By default, the Prisma Cloud role is granted the appropriate https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/azure-onboarding-checklist#id04489406-4377-448f-8d6c-d1623dcce1e7[permissions] to monitor your cloud account.
+

+
* Enable and add permissions for  *Agentless Workload Scanning* to scan hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a Defender. Scans start automatically once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Agentless scans.

* Enable and add permissions for *Serverless Function Scanning*  to scan cloud provider functions like AWS Lambda, Azure and Google functions for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[vulnerabilities] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/compliance/serverless[compliance]. Scans are automatically initiated once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Serverless scans. 

* Add permissions needed for *Agent-Based Workload Protection*. The permissions allow for automated deployment of Defenders to  provide protection to secure cloud https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[VMs], containers and Kubernetes orchestrators. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits and other features required by defenders are also enabled.

* Enable https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/add-a-new-azure-account-pcds[Data Security] to scan your resources to prevent data leaks. This is not enabled by default. After you onboard your account, further configuration is required to enable data scans.

* Enable *Remediation* to address policy violations reported for remediable Configuration policies on Prisma Cloud. This is not enabled by default. When enabled, the Prisma Cloud role gets read-write access permissions to your Azure cloud account to successfully execute remediation commands.
+
Once your Azure account is onboarded on Prisma Cloud, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans. You can also review the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/azure-commercial-permissions-security-coverage.txt[permissions] required for individual security capabilities. 
. Enter your Azure application data into Prisma Cloud.
+
Enter the following Azure application details:
+
** *Application (Client) ID*—A public identifier for your app registration.

** *Application Client Secret*—A secret string that the app uses to prove its identity when requesting a token. Also can be referred to as the application password.

** *Enterprise Application Object ID*—A unique value for the enterprise application.
+
.. Download the Terraform script from the Prisma Cloud user interface.

.. Log in to https://shell.azure.com[Azure shell].

.. Upload the Terraform script to Azure portal by clicking the *Upload/Download* files button in the Azure CLI. 

.. Run the following Terraform commands:
+
***  userinput:[terraform init] 

***  userinput:[terraform apply] 

*** Copy the *Application (Client) ID*, *Application Client Secret*, and *Enterprise Application Object ID* to a secure location on your computer.

.. Grant admin consent.
+
*** Click on the varname:[e_consent_link] link which will redirect you to the *API permissions* section in Azure portal.
+
image::add-azure-comm-step-2-1.png[scale=30]

*** Click *Grant admin consent for Default Directory* and select *Yes*.
+
A success message should appear with the text *grant consent successful*.
*** Verify that the status column has green check marks.

.. Enter your *Application (Client) ID*, *Application Client Secret*, and *Enterprise Application Object ID* details into the Prisma Cloud UI and click *Next*.

. Add account groups.
+
Select the *Account Groups* you want to add and click *Next*. You must assign each cloud account to an account group, and to associate the account group with it to generate alerts when a policy violation occurs.

. Click *Save*.

=== Add an Azure Active Directory Tenant—Manual
Add your Azure Active Directory commercial tenant on Prisma Cloud to monitor the metadata for security violations and enforce compliance using the manual workflow.

This uses the manual workflow of registering an app in Azure portal and connecting it to Prisma Cloud using APIs—this enables you to ingest your Azure Active Directory metadata so that you can monitor it for security violations.

[.procedure]
. Select Azure as the cloud type to onboard.
+
.. Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add Cloud Account > Azure].

. Configure the initial onboarding options.
+
** *Cloud Account Name*—Enter a descriptive name to represent the cloud account that you will onboard to Prisma Cloud.

** *Onboard*—Select *Azure Tenant* to onboard your Azure AD tenant.

** *Azure Cloud Type*—Select *Commercial* to onboard your Microsoft Azure (Commercial) account.

** *Onboard Azure Management Groups and Subscriptions*—Deselect this option to exclude onboarding management groups and click *Next*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you leave *Onboard Azure Management Groups and Subscription* enabled, you will need to add the Reader role permission at the Root Management Group level for the app registration during onboarding.
====
** Under Cloud type, select *Commercial*.
