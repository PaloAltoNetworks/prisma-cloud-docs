== Add an Azure Active Directory Tenant on Prisma Cloud

Add your Azure Active Directory commercial tenant on Prisma Cloud to monitor for security violations and enforce compliance.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Azure commercial tenant (without management groups) enables you to ingest your Azure Active Directory metadata for security violations. These onboarding workflows provides you two options for onboarding your Azure Active Directory tenant without management groups: with Terraform to automatically create your Azure resources, or manually using Azure Portal.
