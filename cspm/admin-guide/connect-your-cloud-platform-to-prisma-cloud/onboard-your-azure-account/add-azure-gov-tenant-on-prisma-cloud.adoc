== Add an Azure Government Tenant on Prisma Cloud
Learn how to onboard your Azure Government tenant with and without management groups on Prisma Cloud to monitor and secure your Azure government resources.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Azure government tenant allows you to monitor your Azure government resources for security violations. You have the option to onboard Azure government accounts with management groups for more granular monitoring or without management groups.

=== Add an Azure Government Tenant With Management Groups

This workflow deploys your Azure government resources with management groups to Prisma Cloud to facilitate organization into a logical hierarchy for granular monitoring and alerting.

[.procedure]
. Select Azure as the cloud type to onboard.
+
.. Select menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Add Cloud Account > Azure].

. Configure the initial onboarding options.
+
* *Cloud Account Name*—Enter a descriptive name to represent the cloud account that you will onboard to Prisma Cloud.
* *Onboard*—Select *Azure Tenant*.
* *Azure Cloud Type*—Select *Government* to onboard your Microsoft Azure (Government) account.
* *Onboard Azure Management Groups and Subscriptions*—Keep this option selected to include onboarding management groups.

. On the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* page, you have the option to enable permissions for the following additional capabilities. Based on your
selection, Prisma Cloud dynamically generates a Terraform template that includes the associated permissions for the Prisma Cloud role. Prisma Cloud Role provides permissions for security capabilities required. By default, the role provides permissions for cloud discovery for resources and workloads, misconfiguration detection, and threat detection.  
+
Agentless Workload Scanning and Serverless Function Scanning are enabled by default. Workload Discovery is also automatically enabled to help you identify all the cloud-native services used on your cloud account. By default, the Prisma Cloud role is granted the appropriate https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/azure-onboarding-checklist#id04489406-4377-448f-8d6c-d1623dcce1e7[permissions] to monitor your cloud account.

* Enable and add permissions for  *Agentless Workload Scanning* to scan hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a Defender. Scans start automatically once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Agentless scans.

* Enable and add permissions for *Serverless Function Scanning*  to scan cloud provider functions like AWS Lambda, Azure and Google functions for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[vulnerabilities] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/compliance/serverless[compliance]. Scans are automatically initiated once an account is onboarded. You can also update the scanning https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts[configuration] for Serverless scans.

* Add permissions needed for *Agent-Based Workload Protection*. The permissions allow for automated deployment of defenders to  provide protection to secure cloud https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/auto_defend_host[VMs], containers and Kubernetes orchestrators. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits and other features required by defenders are also enabled.

* Enable https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/add-a-new-azure-account-pcds[Data Security] to scan your resources to prevent data leaks. This is not enabled by default. After you onboard your account, further configuration is required to enable data scans.
+
Once your Azure account is onboarded on Prisma Cloud, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans. You can also review the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/azure-government-permissions-security-coverage[permissions] required for individual security capabilities.

. Configure account.
+
Enter the *Directory (Tenant) ID*, *Application (Client) ID*, *Application Client Secret,* and *Enterprise Application Object ID* into the Prisma Cloud UI.
+
* (tt:[Optional]) *Enable Network Security Flow Logs*—If you want to view NSG flow logs on Prisma Cloud, ensure that *Ingest and Monitor Network Security Group Flow Logs* is selected.
+
If *Ingest and Monitor Network Security Group Flow Logs* is selected on Prisma Cloud, authenticate into Azure portal and complete the following steps:
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal#enable-network-watcher[Enable Network Watcher and register Insights provider].
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal[Create a storage account on Azure] for NSG flow logs.
+
Your Azure storage account stores the flow logs that are required for Prisma Cloud to monitor and analyze network traffic. When Prisma Cloud ingests the data in these logs, you can interact with the information in Prisma Cloud. For example, you can run queries against the data, visualize network topology, and investigate traffic flows between two instances. You can also apply network policies to this traffic.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not have regulatory guidelines that specify a log retention period to which you must adhere, we recommend you set retention to at least 15 days.
