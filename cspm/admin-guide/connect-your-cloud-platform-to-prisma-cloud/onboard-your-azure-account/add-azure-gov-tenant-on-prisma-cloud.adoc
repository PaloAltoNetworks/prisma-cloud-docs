== Add an Azure Government Tenant on Prisma Cloud
Learn how to onboard your Azure Government tenant with and without management groups on Prisma Cloud to monitor and secure your Azure government resources.

Connecting Prisma™ Cloud to your Azure government tenant enables you to ingest your cloud resources and configurati-on metadata so that Prisma Cloud can monitor your Azure government resources for security violations. There are two workflows for onboarding Azure government: with management groups which enables you to organize your Azure resources into a logical hierarchy for more granular monitoring, and without management groups.

. Configure account.
+
Enter the *Directory (Tenant) ID*, *Application (Client) ID*, *Application Client Secret,* and *Enterprise Application Object ID* into the Prisma Cloud UI.
+
* (tt:[Optional]) *Enable Network Security Flow Logs*—If you want to view NSG flow logs on Prisma Cloud, ensure that *Ingest and Monitor Network Security Group Flow Logs* is selected.
+
image::azure-onboarding-ingest-and-monitor-nsgs.png[scale=60]
+
If *Ingest and Monitor Network Security Group Flow Logs* is selected on Prisma Cloud, authenticate into Azure portal and complete the following steps:
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal#enable-network-watcher[Enable Network Watcher and register Insights provider].
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal[Create a storage account on Azure] for NSG flow logs.
+
Your Azure storage account stores the flow logs that are required for Prisma Cloud to monitor and analyze network traffic. When Prisma Cloud ingests the data in these logs, you can interact with the information in Prisma Cloud. For example, you can run queries against the data, visualize network topology, and investigate traffic flows between two instances. You can also apply network policies to this traffic.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not have regulatory guidelines that specify a log retention period to which you must adhere, we recommend you set retention to at least 15 days.

. Add account groups.
+
Navigate to the Prisma Cloud UI and select the *Account Groups* you want to add and click *Next*.You must assign each cloud account to an account group, and to associate the account group with it to generate alerts when a policy violation occurs.

. Verify the *Status* and *Done* to save your changes.

[NOTE]
====
If Prisma Cloud is able to validate the credentials by making an authentication call using the credentials provided in the previous step, it displays a green check mark.
