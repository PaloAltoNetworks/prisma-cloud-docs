== Connect Your Cloud Platform to Prisma Cloud

To begin monitoring the resources on your cloud infrastructure, you must first connect your public cloud accounts to Prismaâ„¢ Cloud.

When you onboard your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between your cloud infrastructure provider and Prisma Cloud is established and you can begin monitoring the resources and identify potential security risks in your infrastructure. Once the onboarding process is complete, Prisma Cloud will start collecting and analyzing data from your cloud environments and provide you with insights and recommendations to improve your security posture.
