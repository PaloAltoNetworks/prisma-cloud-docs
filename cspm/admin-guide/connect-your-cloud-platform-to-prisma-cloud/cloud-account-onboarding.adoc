== Cloud Account Onboarding
Learn about the options for adding your cloud accounts on Prisma™ Cloud.

Prisma Cloud provides comprehensive security and compliance coverage to secure your cloud accounts and comply with various industry standards. With a simplified onboarding experience you can adapt to your organization's security priorities in a streamlined manner with the security capabilities grouped as *Foundational* and/or *Advanced*  (with a few enabled by default). Use the *Foundational* capabilities during the start of your organization's cloud adoption journey to effectively manage assets in the cloud and on-premises. Use the *Advanced* capabilities to proactively control your cloud operations and identify and remediate issues before they manifest within your runtime environments.

To get the most out of your investment in Prisma Cloud, you must onboard your cloud accounts. The onboarding process requires that you have the correct permissions on Prisma Cloud and your cloud accounts to authenticate and authorize the connection and retrieval of data. Prisma Cloud administrators with the System Administrator and Cloud Provisioning Administrator roles can use the cloud account onboarding guided tour for a good first-run experience with all supported cloud platforms—Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Service, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 

When you log in to Prisma Cloud for the first-time, the guided tour displays after the welcome tour and prompts you to select a cloud platform to add to Prisma Cloud. You will make a few choices and provide basic account details to retrieve configuration logs and get started with Prisma Cloud for monitoring and visibility. If you want to ingest data from event logs and flow logs, you need to perform additional tasks.
