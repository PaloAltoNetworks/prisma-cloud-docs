== Cloud Account Onboarding
Learn about the options for adding your cloud accounts to Prisma™ Cloud.

To get the most out of your investment in Prisma™ Cloud, you first need to add your cloud accounts to Prisma Cloud. This process requires that you have the correct permissions to authenticate and authorize the connection and retrieval of data.

Prisma Cloud administrators with the System Administrator and Cloud Provisioning Administrator roles can use the cloud account onboarding guided tour for a good first-run experience with all supported cloud platforms—Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The workflow provides the context you need to make decisions based on your own security and compliance requirements and it uses automation scripts—Cloud Formation templates for AWS and Terraform templates for Azure and GCP—to create the custom roles and enable the permissions required to add a cloud account.

When you log in to Prisma Cloud for the first-time, the guided tour displays after the welcome tour and prompts you to select a cloud platform to add to Prisma Cloud.

You will make a few choices and provide basic account details to retrieve configuration logs and get started with Prisma Cloud for monitoring and visibility. If you want to ingest data from event logs and flow logs, you need to perform additional tasks.
