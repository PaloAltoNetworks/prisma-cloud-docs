== Integrate Prisma Cloud with PagerDuty
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with PagerDuty to see alerts in your service or application.

Integrate Prisma™ Cloud with PagerDuty to aid alerting, on-call scheduling, escalation policies, and incident tracking to increase uptime of your apps, servers, websites, and databases. When integrated, Prisma Cloud sends alerts to the PagerDuty service so that your incident response teams are notified to investigate and remediate the security incidents.
