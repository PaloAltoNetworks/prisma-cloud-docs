== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Microsoft Teams
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Microsoft Teams.

Microsoft Teams is a cloud-based team collaboration software that is part of the Office 365 suite of applications and is used for workplace chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration.

Prisma™ Cloud integrates with Microsoft Teams and monitors your assets and sends alerts on resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities either as they happen or as a consolidated summary card—determined by how you configure alert notifications. Each alert message is a webhook notification that includes details such as the cloud type, policy name, and the resource that triggered the alert and the message card indicates the severity with a red (high), yellow (medium) or gray (low) line for easy scanning
+++<draft-comment>I don’t think “easy scanning” is what we want to say but I’m struggling to come up with a more appropriate word. I was initially thinking “for accelerated assessment” but I don’t think that sounds right, either. Maybe “to help you quickly identify high severity alerts” or “quickly assess alert severity?”</draft-comment>+++.




[.procedure]
. Set up Microsoft Teams to view alert notifications from Prisma Cloud.
+
You must create an https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/connectors/connectors-using#setting-up-a-custom-incoming-webhook[incoming webhook connector] on a new channel or on a pre-existing channel on Microsoft Teams to enable the integration with Prisma Cloud. This webhook channel helps consolidate alert notifications from Prisma Cloud in Microsoft Teams so that your operations team can review and take action on the alerts. To enable this integration, you must have administrative privileges or contact the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/enable-features-office-365?redirectSourcePath=%252farticle%252fAdministrator-settings-for-Microsoft-Teams-3966a3f5-7e0f-4ea9-a402-41888f455ba2[Microsoft 365 administrator] who manages Team settings for your organization.
+
.. In Microsoft Teams, click *More options (...)* next to the channel name and select *Connectors*.

.. Scroll to *Incoming Webhook*, *Add* a webhook, and *Install* it.

.. Enter a name for the webhook and *Create* it.

.. Copy the webhook URL to the clipboard and save it before you click *Done*.



. Set up Microsoft Teams on Prisma Cloud.
+
.. Log in to Prisma Cloud.

<<<<<<< HEAD
.. Select "Settings > Integrations".
=======
.. Select menu:Settings[Integrations].
>>>>>>> a48f563acd19a503f35c9d080d1ddbd8d19acc9b

.. *+Add New* integration.

.. Set *Microsoft Teams* as the *Integration Type*.

.. Enter the *Integration Name* , optionally, a *Description* +++<draft-comment>I think including “, optionally,” here is good since it appears the description is not required but, then, we should add this to the other topics in this integration map, as well (this step occurs in most of them) or leave it out here--up to you. =)</draft-comment>+++ .

.. Paste the *Webhook URL* that you previously copied from Microsoft Teams

.. *Test* and then *Save*.
