== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon S3
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Amazon S3.

Amazon S3 is widely used for storage and staging data. You can integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon S3 to get notifications for configuration, audit, and anomaly policy violations.

Using this integration, you can stream the Prisma Cloud alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket or folder. You can also decide how often the notifications should be published to the S3 bucket using *File Roll Up Time*.


[NOTE]
====
This integration is supported only on alerts 2.0-enabled tenants.
====



[.procedure]
. Configure Amazon S3 to receive Prisma Cloud alerts.
+
.. Log in to the AWS management console and select S3.
+
* Create an S3 bucket in your preferred region.

* (Optional) Create a folder. If the desired bucket or folder path already exists, you can skip this step.

.. Select IAM and create a role for Prisma Cloud to be able to write notifications to the S3 bucket.
+
* Create a new policy with the *s3:PutObject* permission for the bucket you created in Step 1. The policy document should be similar to:

+
[NOTE]
====
Do not use PutObject permission on all buckets as it may generate an alert on the Prisma Cloud console.
====

* To configure multiple S3 integrations with multiple buckets, the policy document should be similar to:

* Create an IAM role with the following configurations:

* Select type of trusted entity *Another AWS Account*.
+
Enter the Account ID* *188619942792*. In case of AWS Gov accounts, enter the Account ID* *342570144056*.

* Configure the *External ID* for IAM role. The External ID associated with the IAM role must be a UUID in a 128-bit format, and not any random string. If you’re using the Prisma Cloud web console, click *Generate Token* to generate the External ID while adding the S3 integration. If you’re using the Prisma Cloud API, you must manually create the External ID.
