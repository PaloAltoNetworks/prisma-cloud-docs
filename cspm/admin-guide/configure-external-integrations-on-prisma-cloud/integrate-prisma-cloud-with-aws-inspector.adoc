== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Amazon Inspector
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Amazon Inspector.

Prisma™ Cloud ingests vulnerability data and security best practices deviations from Amazon Inspector to provide organizations with additional context about risks in the cloud.
+++<draft-comment>I wanted to change the next sentence to say “...traffic traveling to (or toward) sensitive workloads...” but not sure that’s right, either. Is a database truly an example of “a sensitive workload?” Can we chat so I can understand this one better?Thanks!</draft-comment>+++You can identify suspicious traffic to sensitive workloads, such as databases with known vulnerabilities.




[.procedure]
. Enable Amazon Inspector on your EC2 instances. To set up Amazon Inspector, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/set-up-amazon-inspector/[Amazon documentation].

. Enable read-access permissions to Amazon Inspector on the IAM Role policy.
+
The Prisma Cloud IAM Role policy that you use to onboard your AWS setup needs these permissions:
+
screen:[inspector:Describe*, ] screen:[inspector:List*]If you used the CFT templates to onboard your AWS account, the Prisma Cloud IAM Role policy already has the permissions required for Amazon Inspector.

. After the Prisma Cloud service begins ingesting Amazon Inspector data, you can use the following RQL queries for visibility into the host vulnerability information collected from it.
