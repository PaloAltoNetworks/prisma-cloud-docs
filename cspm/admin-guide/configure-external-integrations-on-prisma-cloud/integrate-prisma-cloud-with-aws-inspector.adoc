== Integrate Prisma Cloud with AWS Inspector
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with AWS Inspector.

Prisma™ Cloud ingests vulnerability data and security best practices deviations from AWS Inspector to provide organizations with additional context about risks in the cloud.
+++<draft-comment>I wanted to change the next sentence to say “...traffic traveling to (or toward) sensitive workloads...” but not sure that’s right, either. Is a database truly an example of “a sensitive workload?” Can we chat so I can understand this one better?Thanks!</draft-comment>+++You can identify suspicious traffic to sensitive workloads, such as databases with known vulnerabilities.

. Enable AWS Inspector on your EC2 instances. To set up AWS Inspector, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/set-up-amazon-inspector/[Amazon documentation].

. Enable read-access permissions to AWS Inspector on the IAM Role policy.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Prisma Cloud IAM Role policy that you use to onboard your AWS setup needs these permissions:

. After the Prisma Cloud service begins ingesting AWS Inspector data, you can use the following RQL queries for visibility into the host vulnerability information collected from AWS Inspector.
