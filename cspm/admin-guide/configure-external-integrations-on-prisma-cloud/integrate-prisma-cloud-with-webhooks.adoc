== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Webhooks
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with webhooks to see alerts in your service or application.

Integrate Prisma™ Cloud with webhooks to send Prisma Cloud alerts to webhooks and pass information to any third-party integrations that are not natively supported on Prisma Cloud. Your incident response teams can monitor the webhook channels to investigate and remediate security incidents. With a webhook integration, you can configure Prisma Cloud to send information to the webhook as an HTTP POST request as soon as an alert is generated. You can also modify the key format and value associated in the alert payload. If you have internal services or applications that subscribe to the webhook, these subscribing clients receive the alert data in a JSON format.



[.procedure]
. Obtain your *Webhook URL*.
+
If you have additional details that you want to include in the payload to enable additional security or to verify the authenticity of the request, you can include these as key-value pairs in a custom header.

. Set up webhooks as an integration channel on Prisma Cloud.
+
If you have a firewall or cloud Network Security Group between the internet and webhooks, you need to ensure network reachability and xref:../get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.adoc#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-b074-063158eeec08[Enable Access to the Prisma Cloud Console].
