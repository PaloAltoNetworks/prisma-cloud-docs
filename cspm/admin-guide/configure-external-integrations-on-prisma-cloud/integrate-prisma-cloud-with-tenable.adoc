== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Tenable
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Tenable.

Prisma™ Cloud ingests vulnerability data from Tenable to provide you with additional context about risks in the cloud. This integration enables you to, for example, identify suspicious traffic to sensitive workloads, such as databases with known vulnerabilities.

AWS, Azure, and GCP clouds support the Prisma Cloud integration with Tenable.




[.procedure]
. Tenable.IO provides API access to assets and their vulnerability information. Configure the Tenable account to use the Tenable AWS, Azure, and GCP connectors. Without connectors, you cannot identify the cloud resource.
+
The Tenable API requires an access key and secret key in the header. Generate an access key and secret key per user on the Tenable.io app. (See https://cloud.tenable.com/api#/authorization[Tenable documentation] for information.) Also, make sure that the Tenable role that you use to enable this integration has administrator permissions that include vulns-request-export and assets-request-export API access.

. Set up Tenable integration on Prisma Cloud.
+
.. Select "Settings > Integrations".

.. "Add Integration > Tenable". A modal wizard opens where you can add the Tenable integration.

.. Enter *Name* and *Description*.

.. Enter the *Access Key* and the *Secret Key* that are generated in Tenable.io.
+
See https://cloud.tenable.com/api#/authorization[Tenable documentation] for information.

.. Click *Next* and *Test* the integration.Review the Summary and *Save* the integration.



. View vulnerabilities detected by Tenable in Prisma Cloud.
+
.. After Prisma Cloud has access to the Tenable findings, you can use the following RQL queries for visibility into the host vulnerability information collected from Tenable.
+

+++<draft-comment>Shouldn’t “Config Query” and “Network Query” be in bulleted list?</draft-comment>+++

*Config Query*  screen:[config from cloud.resource where finding.type = 'Host Vulnerability' AND finding.source = 'Tenable' AND finding.severity = 'high' ]

Click *Host Findings* to see details.
