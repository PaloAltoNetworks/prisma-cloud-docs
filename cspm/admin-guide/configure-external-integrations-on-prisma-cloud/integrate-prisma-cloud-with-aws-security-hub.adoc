== Integrate Prisma Cloud with AWS Security Hub
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with AWS Security Hub so that you can view and monitor your security posture on AWS Security Hub.

You can use AWS Security Hub as a central console to view and monitor the security posture of your cloud assets on AWS Security Hub.

Integrate Prisma™ Cloud with AWS Security Hub for centralized visibility into security and compliance risks associated with your cloud assets on the AWS Security Hub console.

As part of the integration, Prisma Cloud monitors your assets on your AWS cloud and sends alerts about resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities directly to the AWS Security Hub console so that you have a comprehensive view of the cloud assets deployed on your AWS accounts.
