== Adoption Advisor

Review your adoption of Prisma Cloud, and identify the recommended tasks for your adoption journey.

The Adoption Advisor provides visibility in to how much of the Prisma Cloud capabilities you have adopted, helps you uncover security capabilities that you have not yet explored so that you can make the most of your investment, and provides guidance on where to take action.

The Adoption Advisor focuses on the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), and Cloud Code Security (CCS) capabilities on Prisma Cloud. It groups the tasks into three areas—Foundations, Advanced, and Optimize— and outlines what you should complete for maintaining good security hygiene in a particular area and managing risk as you adopt the cloud for critical infrastructure. As you complete more tasks, the *Adoption Progress* indicator depicts the percentage completed. For enabling CCS capabilities on Adoption Advisor, make sure that the CCS subscription is activated.

The Adoption Advisor also includes Identity and Access Management (IAM) checks and Data Security checks. For completing these checks, the Data Security and IAM Security subscription must be activated.

The IAM Security  checks provide governance and visibility into the entitlements—various permissions and policies— across your cloud resources.

The Data Security checks help you address the challenge of discovering and protecting data stored in your public cloud storage buckets.

|DESCRIPTION


|*Adoption Progress*
|Depicts how well your team has been using the full complement of Prisma Cloud capabilities. This percentage is a ratio of the number of tasks completed divided by the total number of tasks available to you. As your cloud footprint grows, use the Adoption Advisor to identify where to focus on your journey to strengthen your cloud security posture.


|*Anomalous Threats Detected*
|Anomalous Threats Detected are organized by UEBA and Network-based anomaly alerts and policies. The top row displays the number of threats detected for UEBA and Network for the past 30/60/90 days. The bottom row displays the number of enabled vs. possible policies.


|*Discovered vs Secured Resources*
|Displays the extent to which the Defender is currently protecting your cloud environment. It shows the number of resources detected by Cloud Discovery as well as the number of Secured resources protected by deployed Defenders over a period of time.


|*High Risk Assets & Alerts*
|Displays the count of high severity risks detected for all policy violations such as Network, Anomaly, Audit Event, and Config policies by a tenant and the assets producing these alerts over a period of time. It also shows you the Alert Remediation count that includes remediation action states of resolve, dismiss or snooze.


|*Incident Burndown*
|Displays the alerts generated from Network, Anomaly, and Audit Event against the assets across your monitored cloud environments and your team’s progress on remediating these incidents. The remediation actions include the states of resolve, dismiss or snooze.
