== Adoption Advisor

// Review your adoption of Prisma Cloud, and identify the recommended tasks for your adoption journey.

Adoption Advisor provides guidance through the three stages of the code to cloud application lifecycle: Code & Build, Deploy, and Run. It helps you navigate the Foundational, Intermediate, and Advanced tasks at each stage of the application lifecycle, and adopt the security capabilities at your own pace. 

* Foundational – Your organization has started its cloud adoption journey. You are presented with the challenge of effectively managing assets within the cloud and on-premises. Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition provides your organization with the visibility, tools, and knowledge to develop a strong and secure cloud adoption foundation. 

* Intermediate – As you progress with understanding and adopting cloud-based technologies beyond the traditional infrastructure as a service (IaaS) architecture, Prisma Cloud enables you to effectively manage the vulnerabilities and compliance of your cloud resources. 

* Advanced – Use Prisma Cloud to proactively control your cloud operations, and identify and remediate issues before they manifest within your runtime environments. In this phase, your organization is innovating its business with the cloud, and this is supported by the industry-leading capabilities of Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition.

The *Adoption Advisor* includes all the security capabilties available from the different subscriptions that include Visibility,.Compliance, Governbance (VCG), Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), and Cloud Code Security (CCS), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Data Security capabilities on Prisma Cloud. For completing some of these checks, the subscription must be activated first. 

Use the Adoption Advisor for visibility on how much of the security capabilities you have adopted, uncover security capabilities that you have not yet explored so that you can make the most of your investment, and for guidance on where to take action for maintaining good security hygiene in a particular area and managing risk as you adopt the cloud for critical infrastructure. As you complete the recommended tasks, the *Adoption Progress* indicator depicts your progress as a percentage. 

//The IAM Security  checks provide governance and visibility into the entitlements—various permissions and policies— across your cloud resources.

//The Data Security checks help you address the challenge of discovering and protecting data stored in your public cloud storage buckets.
