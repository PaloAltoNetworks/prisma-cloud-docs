== Add Service Accounts On Prisma Cloud
Enable access to the Prisma Cloud APIs for non-human entities.

Service Accounts can be created for automation use cases to enable a nonhuman entity to interact programmatically with the Prisma Cloud APIs. Service accounts differ from user accounts in that they do not need an email address associated with them and do not need to be validated or activated in an external system before they can be used.




[.procedure]
. Navigate to menu:Settings[Access Control] and select menu:Add[Service Account].
+
You must have the System Administrator role on Prisma Cloud to add a service account; a maximum of 250 service accounts are supported.

. Enter the Service Account details and click *Next*.
+
Think about the data you will enter carefully because the information that’s associated with the service account cannot be modified afterwards.
+

You cannot edit the *Name* or *Roles* for a service account. To modify any of these values, you must delete it and create a new one. Each service account can have a maximum of two access keys; you must create one key when you add the service account, and can add an additional key later.
