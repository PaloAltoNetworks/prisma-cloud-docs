=== Forward Audit Logs

Get ready for security audits by streamlining your workflow and integrating Prisma Cloud audit logs with your existing reporting infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
To minimize noise and log flooding, Prisma Cloud does not forward "Successful login" type audit log messages to external integrations. All other audit log types can be sent to any supported external integration such as Webhook or SQS. For example, the following audit log message will not be forwarded. 

screen:['xxx@paloaltonetworks.com'(with role 'System Admin':'System Admin') logged in via password]

+

+ 
AWS SQS or Webhooks notification channels are available for forwarding audit logs. If you have not already set up an integration, you can *Add Integration*. 

. *Save*.
+
All new audit logs that are generated after you enable the integration will be sent to the channel. You can view the audit logs on *Settings > Audit Logs* on Prisma Cloud.
