== Create and Manage Account Groups on Prisma Cloud

Learn how to create and manage Account groups on Prisma Cloud.

You can use Account Groups to combine access to multiple cloud accounts with similar or different applications that span multiple divisions or business units, so that you can manage administrative access to these accounts from Prisma Cloud.

When you onboard a cloud account to Prisma Cloud, you can assign the cloud account to one or more account groups, and then assign the account group to xref:prisma-cloud-administrator-roles.adoc#id437b5c4a-3dfa-4c70-8fc7-b6d074f5dffc[Prisma Cloud Administrator Roles]. Assigning an account group to an administrative user on Prisma Cloud allows you to restrict access only to the resources and data that pertains to the cloud account(s) within an account group. Alerts on Prisma Cloud are applied at the cloud account group level, which means you can setup separate alert rules and notification flows for different cloud environments. In addition, you also have the ability to create nested account groups which providaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaafaues you more flexibility with mapping out your internal hierarchy.

=== Create an Account Group

[.procedure]
. Select menu:Settings[Account Groups > Add Account Group].

. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for the new Account Group.

. Select the cloud accounts that you want to group together in this account group and click *Save*.
+
These are the list of cloud accounts that you have onboarded and are monitoring on Prisma Cloud. You can also xref:#id7d08b640-c9d6-4d6a-b6b5-313156fb1d5b[nest account groups] so that you can map out your organization in a hierarchal manner.

. Enter the Account IDs for cloud accounts for which you want visibility on *Compute*.
+
For the cloud service providers that are supported on Prisma Cloud Compute, you can add the Account IDs manually, even if you have not onboarded the cloud account and are not using Prisma Cloud for compliance and governance. Adding the account IDs manually enables you to assign these accounts to users for role-based access control on Compute so that they can view data collected from Defenders running on workloads across these cloud service providers on menu:Compute[Radar].
+
You must provide the Account ID, the account name is not a unique identifier and is not used to retrieve information from the cloud service provider.

=== Create Nested Account Groups

Create nested account groups and gain more flexibility in mapping out the internal hierarchy of your organization.

Prisma™ Cloud enables you to nest account groups which provides greater flexibility into how to map out your organization’s internal hierarchy and delegate permissions. A nested account group has one or more account groups that are organized in a parent-child hierarchy. Parents can have a combination of children and directly associated accounts, and they will be able to view all of the assets or alerts of the parent account group and that of their children.

+++<draft-comment>The following diagram contains four letters: varname:[A], varname:[B], varname:[C], and varname:[D] which corresponds to account groups, and five numbers of varname:[1], varname:[2], varname:[3], varname:[4] and varname:[5] which corresponds to the cloud accounts associated with those account groups. In this example, varname:[A] is the root because it’s at the top of the tree structure and can therefore view the data of all of it’s children. Account groups varname:[B], varname:[C], and varname:[D] are parents and can therefore view their children’s data.</draft-comment>+++

+++<draft-comment>For example, if a new role with the name of varname:[aws_cloud_account] is attached to account group varname:[B], then varname:[B] will have access to the data of all its children which are varname:[D], varname:[1], varname:[2], and varname:[3]; this is color-coded in the following diagram: </draft-comment>+++

The following workflow creates an account group and then places it inside of a parent. An account group becomes a child when it is placed inside of a parent.

[NOTE]
====
The (image:child-account-included-in-parent-account-group-admin-guide.png[scale=60]) icon indicates that a child account is already part of another parent. If you choose to include it in the parent account group you are currently creating, it will be moved from the former parent account group to the new one. This may result in alerts being marked as *Resolved*.
