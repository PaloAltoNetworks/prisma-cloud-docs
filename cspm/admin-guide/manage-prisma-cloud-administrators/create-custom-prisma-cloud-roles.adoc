== Create Custom Prisma Cloud Roles
 
Prisma Cloud Roles allow you to specify a wide range of user permissions, including access at various levels to multiple cloud environments, the ability to apply policies, as well as enable interactions with alerts and reports. Use custom roles to limit access to Prisma Cloud functions to a user's job responsibilities. When you create a cloud account, you can assign one or more cloud accounts to an account group and then attach the account group to a custom role. Follow the steps below to create a custom role:
