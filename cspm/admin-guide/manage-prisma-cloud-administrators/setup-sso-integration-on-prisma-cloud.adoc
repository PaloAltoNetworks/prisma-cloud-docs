== Set up SSO Integration on Prisma Cloud

On Prisma Cloud, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using an Identity Provider (IdP) that supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect (OIDC), such as Okta, Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Azure Active Directory (AD), Google, or OneLogin. You can configure only one IdP for all the cloud accounts that Prisma Cloud monitors.
