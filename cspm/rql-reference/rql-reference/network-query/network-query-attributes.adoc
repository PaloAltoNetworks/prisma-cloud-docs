== Network Exposure Query Attributes
Learn about Network Query attributes in RQL using Cloud Network Analyzer.

Prisma Cloud’s cloud network analyzer engine calculates the external exposure of your cloud assets using routing path that exists from *source* to *destination* and the net effectiveness of all network security policies in that network path. You can use userinput:[config from network where] query on the *Investigate* page of the Prisma Cloud administrative console and if the search expression is valid and complete, a green checkmark displays along with your query results.

You can save the searches that you have created in *My Saved Searches*, which enables you to use the same query at a later time, instead of typing the query again. You can also use the saved search to create a policy.

Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. As you use these attributes, the auto-suggestion capability shows the available expressions, and xref:../operators.adoc#id7077a2cd-ecf9-4e1e-8d08-e012d7c48041[Operators] that are applicable for each attribute. In order for the network exposure query to be valid, you need to specify at least one userinput:[source] , one userinput:[dest] (destination), and one userinput:[cloud.type] attribute. You can only use the userinput:[and] operator in the RQL query. Use userinput:[=] to specify a single value and userinput:[in] to specify comma separated value (csv).


[NOTE]
====
Any IP addresses or CIDR that you have not defined as https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/trusted-ip-addresses-on-prisma-cloud.html[Trusted IP Addresses on Prisma Cloud] and are not part of your cloud environment are considered as UNTRUST_INTERNET.
====
*  userinput:[source/dest.network] 
+
Use the userinput:[source/dest.network] attribute to search for all public untrusted Internet IPs. Specify it in an IP CIDR format, such as userinput:[1.2.3.4/32] .

*  userinput:[address.match.criteria] 
+
The userinput:[address.match.criteria] attribute is optional to use in combination with the userinput:[source/dest.network] attribute.
+
You can use a userinput:[full_match] or a userinput:[partial_match] for IP addresses with this criteria. For example:
+
** *full_match*—If you use userinput:[address.match.criteria = 'full_match'] for the IP range 20.0.0.0/24 then the cloud network analyzer engine will look for all host addresses of 20.0.0.0/24 in security policies to match.

** *partial_match*-—If you use userinput:[address.match.criteria = 'partial_match'] for the IP range 20.0.0.0/24 then the cloud network analyzer engine will look for at-least one of host addresses of 20.0.0.0/24 in security policies to match.
+
*Query example:*
+
screen:[config from network where source.network = '20.0.0.0/24' and address.match.criteria = 'partial_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/0:79', 'tcp/81:442', 'tcp/444:65535' )]

*  userinput:[source/dest.resource.type] 
+
Use the userinput:[source/dest.resource.type] attribute to search for true network exposure of a particular resource type, such as an instance, interface, PaaS, or service endpoint.

*  userinput:[source/dest.cloud.type] 
+
Use the userinput:[source/dest.cloud.type] attribute to narrow down your search option to specific clouds.
+
*Query example:*
+
screen:[config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS']

If you do not specify userinput:[source/dest.resource.state] in the query, the RQL query displays both Active and Inactive resources in the result.
+
*Query example:*
+
screen:[config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.resource.state = 'Active']
