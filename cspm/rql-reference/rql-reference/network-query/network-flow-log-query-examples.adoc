|View traffic originating from the Internet & suspicious IPs to resource with Database role.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Suspicious IPs' , 'Internet IPs' ) and dest.resource IN ( resource where role IN ( 'AWS RDS' , 'Database' ) )
----


|Find instances that are accessible over the Internet using insecure ports.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs' ) and protocol = 'TCP' AND dest.port IN ( 21,23,80)
----


|Find hosts with Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities receiving network traffic.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where dest.resource IN ( resource where finding.type IN ( 'Host Vulnerability' ) AND finding.name IN ( 'CVE-2017-5754', 'CVE-2017-5753', 'CVE-2017-5715' ) )  and bytes > 0
----


|Check for traffic categorized as malware of type DDoS, HackingTool, or Worm, originating from the Internet & suspicious IPs that are destined to your cloud assets that are not directly accessible over the Internet.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where src.publicnetwork IN ('Suspicious IPs','Internet IPs') AND dest.resource IN ( resource where role not in ( 'AWS NAT Gateway' , 'AWS ELB' ) ) and protocol not in ( 'ICMP' , 'ICMP6' ) AND threat.source = 'AF' AND threat.tag.group IN ( 'DDoS', 'HackingTool', 'Worm' )
----


|Look for traffic from Internet to any instance outside of Web servers, NAT Gateways or ELBs.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where src.publicnetwork IN ('Suspicious IPs','Internet IPs') AND dest.resource IN ( resource where role not in ( 'AWS NAT Gateway' , 'AWS ELB' ) ) and protocol not in ( 'ICMP' , 'ICMP6' )
----


|Look for source entities which are AWS ELBs with connections to more than 10 unique peer IP addresses, but those peer IPs are not endpoints that function as Databases.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where src.resource IN (RESOURCE WHERE role = ('AWS ELB') AND source.outboundpeers > 10) AND dest.resource IN (RESOURCE WHERE role != ('Database'))
----


|Identify any instances with a private IP address (specified in the CIDR format) that are sending traffic to the Internet.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where cloud.account=account_name AND source.ip IN(172.31.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8) AND dest.publicnetwork IN 'Internet IPs' AND bytes > 0
----
[NOTE]
====
Public IP addresses in the CIDR format cannot be set as a source or destination IP address, or a comma seperated value list.
====


|View whether a list of specified IP addresses are sending traffic to the Internet.
|[userinput]
----
network from vpc.flow_record where cloud.account=account_name AND source.ip IN(52.31.0.0,10.0.8.0) AND dest.publicnetwork IN 'Internet IPs' AND bytes > 0
