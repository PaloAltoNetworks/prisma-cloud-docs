Each attribute allows you to narrow down your search criteria. The auto-suggest feature displays expressions and operators available for each attribute.

* *Source*—an identity that takes action on other cloud resources. A source can be any resource with permissions such as an IAM user, Azure Active Directory user, EC2 instance, Lambda function, and Azure virtual machine.

* *Destination*—any cloud resource on which an action has occurred on or is the target of the action.

* *Granter*—the group, role, or policy that grants permissions to the source to interact with the destination.

For example, an IAM user _(source)_ who can add an entry to a DynamoDB table _(destination)_ using the AWS managed policy of the group _(granter entity)_ to which the user belongs.

//* The source is the IAM user. * The destination is the AWS DynamoDB table. * The granter entity is the AWS IAM group.
//This example was in the G-Docs, I thought it was good to include but never seen an example like this yet in the docs so not sure the right styling for this
The table below lists all the attributes you can use to create IAM queries:
