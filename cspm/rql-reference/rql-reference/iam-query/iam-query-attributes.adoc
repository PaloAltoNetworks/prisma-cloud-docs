== IAM Query Attributes

Learn about IAM Query attributes in RQL.

Review your options when using userinput:[config from iam where] on the *Investigate* tab of the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

Each attribute allows you to narrow down your search criteria. The auto-suggest feature displays expressions and operators available for each attribute.

* *Source*—an identity that takes action on other cloud resources. A source can be any resource with permissions such as an IAM user, Azure Active Directory user, EC2 instance, Lambda function, and Azure virtual machine.

* *Destination*—any cloud resource on which an action has occurred on or is the target of the action.

* *Granter*—the group, role, or policy that grants permissions to the source to interact with the destination.

For example, an IAM user _(source)_ who can add an entry to a DynamoDB table _(destination)_ using the AWS managed policy of the group _(granter entity)_ to which the user belongs.

//* The source is the IAM user. * The destination is the AWS DynamoDB table. * The granter entity is the AWS IAM group.
//This example was in the G-Docs, I thought it was good to include but never seen an example like this yet in the docs so not sure the right styling for this
You can use the following attributes on the IAM query:

screen:[config from iam where dest.cloud.service.name = 'lambda' AND dest.cloud.resource.type = 'function' AND dest.cloud.resource.name = 'my-function']

* *dest.cloud.resource.id*
+
Queries permissions to a specific cloud resource by its ID, such as AWS Lambda function ARN, AWS IAM user ARN, and AWS EC2 instance ARN. The following example lists all effective permissions to the AWS Lambda function:

+
Queries permissions to a specific cloud type such as an IAM user, S3 bucket, or EC2 instance. The following example lists all effective permissions to the AWS Lambda functions:

+
screen:[config from iam where dest.cloud.service.name = 's3' AND dest.cloud.resource.type = 'bucket' AND action.name = 'S3:GetObject']

The CONTAINS ALL operator is also supported for this attribute. With this operator, you can run queries with AND logic in between values. For example, you would run the following query if you want to retrieve only roles that contain all actions X, Y and Z:

screen:[config from iam where action.name CONTAINS ALL ( 'Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform/farmBeats/seasons/write', 'Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform/fields/delete' )]

* *action.lastaccess.days*
+
Displays when a specific permission was actually last used. The following example lists all the effective permissions to get an object from an AWS S3 bucket that was not used more than 90 days ago.
+
screen:[config from iam where dest.cloud.service.name = 's3' AND dest.cloud.resource.type = 'bucket' AND action.name = 'S3:GetObject' and action.lastaccess.days > 90]
+
[NOTE]
====
* Last access information is only logged for successful accesses. If the operation failed, for example due to lack of permissions, then the access information is not logged.
* The number of results displayed for last access destinations is limited to the latest 100 results for a permission.
