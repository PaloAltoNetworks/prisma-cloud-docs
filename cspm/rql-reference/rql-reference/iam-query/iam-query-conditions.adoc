== IAM Query Conditions
The IAM Security module supports conditions which enables you to apply filters to the userinput:[config from iam where] query for more granular results. You can use conditions to minimize the exposure of a resource based policy by making it available only to an organization or specific account, or you can use conditions to minimize the access to a machine (EC2 instances or Lambda functions); for example, if a machine has permissions that are publicly available, you can add a condition to enable actions only to a specific IP address. IAM Security include s the new userinput:[grantedby.cloud.condition] attribute which queries permissions where the policy statement contain/doesn’t contain conditions (See xref:iam-query-attributes.adoc#idd31fd7aa-bbe1-4353-b872-d89d688dfc45[IAM Query Attributes] for full list of IAM attributes). The following example filters all results with the source IP address:

 screen:[config from iam where grantedby.cloud.policy.condition('aws:sourceIP') does not exist] Several operators are supported which gives you more flexibility on how filters are applied:

* != (not equal)

* = (equal)

* does not exist

* exists

* in

* not in

Example userinput:[config from iam where] queries applying conditions along with brief explanations of what they do.
