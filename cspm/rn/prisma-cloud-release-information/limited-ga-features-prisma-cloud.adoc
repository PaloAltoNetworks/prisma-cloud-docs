|*Resource Tag Filter in Asset Inventory*
//RLP-70205 - Possible GA in Q4

|A new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/asset-inventory-resource-tag-filter-lga.pdf[Resource Tag] filter is now available in the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory, which allows you to focus on assets based on the resource tags present. Once you filter based on the Resource Tag, the Asset Inventory will display only the assets that contain the Resource Tags you specified.


|*Resolved Alert Notification to External Integrations*
//RLP-71649, RLP-83106

|The alert notification system is enhanced to send resolved notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow or Jira (integrations that support the state change) when you delete a cloud account or update an alert rule on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  For example, when the cloud account or the alert rule associated with an open alert is deleted, the alert status is updated as resolved on Prisma Cloud and the corresponding resolved notification will be sent to the supported integration channels where the open alert notification was sent.
