|DESCRIPTION

|*Policy Severity Alerts now includes Critical and Informational Alerts*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-80038 Pending confirmation from Satheesh on LGA status</draft-comment>+++

|Policy severity categories will soon include Critical and Informational Alert types. Prisma Cloud provides an out-of-the-box list of policies that trigger the appropriate Alert type if they are violated. Alert types will include Critical and Informational along with the existing High, Medium and Low. This change will be reflected across the Prisma Cloud console in areas such Policies, Compliance, Notifications, Reports etc., that currently reference Policy Severity. 


|*Ingestion of AWS DNS Logs from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose*

tt:[Available on app, app2, and app3 only]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-73690</draft-comment>+++
|DNS logs provide critical data in detecting threats such as, Cryptomining pools, domain generation algorithms (DGAs), and DNS rebinding. Prisma Cloud fetches DNS logs for accounts that are streamed on Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose in a logging account on AWS.

After you enable DNS log ingestion on Prisma Cloud, all requests made to AWS default DNS resolvers are logged while DNS queries made to external servers or DNS servers not managed by AWS are not logged. Logging is enabled per VPC.
