|DESCRIPTION

|*Send Audit Logs to External Integrations*
//RLP-40400, RLP-82355
|Forward audit logs from Prisma Cloud to an external integration that you have configured to integrate with your existing security workflows.

* Select "Settings > Enterprise Settings".
* Enable, *Send Audit Logs to integration*.
* Select the AWS SQS or Webhooks notification channel to send the audit logs.
+
All new audit logs that are generated after you enable the integration will be sent to this channel. You can view the audit logs on "Settings > Audit Logs" on Prisma Cloud.

|*Resolved Alert Notification to External Integrations*
//RLP-71649
|The alert notification system is enhanced to send resolved notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow or Jira (integrations that support the state change) when you delete a cloud account or update an alert rule on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  For example, when the cloud account or the alert rule associated with an open alert is deleted, the alert status is updated as resolved on Prisma Cloud and the corresponding resolved notification will be sent to the supported integration channels where the open alert notification was sent.
