|DESCRIPTION

|*Resource Tag Filter in Asset Inventory*
//RLP-70205

|A new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/asset-inventory-resource-tag-filter-lga.pdf[Resource Tag] filter is now available in the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory, which allows you to focus on assets based on the resource tags present. Once you filter based on the Resource Tag, the Asset Inventory will display only the assets that contain the Resource Tags you specified.

|*Send Audit Logs to External Integrations*
//RLP-40400, RLP-82355
|Forward audit logs from Prisma Cloud to an external integration that you have configured to integrate with your existing security workflows.

* Select "Settings > Enterprise Settings".
* Enable, *Send Audit Logs to integration*.
* Select the AWS SQS or Webhooks notification channel to send the audit logs.
+
All new audit logs that are generated after you enable the integration will be sent to this channel. You can view the audit logs on "Settings > Audit Logs" on Prisma Cloud.

|*Resolved Alert Notification to External Integrations*
//RLP-71649
|The alert notification system is enhanced to send resolved notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow or Jira (integrations that support the state change) when you delete a cloud account or update an alert rule on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  For example, when the cloud account or the alert rule associated with an open alert is deleted, the alert status is updated as resolved on Prisma Cloud and the corresponding resolved notification will be sent to the supported integration channels where the open alert notification was sent.


|*Performance Improvements for Investigate RQL Queries*
//RLP-68326
|The userinput:[config] and userinput:[event] query results on the *Investigate* page are optimized to load the initial set of results significantly faster. To enable faster load times, the backend automatically uses a heuristic search to retrieve search results for your query.
When you enter the query and click *Search*, the interface loads the first 100 search results, and you can use the *Load More* button to fetch more results. The *Get Total Count* button enables you to get a full count of all pertinent results, and is available for eligible queries that include attributes that support the heuristic search only.

The list of attributes supported with heuristic search for userinput:[config] queries are: API Name, Cloud Type, Cloud Service, Cloud Account, Cloud Account Group, Cloud Region, and JSON Rule; and for userinput:[event] queries it is Cloud Type.
