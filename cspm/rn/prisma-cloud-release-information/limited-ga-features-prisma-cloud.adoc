+++<draft-comment>RLP-80038 Pending confirmation from Satheesh on LGA status</draft-comment>+++

|Policy severity categories will soon include Critical and Informational Alert types. Prisma Cloud provides an out-of-the-box list of policies that trigger the appropriate Alert type if they are violated. Alert types will include Critical and Informational along with the existing High, Medium and Low. This change will be reflected across the Prisma Cloud console in areas such Policies, Compliance, Notifications, Reports etc., that currently reference Policy Severity.
