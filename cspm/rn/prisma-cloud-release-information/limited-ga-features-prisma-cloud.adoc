|DESCRIPTION


|*Unified Asset Inventory*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-65170</draft-comment>+++
|A new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/unified-asset-inventory-documentation-lga.pdf[Unified Asset Inventory] provides a consolidated view of assets discovered by Prisma Cloud. You can review all your assets on Prisma Cloud across multi-cloud deployments—public and private cloud environments. Unified Asset Inventory provides new capabilities to identify and prioritize remediation of security issues detected within your monitored environments.

In addition to the assets currently available in Prisma Cloud, Unified Asset Inventory also includes new asset types from Prisma Cloud Compute, including hosts, containers, and container images. You can view this data in a tabular format and search and filter down to specific resources or sets of resources based on your selected filters.

|*Performance Improvements for Investigate RQL Queries*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-68326</draft-comment>+++
|The userinput:[config] and userinput:[event] query results on the *Investigate* page are optimized to load the initial set of results significantly faster. To enable faster load times, the backend automatically uses a heuristic search to retrieve search results for your query.

When you enter the query and click *Search*, the interface loads the first 100 search results, and you can use the *Load More* button to fetch more results. The *Get Total Count* button enables you to get a full count of all pertinent results, and is available for eligible queries that include attributes that support the heuristic search only.

The list of attributes supported with heuristic search for userinput:[config] queries are: API Name, Cloud Type, Cloud Service, Cloud Account, Cloud Account Group, Cloud Region, and JSON Rule; and for userinput:[event] queries it is Cloud Type.


|*Ingestion of AWS DNS Logs from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose*

tt:[Available on app, app2, and app3 only]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-73690</draft-comment>+++
|DNS logs provide critical data in detecting threats such as, Cryptomining pools, domain generation algorithms (DGAs), and DNS rebinding. Prisma Cloud fetches DNS logs for accounts that are streamed on Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose in a logging account on AWS.

After you enable DNS log ingestion on Prisma Cloud, all requests made to AWS default DNS resolvers are logged while DNS queries made to external servers or DNS servers not managed by AWS are not logged. Logging is enabled per VPC.

For more details, refer to the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/aws-dns-log-ingestion-documentation-lga.pdf[AWS DNS Log Ingestion LGA Documentation.]


|*Anomaly Policies for AWS DNS Activity*

tt:[Available on app, app2, and app3 only]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-70974</draft-comment>+++
|On *Policies* and menu:Alerts[Overview], a new *Policy Subtype* for *DNS* displays.

image::dns-policy-page-rn.png[scale=40]

The two new policies that use information in DNS logs for your AWS cloud accounts to detect anomalies are:

* *Cryptomining domain request activity—* detects when monitored resources attempt to contact a known cryptomining pool using DNS protocol to retrieve the IP address of the cryptominer.

* *DGA domain request activity—* detects when monitored resources attempt to resolve domain names in which domain names look like they are generated by an algorithm.

When you enable DNS log ingestion, and add the DNS anomaly policies to an alert rule, alerts for DNS anomaly policies are triggered.

These new anomaly policies generate alerts when they detect suspicious domains in DNS queries. With the addition of these policies, you also have the ability to specify a *Domain Name* in an anomaly trusted list to suppress alerts. For the domain names that are added to this trusted list, the DNS anomaly policies will not generate alerts.
