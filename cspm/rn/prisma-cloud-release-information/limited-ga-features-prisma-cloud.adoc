|*Vulnerabilities displayed in Command Center*
//RLP-89582

|The Command Center dashboard on the Prisma Cloud console now includes a snapshot view of Urgent Vulnerabilities, Top 5 Vulnerable Images, and Top 5 Vulnerable Hosts. Vulnerabilities triggering Critical and High alerts are grouped into these actionable views, giving you insight into the impacted resources in your environment and providing you with remediation options. You can view data for the past 30 days and also filter results by:

* *Time Range* - Viewable for the last day, week, month, or a customized time frame
* *Account Groups*
* *Cloud Accounts*

Currently only System Administrators can view the Vulnerabilities widget.


|*Attack Path Policies*
//RLP-91967

|Prisma Cloud provides 5 new Attack Path policies that are enabled by default (critical severity) to help prioritize alerts and mitigate security issues.

For more information, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/attack-path-policies-lga.pdf[list of policies].


|*Resource Tag Filter in Asset Inventory*
//RLP-70205

|A new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/asset-inventory-resource-tag-filter-lga.pdf[Resource Tag] filter is now available in the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory, which allows you to focus on assets based on the resource tags present. Once you filter based on the Resource Tag, the Asset Inventory will display only the assets that contain the Resource Tags you specified.


|*Resolved Alert Notification to External Integrations*
//RLP-71649

|The alert notification system is enhanced to send resolved notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow or Jira (integrations that support the state change) when you delete a cloud account or update an alert rule on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  For example, when the cloud account or the alert rule associated with an open alert is deleted, the alert status is updated as resolved on Prisma Cloud and the corresponding resolved notification will be sent to the supported integration channels where the open alert notification was sent.
