|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Attack Path Analysis and Visualization*
//RLP-101210

tt:[Only available on app.ca, app.fr, and app.jp]

|Prisma Cloud now includes https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/attack-path-analysis-lga.pdf[attack path analysis and visualization] that identifies attack paths and presents them in a graph view, offering valuable security context to protect against high-risk threats. 

It is an automated process that identifies exposed or vulnerable infrastructure assets, applications, or data by corelating multiple security signals. It indicates the likelihood of a breach, which often requires immediate action. 

To review these policies, select *Policies* and filter by Policy Type *Attack Path*. Additionally, the asset detail view displays the finding types and vulnerabilities.

|*Integrated View of Run and Build details for Alerts*
//RLP-103734 - Must be moved to GA in 23.7.2
|To help you as a Cloud Security Engineer investigate issues from code to cloud, the alert details now include information to trace and attribute which build-time resource has caused a policy violation for a runtime resource deployed in your cloud account. The alert details overview includes the IaC resource details and information on the build time resource. The new Traceability information helps you connect an alert from the production environment back to the origin templates in your upstream development environment.

To view the build-time details in an alert:

* You must enable a Configuration policy with the subtype Run, Build and attach it to an alert rule on Prisma Cloud.

* Your IaC templates must be onboarded through a VCS integration.

* Terraform resources must include the yor_trace tag so that your IaC resources are tagged with a unique UUID for tracing the relationship between the code resource and the runtime resource that is deployed from it. This is not necessary for CloudFormation.

|*Resource Tag Filter in Asset Inventory*
//RLP-70205 - Possible GA in Q4

|A new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/asset-inventory-resource-tag-filter-lga.pdf[Resource Tag] filter is now available in the Prisma Cloud Asset Inventory, which allows you to focus on assets based on the resource tags present. Once you filter based on the Resource Tag, the Asset Inventory will display only the assets that contain the Resource Tags you specified.


|*Resolved Alert Notification to External Integrations*
//RLP-71649, RLP-83106

|The alert notification system is enhanced to send resolved notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow or Jira (integrations that support the state change) when you delete a cloud account or update an alert rule on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.  For example, when the cloud account or the alert rule associated with an open alert is deleted, the alert status is updated as resolved on Prisma Cloud and the corresponding resolved notification will be sent to the supported integration channels where the open alert notification was sent.
