|*Burndown Widgets in Adoption Advisor*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-48543</draft-comment>+++
|The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/adoption-advisor[Adoption Advisor] now includes two new widgets for risk and incident burndown.

These widgets show you the number of high severity misconfigurations or risks and incidents detected in your cloud environment, and your team’s progress on remediating these issues. The count of remediated risks and incidents includes alerts that are in the resolve, dismiss, or snoozed states.

=== New Policies and Policy Updates

See the xref:../look-ahead-planned-updates-prisma-cloud.adoc#ida01a4ab4-6a2c-429d-95be-86d8ac88a7b4[look ahead updates] for planned changes and policy updates in 22.6.1.

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*Azure Virtual Desktop session host is not configured with managed identity*

Identifies Virtual Desktop session hosts that are not configured with managed identity. Managed identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Storing credentials in a code increases the threat surface in case of exploitation and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. So as a security best practice, it is recommended to have the managed identity to your Virtual Desktop session hosts.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-virtual-desktop-session-host' AND json.rule = session-hosts[*] is not empty and session-hosts[*].properties.resourceId exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-vm-list' AND json.rule = powerState equal ignore case "PowerState/running" as Y; filter '$.X.session-hosts[*].properties.resourceId equal ignore case $.Y.id and ($.Y.identity does not exist or $.Y.identity.type equal ignore case None)'; show Y;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-64869</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS IAM Policy permission may cause privilege escalation*

Identifies AWS IAM Policy which have permission that may cause privilege escalation. AWS IAM policy having weak permissions could be exploited by an attacker to elevate privileges. It is recommended to follow the principle of least privileges ensuring that AWS IAM policy does not have these sensitive permissions.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = isAttached is true and document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Action contains iam:CreatePolicyVersion or Action contains iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion or Action contains iam:PassRole or Action contains iam:CreateAccessKey or Action contains iam:CreateLoginProfile or Action contains iam:UpdateLoginProfile or Action contains iam:AttachUserPolicy or Action contains iam:AttachGroupPolicy or Action contains iam:AttachRolePolicy or Action contains iam:PutUserPolicy or Action contains iam:PutGroupPolicy or Action contains iam:PutRolePolicy or Action contains iam:AddUserToGroup or Action contains iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy or Action contains iam:*))] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-63592</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Spring Cloud service is not configured with virtual network*

Identifies Azure Spring Cloud services that are not configured with a virtual network. Spring Cloud configured with a virtual network isolates apps and service runtime from the internet on your corporate network and provides control over inbound and outbound network communications for Azure Spring Cloud. As best security practice, it is recommended to deploy Spring Cloud service in a virtual network.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-spring-cloud-service' AND json.rule = properties.powerState equals Running and sku.tier does not equal Basic and properties.networkProfile.serviceRuntimeSubnetId does not exist
----

|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*GCP Firewall rule allows all traffic on HTTP port (80)*

*Changes—* The RQL is modified to check if the firewall rule is disabled and includes IPv6 check. The remediation CLI is modified to disable the vulnerable firewall rule instead of deleting it.

Additional permissions required:

* screen:[compute.firewalls.update]
* screen:[compute.networks.updatePolicy]

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule= 'sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(80,80) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp)) )] exists'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = disabled is false and direction equals INGRESS and (sourceRanges[*] equals ::0 or sourceRanges[*] equals 0.0.0.0 or sourceRanges[*] equals 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] equals ::/0 or sourceRanges[*] equals ::) and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(80,80) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp)))] exists
----

*Updated CLI—*

----
gcloud compute --project=${account} firewall-rules update ${resourceName} --disabled
----

*Impact—* Low.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS IAM policy overly permissive to Lambda service*

Identifies the IAM policies that are overly permissive to Lambda service. AWS provides serverless computational functionality through their Lambda service. Serverless functions allow organizations to run code for applications or backend services without provisioning virtual machines or management servers. It is recommended to follow the principle of least privileges, ensuring that only restricted Lambda services for restricted resources.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = isAttached is true and document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Action equals lambda:* or Action[*] equals lambda:*) and (Resource equals * or Resource[*] equals *) and Condition does not exist)] exists

----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-64928</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS Lambda function communicating with ports known to mine Monero*

Identifies AWS Lambda function which are communicating with ports known to mine Monero. AWS Lambda functions when infected with Denonia malware installs a XMRig mining software which is used for minning Monero. It is highly recommended to restrict Lambda function to known hosts or services only.

----
network from vpc.flow_record where source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' , 'AWS IPs', 'Azure IPs', 'GCP IPs' ) and protocol IN ( 'TCP' ) and dest.port = 3333 and dest.resource IN ( resource where role IN ( 'AWS Lambda' ) ) and bytes > 0
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-64927</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS RDS PostgreSQL exposed to local file read vulnerability*

Identifies AWS RDS PostgreSQL which are exposed to local file read vulnerability. AWS RDS PostgreSQL installed with vulnerable 'log_fdw' extension is exposed to local file read vulnerability, due to which attacker could gain access to local system files of the database instance within their account, including a file which contained credentials specific to PostgreSQL. It is highly recommended to upgrade AWS RDS PostgreSQL to the latest version.

----

|
|*Azure Recovery Services vault is not configured with managed identity*

Identifies Recovery Services vaults that are not configured with managed identity. Managed identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Storing credentials in a code increases the threat surface in case of exploitation and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. So as a security best practice, it is recommended to have the managed identity to your Recovery Services vault.

|*GCP Firewall rule exposes GKE clusters by allowing all traffic on port 10250*

Identifies GCP Firewall rule allowing all traffic on port 10250 which allows GKE full node access. The port 10250 on the kubelet is used by the kube-apiserver (running on hosts labeled as Orchestration Plane) for exec and logs. As per security best practice, port 10250 should not be exposed to the public.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = disabled is false and direction equals INGRESS and (sourceRanges[*] equals ::0 or sourceRanges[*] equals 0.0.0.0 or sourceRanges[*] equals 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] equals ::/0 or sourceRanges[*] equals ::) and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(10250,10250) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp or IPProtocol contains "all")))] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING as Y; filter '$.X.network contains $.Y.networkConfig.network' ; show X;

|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) is not using the latest predefined security policy*

*Changes—* AWS updated the recommended security policy for network load balancer configured with TLS. Due to this change, the policy RQL, description, and recommendation steps have been updated accordingly.

*Updated Description—* Identifies Network Load Balancers (NLBs) are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. It is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.

It is recommended to use ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-0-2021-06 policy if you require Forward Secrecy (FS) and use ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08 policy to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = 'type equals network and listeners[?any(protocol equals TLS and sslPolicy exists and (sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2020-10 and sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06))] exists'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = state.code equals active and type equals "network" and listeners[?any(protocol equals TLS and sslPolicy exists and sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-0-2021-06 and sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08)] exists
----

*Impact—* Medium. The alerts for resources which had older security policy will be resolved as ‘Policy_Updated’ and new alerts will be created if the security policy for network load balancer configured with TLS is not the same as recommended by AWS.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-62038</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP User managed service accounts have user managed service account keys*

*Changes—* The policy RQL is updated to exclude Prisma-cloud specific service account and the description is modified based on the updated RQL.

*Updated Description—* Identifies user managed service accounts that use user managed service account keys instead of Google-managed. For user-managed keys, the User has to take ownership of key management activities. Even after owner precaution, keys can be easily leaked by common development malpractices like checking keys into the source code or leaving them in downloads directory or accidentally leaving them on support blogs/channels. It is recommended to limit the use of User-managed service account keys and instead use Google-managed keys which can not be downloaded.

[NOTE]
====
This policy might alert the service accounts which are not created using Terraform for cloud account onboarding. These alerts are valid because no user-managed service account should be used for cloud account onboarding.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-iam-service-accounts-keys-list' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-iam-service-accounts-list' as Y; filter '($.X.name contains iam.gserviceaccount.com and $.X.name contains $.Y.email and $.X.keyType contains USER_MANAGED)' ; show X;

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-iam-service-accounts-keys-list' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-iam-service-accounts-list' as Y; filter '($.X.name does not contain prisma-cloud and $.X.name contains iam.gserviceaccount.com and $.X.name contains $.Y.email and $.X.keyType contains USER_MANAGED)' ; show X;
----

*Impact—* Medium. The RQL modification will resolve alerts associated with Prisma-cloud specific service accounts.
