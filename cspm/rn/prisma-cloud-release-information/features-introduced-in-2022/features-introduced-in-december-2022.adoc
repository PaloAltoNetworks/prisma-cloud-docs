|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|tt:[Update] *Asset Inventory*
//RLP-80994, RLP-65170
|An enhanced https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-dashboards/asset-inventory[Asset Inventory] provides a consolidated view of assets discovered by Prisma Cloud. You can review all your assets on Prisma Cloud across multi-cloud deployments—public and private cloud environments. The enhanced Asset Inventory provides new capabilities to identify and prioritize remediation of security issues detected within your monitored environments. 

In addition to the assets currently available in Prisma Cloud, the enhanced Asset Inventory also includes new asset types from Prisma Cloud Compute, including hosts, containers, and container images. You can view this data in a tabular format and search and filter down to specific resources or sets of resources based on your selected filters.

|*Improvement to Flow Logs Ingestion Time*
//RLP-76433

|Prisma Cloud now provides hourly partition for your AWS S3 Flow Logs. By switching to hourly partition, Prisma Cloud makes fewer calls to your S3 bucket thereby reducing cost, solving lag, and provides better ingestion performance over the existing 24-hour partition. 

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Create a new flow log] setting with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required on the AWS console. Some additional fields such as, tcp-flags and flow-direction configured on the AWS console  are used to ensure accuracy of the Internet exposure calculation in network policies.

|*External ID update for AWS Cloud Account Onboarding*

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 22.4.1 release.]

// RLP-60053, RLP-65122, and RLP-64168. Verify and add blurb under REST API section.
// This blurb has been updated again in 22.6.3
// This blurb has been updated in 22.9.1
// Also known as Confused Deputy Attack on AWS Accounts

+++<draft-comment>This blurb was updated in 22.12.1 to Feb 2023 instead of Jan 2023.</draft-comment>+++
|While https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/add-aws-cloud-account-to-prisma-cloud[onboarding AWS standalone or organization accounts] in Prisma Cloud Console, you cannot provide the External ID. Instead, Prisma Cloud generates an External ID and includes it in the IAM Role CFT. You can use this External ID and complete the onboarding process within 30 days. If you do not complete the onboarding within this 30-day period, you must restart the onboarding workflow. 

This change is currently limited to the Prisma Cloud Console and does not impact already onboarded AWS accounts.

You can continue to use the existing cloud account onboarding APIs until the new APIs that use the External ID generated by Prisma Cloud are available (expected in February 2023). After the new APIs are available, you have 90 days to update your automation scripts for onboarding new cloud accounts.

Similarly, the CFTs in the S3 bucket that allow custom External IDs will continue to be available until the end of March 2023 for backward compatibility.

|*Azure Cosmos DB (PaaS) instance reachable from untrust internet source*

|Identifies Azure Cosmos DB (PaaS) instances that are internet reachable from untrust internet source. Cosmos DB (PaaS) instances with untrusted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from untrusted IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

+++<draft-comment>RLP-75166</draft-comment>+++
|*Global Region Support for Google Compute Engine*

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support for screen:[gcloud-compute-instance-template] API. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted once, and then regenerated on the management console.
Existing alerts corresponding to these resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against the policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for screen:[gcloud-compute-instance-template] start ingesting data again.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-74909</draft-comment>+++
|*Region Support for Google Cloud Load Balancing APIs*

|Prisma Cloud can now store regional resources as well as global resources for screen:[gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies] and screen:[gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies] APIs. Due to this, new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice an increased count in the number of alerts for screen:[gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies] and screen:[gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies] APIs.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-80585</draft-comment>+++
|*Alerts for Audit Events*

|To make your experience with audit event alerts consistent with configuration alerts for custom policies, the policy evaluation for audit events is updated to use the alert rule configuration. The targets for the cloud accounts and cloud regions for which you want to trigger alerts are now only inherited from the alert rule.

Earlier, when you run an audit event query on the *Investigate* page, and save the query as a saved search and then use this saved search query as match criteria in a policy, the matched issues that trigger alerts used inputs from both the alert rule configuration and saved search.

As an example, if you had created a saved search that includes the RQL for cloud.account, cloud.accountgroup, or cloud.region, such as userinput:[event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Canada' AND operation IN ('DeleteAccessKey')] the cloud.account, and cloud.region attributes will now be ignored for custom and existing policies and their associated alerts.

Only, the target cloud accounts and cloud regions that you specify in the alert rule configuration will be used to scope when alerts are generated for the custom Audit Event policy.

*Impact—* The change in how the targets for generating alerts scoped may result in a larger number of alerts than before. This change will be rolled out gradually over multiple phases.

=== New Compliance Benchmarks and Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Multi-Level Protection Scheme 2.0 (Level 2)*

//RLP-84998
|Prisma Cloud now supports the Multi-Level Protection Scheme 2.0 (Level 2) compliance standard.
This level of information security is based on the compliance standard that nearly all domestic and foreign companies operating in China must follow.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies On Prisma Cloud's "Compliance > Standard" page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance over time.

|*Secure Controls Framework (SCF) - 2022.2.1 standards*

//RLP-84997
|Prisma Cloud now supports the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) - 2022.2.1 standards.
The Secure Controls Framework (SCF) is a meta-framework that corresponds to more than 100 industry frameworks and laws related to cybersecurity and privacy.

The SCF is concerned with internal controls. These are the cybersecurity and privacy policies, standards, procedures, and other processes designed to provide assurance that business objectives will be met and unwanted events will be prevented, detected, and corrected.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies On Prisma Cloud's "Compliance > Standard" page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance over time.
