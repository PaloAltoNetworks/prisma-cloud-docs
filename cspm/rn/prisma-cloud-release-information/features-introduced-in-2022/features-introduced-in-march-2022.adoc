==== New Policies and Policy Updates
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS IAM Access analyzer is not configured*

Identifies AWS regions that do not have IAM Access Analyzer configured. AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as IAM roles, that are shared with an external entity so that you can identify unintended access to your resources and data. As a best practice, configure Access Analyzer in all regions of your account.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-access-analyzer' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-region' AND json.rule = optInStatus does not equal not-opted-in as Y; filter '$.X.arn contains $.Y.regionName'; show X; count(X) less than 1
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-33433</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Spring Cloud app end-to-end TLS is disabled*

Identifies Azure Spring Cloud apps that have end-to-end TLS disabled. Enabling end-to-end TLS and or SSL will secure traffic from ingress controller to apps. After you enable end-to-end TLS and load a certificate from the key vault, all communications within Azure Spring Cloud are secured with TLS. As a best practice, use end-to-end TLS to secure the traffic from Spring Cloud apps.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-spring-cloud-service' AND json.rule = properties.powerState equals Running and sku.tier does not equal Basic as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-spring-cloud-app' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.enableEndToEndTLS is false as Y; filter '$.X.name equals $.Y.serviceName'; show Y;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-56131</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Spring Cloud app system-assigned managed identity is disabled*

Identifies Azure Spring Cloud apps that have system assigned managed identity disabled. System assigned managed identity can be used to authenticate any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Storing credentials in code increases the threat surface in case of exploitation which managed identities eliminate the need for. As a best practice, assign system managed identity to your Spring Cloud apps.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-spring-cloud-service' AND json.rule = properties.powerState equals Running as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-spring-cloud-app' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and identity does not exist as Y; filter '$.X.name equals $.Y.serviceName'; show Y;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-56130</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP API key not restricted to use by specified Hosts and Apps*

Identifies GCP API keys that are not restricted by any specific hosts or apps. Unrestricted keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides. As a best practice, restrict API key usage to trusted hosts, HTTP referrers, and apps.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-api-key' AND json.rule = (restrictions.browserKeyRestrictions does not exist and restrictions.serverKeyRestrictions does not exist and restrictions.androidKeyRestrictions does not exist and restrictions.iosKeyRestrictions does not exist) or (restrictions.browserKeyRestrictions exists and (restrictions.browserKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedReferrers[*] equals "*")] exists or restrictions.browserKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedReferrers[*] equals "*.[TLD]")] exists or restrictions.browserKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedReferrers[*] equals "*.[TLD]/*")] exists)) or (restrictions.serverKeyRestrictions exists and (restrictions.serverKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedIps[*] equals 0.0.0.0)] exists or restrictions.serverKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedIps[*] equals 0.0.0.0/0)] exists or restrictions.serverKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedIps[*] equals ::/0)] exists or restrictions.serverKeyRestrictions[?any(allowedIps[*] equals ::0)] exists))
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-32020</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—Metadata*
|*Azure Network Watcher Network Security Group (NSG) flow logs are disabled*

*Changes—* The policy recommendation has been updated to include end-to-end configuration information. The policy RQL has also been updated to remove userinput:[$] to be consistent across all RQLs.

*Updated RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-nsg-list' AND json.rule = flowLogsSettings does not exist or flowLogsSettings.enabled is false]

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-60748</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure App Service Web app doesn't have a Managed Service Identity*

*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to exclude user assigned identities App Service from reporting because, App Service can be assigned with user assigned identities. The policy description and recommendation have also been updated to reflect the changes.

*Updated RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = kind starts with app and (identity.type does not exist or (identity.type exists and identity.type does not contain SystemAssigned and identity.type does not contain UserAssigned))]

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts for App Services using user assigned identities will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-57055</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS RDS instance with copy tags to snapshots disabled*

*Changes—* The policy was reporting false positive alerts for AWS DocumentDB instances as the copyTagsToSnapshot feature was not supported for DocDB. The policy RQL has been updated to ignore docdb engine instances.

*Current—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = 'dbinstanceStatus equals available and (copyTagsToSnapshot is false or copyTagsToSnapshot does not exist) and engine does not contain aurora'
----

*Updated to—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = dbinstanceStatus equals available and (copyTagsToSnapshot is false or copyTagsToSnapshot does not exist) and engine does not contain aurora and engine does not contain docdb
----

*Impact—* Alerts for resources that have a docdb engine instance will be resolved to Policy_Updated.

----

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts for resources that are not attached to any user, roles, or groups will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-48630</draft-comment>+++

|*GCP Cloud Function HTTP trigger is not secured*

*Changes—* The RQL has been modified to generate alerts only for HTTP triggers that are not secure.

*Current RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and httpsTrigger.securityLevel does not equal SECURE_ALWAYS]

|CHANGE
|DESCRIPTION


|*CSPM Policy API Endpoints*

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 22.2.2 release.] 
|If you specify an RQL statement rather than a search ID for the *rule.criteria* request body parameter, the value of the *rule.criteria* attribute in the resulting response object will be a UUID and not the RQL itself. This change affects the following API requests:

* userinput:[POST /policy] 
* userinput:[PUT /policy/{id}] 

You can use the UUID with the following requests to determine the corresponding RQL statement:

* userinput:[GET /search/history] 
+
where the response object includes both the UUID and RQL
* userinput:[GET /search/history/{UUID}]
