|DESCRIPTION

|*Unified Asset Inventory*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-65170</draft-comment>+++
|A new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/unified-asset-inventory-documentation-lga.pdf[Unified Asset Inventory] provides a consolidated view of assets discovered by Prisma Cloud. You can review all your assets on Prisma Cloud across multi-cloud deployments—public and private cloud environments. Unified Asset Inventory provides new capabilities to identify and prioritize remediation of security issues detected within your monitored environments.

In addition to the assets currently available in Prisma Cloud, Unified Asset Inventory also includes new asset types from Prisma Cloud Compute, including hosts, containers, and container images. You can view this data in a tabular format and search and filter down to specific resources or sets of resources based on your selected filters.

|*Anomaly Policies for AWS DNS Activity*

tt:[Available on app, app2, and app3 only]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-70974</draft-comment>+++
|On *Policies* and menu:Alerts[Overview], a new *Policy Subtype* for *DNS* displays.

image::dns-policy-page-rn.png[scale=40]

The two new policies that use information in DNS logs for your AWS cloud accounts to detect anomalies are:

* *Cryptomining domain request activity—* detects when monitored resources attempt to contact a known cryptomining pool using DNS protocol to retrieve the IP address of the cryptominer.

* *DGA domain request activity—* detects when monitored resources attempt to resolve domain names in which domain names look like they are generated by an algorithm.

When you enable DNS log ingestion, and add the DNS anomaly policies to an alert rule, alerts for DNS anomaly policies are triggered.

These new anomaly policies generate alerts when they detect suspicious domains in DNS queries. With the addition of these policies, you also have the ability to specify a *Domain Name* in an anomaly trusted list to suppress alerts. For the domain names that are added to this trusted list, the DNS anomaly policies will not generate alerts.


|tt:[Update] *IAM Access Control for Service Principals*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-54713</draft-comment>+++
|Ensure applications, hosted services, and automated tools securely access your Azure cloud resources with IAM access control for service principals. Assign permissions to the external service or service principal and enforce the appropriate level of access control. Like access control for individual users, service principals can be queried and alerts can be created for application registration and remediation.

Use the userinput:[App Registration] value for userinput:[source.cloud.resource.type] and userinput:[Service Principal] in the userinput:[grantedby.cloud.entity.type] in your IAM queries to query service principals

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*


|*AWS VPC endpoint policy is overly permissive*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-77978</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to check for only VPC Gateway Endpoints. Also, the policy name, description, and recommendation steps have been updated.

*Current Name—* AWS VPC endpoint policy is overly permissive disabled

*Updated Name—* AWS VPC gateway endpoint policy is overly permissive

*Updated Description—* Identifies VPC gateway endpoints that have a VPC endpoint (VPCE) policy that is overly permissive. When the Principal element value is set to '{asterisk}' within the access policy, the VPC gateway endpoint allows full access to any IAM user or service within the VPC using credentials from any AWS accounts. It is highly recommended to have the least privileged VPCE policy to protect the data leakage and unauthorized access.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-describe-vpc-endpoints' AND json.rule = policyDocument.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Action contains * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-describe-vpc-endpoints' AND json.rule = vpcEndpointType equals Gateway and policyDocument.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Action contains * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Impact—* Medium. Existing open alerts related to VPC Endpoint's other than Gateway will be resolved and resolution status will be updated as Policy_Updated.


|*AWS RDS minor upgrades not enabled*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-79541</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to check if the RDS DB instances are in the “available” state.

*Current RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = autoMinorVersionUpgrade is false and engine does not contain docdb and engine does not contain neptune]

*Updated RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = dbinstanceStatus equals available and autoMinorVersionUpgrade is false and engine does not contain docdb and engine does not contain neptune]

*Impact—* Medium. Existing open alerts related to RDS instances which are not in the available state will be resolved and resolution status will be updated as Policy_Updated.


|*Azure AKS cluster pool profile count contains less than 3 nodes*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-78655</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated with new syntax to increase accuracy and the remediation details are updated to reflect the CSP UI changes.

*Updated Description—* Identifies AKS clusters that are configured with node pool profile less than 3 nodes. It is recommended to have at least 3 or more than 3 nodes in a node pool for a more resilient cluster. (Clusters smaller than 3 may experience downtime during upgrades.)

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule =  "properties.agentPoolProfiles[?(@.type == 'AvailabilitySet')].count < 3"
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule = 'properties.powerState.code equal ignore case Running and properties.agentPoolProfiles[?any(type equal ignore case AvailabilitySet and count less than 3)] exists'
----

*Impact—* Low. The alerts generated for stopped resources are resolved with resolution status as Policy_Updated.


|*Azure Front Door does not have the Azure Web application firewall (WAF) enabled*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-79700</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to provide more accuracy in alert results.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor-waf-policy' as Y; filter '$.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id does not exist or ($.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id contains $.Y.name and $.Y.properties.policySettings.enabledState equals Disabled)'; show X;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor-waf-policy' as Y; filter '$.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id does not exist or ($.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id equals $.Y.id and $.Y.properties.policySettings.enabledState equals Disabled)'; show X;
----

*Impact—* Low. The alerts are resolved with resolution status as Policy_Updated.


|*Azure SQL Database with Auditing Retention less than 90 days*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-79880</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL and recommendation steps have been updated to exclude Log Analytics and Event Hubs, as retention periods are not configurable.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '(serverBlobAuditingPolicy does not exist or serverBlobAuditingPolicy is empty or serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.state equals Disabled or serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not exist or (serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.state equals Enabled and serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not equal 0 and serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.retentionDays less than 90))' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-sql-db-list' AND json.rule = 'blobAuditPolicy does not exist or blobAuditPolicy is empty or blobAuditPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not exist or (blobAuditPolicy.properties.state equals Enabled and blobAuditPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not equal 0 and blobAuditPolicy.properties.retentionDays less than 90)' as Y; filter '$.Y.blobAuditPolicy.id contains $.X.sqlServer.name'; show Y;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '(serverBlobAuditingPolicy does not exist or serverBlobAuditingPolicy is empty or serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.state equals Disabled or serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not exist or (serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.storageEndpoint is not empty and serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.state equals Enabled and serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not equal 0 and serverBlobAuditingPolicy.properties.retentionDays less than 90))' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-sql-db-list' AND json.rule = '(blobAuditPolicy does not exist or blobAuditPolicy is empty or blobAuditPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not exist or (blobAuditPolicy.properties.storageEndpoint is not empty and blobAuditPolicy.properties.state equals Enabled and blobAuditPolicy.properties.retentionDays does not equal 0 and blobAuditPolicy.properties.retentionDays less than 90))' as Y; filter '$.Y.blobAuditPolicy.id contains $.X.sqlServer.name'; show Y;
----

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts for SQL databases configured with Log Analytics and Event hubs auditing will be resolved as Policy_Updated.


|*GCP PostgreSQL instance database flag log_statement is not set appropriately*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-72950</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been enhanced to resolve false alerts by changing the contain operator to equals. Due to this, collision with similar flag names such as userinput:[log_statement_stats] will be avoided.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-sql-instances-list' AND json.rule = "state equals RUNNABLE and databaseVersion contains POSTGRES and (settings.databaseFlags[*].name does not contain log_statement or settings.databaseFlags[?any(name contains log_statement and value contains all or value contains none )] exists)"
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-sql-instances-list' AND json.rule = state equals RUNNABLE and databaseVersion contains POSTGRES and ( settings.databaseFlags[?any( name equals "log_statement" )] does not exist or settings.databaseFlags[?any( name equals "log_statement" and value equals "all" or value equals "none" )] exists)
----

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts due to collision with similar flag names will be resolved as Policy_Updated.


|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have binary authorization disabled*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-79890</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to match CSP data. The datapoint userinput:[binaryAuthorization.enabled] is deprecated and replaced by userinput:[binaryAuthorization.evaluationMode] and the remediation CLI is removed since no single CLI command is available to update both Zonal and Regional GKE clusters.

*Current RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = 'binaryAuthorization does not exist or binaryAuthorization.enabled is false']

*Updated RQL—*

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = binaryAuthorization.evaluationMode does not exist or binaryAuthorization.evaluationMode equal ignore case EVALUATION_MODE_UNSPECIFIED or binaryAuthorization.evaluationMode equal ignore case DISABLED]

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated new alerts will be generated for existing resources. Also, no remediation support will be available for this policy.

=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

+++<draft-comment>RLP-75166</draft-comment>+++
|*Global Region Support for Google Compute Engine*

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support for screen:[gcloud-compute-instance-template API]. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted once, and then regenerated on the management console.
Existing alerts corresponding to these resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against the policy
violations.

*Impact—* You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for screen:[gcloud-compute-instance-template] start ingesting data again.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-74909</draft-comment>+++
|*Region Support for Google Cloud Load Balancing APIs*

Prisma Cloud can now store regional resources as well as global resources for screen:[gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies] and screen:[gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies] APIs. Due to this, new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice an increased count in the number of alerts for gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies and gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies APIs.


|*Alerts for Audit Events*

// RLP-80585. We will need to keep a watch on the GA date. After moving this blurb to GA i.e features introduced section, add the following statement under the title inside the <tt> tag- This change was first introduced in the look ahead that was published with the 22.10.2 release.
|To make your experience with audit event alerts consistent with configuration alerts for custom policies, the policy evaluation for audit events is updated to use the alert rule configuration. The targets for the cloud accounts and cloud regions for which you want to trigger alerts are now only inherited from the alert rule.

Earlier, when you run an audit event query on the *Investigate* page, and save the query as a saved search and then use this saved search query as match criteria in a policy, the matched issues that trigger alerts used inputs from both the alert rule configuration and saved search.

As an example, if you had created a saved search that includes the RQL for cloud.account, cloud.accountgroup, or cloud.region, such as userinput:[event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Canada' AND operation IN ('DeleteAccessKey')] the cloud.account, and cloud.region attributes will now be ignored for custom and existing policies and their associated alerts.

Only, the target cloud accounts and cloud regions that you specify in the alert rule configuration will be used to scope when alerts are generated for the custom Audit Event policy.

*Impact—* The change in how the targets for generating alerts scoped may result in a larger number of alerts than before. This change will be rolled out gradually over multiple phases.

This change was first introduced in the look ahead that was published with the 22.10.2 release.
