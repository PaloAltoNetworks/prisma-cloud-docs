|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Prisma Cloud Data Security—Scan Resources By True File Type*
|When scanning files for data security, files are now identified based on the *True File Type* as determined by file metadata, regardless of the file extension for all https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/supported-file-extensions#supported-file-extensions[supported] file types.

image::true-file-type-2.png[scale=40]

Alerts are generated whenever a file that is scanned based on the True File Type, violates a Prisma Cloud Data Security policy.

Previously, the *Data Security Settings* page, displayed the aggregate file size for all files supported for Sensitive Data Scan and Malware Scan based on their file extensions under their respective columns. With True File Type, the page now displays the aggregate file size for all eligible files based on their True File Type, regardless of their file extensions. Prisma Cloud Data Security still only supports files up to 20MB.

+++<draft-comment>Ashwini, I removed the statement “Previously, Prisma Cloud would scan files based on their extension, for example .exe, .pdf. “</draft-comment>+++

image::true-file-type-3.png[scale=40]

While adding a data policy, if you select the *File Extension* checkbox, Prisma Cloud Data Security will only scan files based on True File Type, regardless of their file extensions.

|*Auto Completion Updates for Amazon VPC API RQL Query*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-60993. Added this blurb in 22.8.2</draft-comment>+++
|On the *Investigate* page, the RQL config query for userinput:[aws-describe-vpc-endpoints] API displays the appropriate fields under `policyDocument.Statement[]` during auto-completion. For example, if you want to construct the following RQL query `config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-describe-vpc-endpoints' AND json.rule = serviceName ends with ".s3" and policyDocument.Statement[].Condition.StringEquals.aws:PrincipalOrgID[] is not member of (o-0hc9vcq8o1, o-slnhz39n91)`, you can see `policyDocument.Statement[].Condition.StringEquals.aws:PrincipalOrgID[]`options appear in the list automatically.


|tt:[Change in Existing Behavior] *Prisma Cloud Data Security—Object Scan for Glacier Deep Archive and Glacier Flexible Retrieval Storage Classes*
|The feature which shows the objects that belong to *Glacier Deep Archive* and *Glacier Flexible Retrieval* (formerly Glacier) as *Un-supported storage class* in Inventory is disabled and objects that belong to these two storage classes will display as *Not Supported*.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*Instance affected by OMIGOD vulnerability is exposed to network traffic from the internet*

Identifies VM instances installed with Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) version vulnerable for remote code execution (CVE-2021-38647) vulnerability, also known as OMIGOD Vulnerability and exposed to network traffic from the Internet. It is recommended to upgrade OMI to the latest version and limit exposure to the Internet.

----
network from vpc.flow_record where bytes > 0 AND source.resource IN ( resource where finding.type IN ( 'Host Vulnerability' ) AND finding.source IN ( 'Prisma Cloud' ) AND finding.name IN ('CVE-2021-38647')) AND destination.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs')
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-59232</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Service bus namespace configured with overly permissive network access*

Identifies Azure Service bus namespaces (premium tier) configured with overly permissive network access. By default, Service bus namespaces are accessible from the Internet as long as the request comes with valid authentication and authorization. With an IP firewall, you can further restrict it to only a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges. With virtual networks, the network traffic path is secured on both ends. It is recommended to configure the Service bus namespace with an IP firewall or by virtual network so that the Service bus namespace is accessible only to restricted entities.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-service-bus-namespace' AND json.rule = sku.tier equals "Premium" and properties.status equals "Active" and networkRuleSets[*].properties.defaultAction equals "Allow" and networkRuleSets[*].properties.publicNetworkAccess equals Enabled
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-50651</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP VPC network not configured with DNS policy with logging enabled*

Identifies GCP VPC network that is not configured with logging enabled DNS policy. Monitoring of Cloud DNS logs provides visibility to DNS names requested by the clients within the VPC. These logs can be monitored for anomalous domain names and evaluated against threat intelligence. It is recommended to enable DNS logging for all the VPC networks.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-networks-list' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-dns-policy' as Y; filter 'not($.Y.networks[*].networkUrl contains $.X.name and $.Y.enableLogging is true)'; show X;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-39932</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—Metadata*
|*AWS API gateway request parameter is not validated*

*Changes—* The policy description has been improvised to be more precise.

*Current Description—* This policy identifies the AWS API gateways for with the request parameters are not validated. It is recommended to validate the request parameters in the URI, query string, and headers of an incoming request to focus on the validation efforts specific to your application.

*Updated Description—* This policy identifies the AWS API gateways for which the request parameters are not validated. When the validation fails, API Gateway fails the request, returns a 400 error response to the caller, and publishes the validation results in CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended to perform basic validation of an API request before proceeding with the integration request to block unvalidated calls to the backend.

*Impact—* No impact on policy behavior or existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-62210</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP Kubernetes engine clusters have client certificate disabled*

*Changes—* The cloud type for this policy was incorrect after converting the policy from run-build to build. It is now updated to GCP, which is the correct cloud type.

*Impact—* No impact on policy behavior or existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-64121</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Master authorized networks disabled*

*Changes—* Auto-remediation CLI has been added to the policy. The RQL has been updated to check clusters with status 'RUNNING'. The recommendation steps have also been updated to match the latest UI changes.

Permission required for CLI execution:

screen:[container.clusters.update]

*Current RQL—* 

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = 'masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.[*] is empty or masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled equals false'
----


*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and (masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.[*] is empty or masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled equals "false")
----


*Impact—* If auto-remediation is enabled for the policy, the alerts will be resolved as ‘REMEDIATED’ or ‘Resource_Updated’. Previously generated alerts with cluster state other than ‘RUNNING’ will be resolved automatically.

|*GCP Firewall rule exposes GKE clusters by allowing all traffic on read-only port (10255)*

Identifies GCP Firewall rule that allows all traffic on read-only port (10255), which exposes GKE clusters. In GKE, Kubelet exposes a read-only port 10255 which shows the configurations of all pods on the cluster at the /pods API endpoint. GKE itself does not expose this port to the Internet because the default project firewall configuration blocks external access. However, it is possible to inadvertently expose this port publicly on GKE clusters by creating a Google Compute Engine VPC firewall for GKE nodes that allows traffic from all source ranges on all the ports. This configuration publicly exposes all pod configurations, which might contain sensitive information.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = disabled is false and direction equals INGRESS and (sourceRanges[*] equals ::0 or sourceRanges[*] equals 0.0.0.0 or sourceRanges[*] equals 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] equals ::/0 or sourceRanges[*] equals ::) and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(10255,10255) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp or IPProtocol contains "all")))] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING as Y; filter '$.X.network contains $.Y.networkConfig.network' ; show X;

|*16 New Anomaly Policies that Map to MITRE ATT&CK v10.0*
|There are 16 new UEBA Anomaly policies to detect user activity from the TOR anonymity network. Each policy corresponds to one of the different service groups available in AWS, Azure, and GCP—for example—analytics, containers, compute, security, storage, and web. All the policies are classified as high severity and identify defense evasion and impact attack tactics listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The policies are disabled by default, but customers can manually enable them according to their security needs and the cloud services used in their environments. Here’s the list of UEBA policies:

* *Suspicious activity in Security services*
* *Suspicious activity in Networking services*
* *Suspicious activity in Analytics services*
* *Suspicious activity in Monitoring / Management services*
* *Suspicious activity in Database services*
* *Suspicious activity in Compute services*
* *Suspicious activity in Storage services*
* *Suspicious activity in Application Integration services*
* *Suspicious activity in Containers services*
* *Suspicious activity in AI / ML services*
* *Suspicious activity in Migration services*
* *Suspicious activity in Dev Tools services*
* *Suspicious activity in Web services*
* *Suspicious activity in IoT services*
* *Suspicious activity in Media services*
* *Suspicious login activity*
