|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*Policy Updates*
|*Improved Anomalous Compute Provisioning Policy* For improving the detection capability and reducing the false negative rate of the *Anomalous Compute Provisioning* policy, it has been moved from subject-based modeling to cloud account-based modeling for volumetric detection. The activity from all subjects, for example, user accounts belonging to the same account are now part of the model. Those with no or low activity during the training period qualify for anomaly detection, provided there are sufficient events at the account level.

|*Host Findings Count in Network Anomaly Alerts*
|The response object of the following API request no longer includes the host findings count:

*  userinput:[GET /alert/{id}] 

Specifically:

* For a network anomaly alert where the source host is the reported vulnerability, the response object no longer includes attribute varname:[metadata.anomalyDetail.srcHost.hostFindingCount].

* For a network anomaly alert where the target host is the reported vulnerability:** The response object no longer includes attribute varname:[targetHostFinding].

** Response object attribute varname:[metadata.anomalyDetail.features[].targetHost.details[].hostFindingCount] is null.

You can still access host findings data through:

*  userinput:[GET /resource/external_finding]

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Network Exposure of Cloud Resources*
|https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-network-security.html[Prisma Cloud Network Security] helps enhance your network security posture within public cloud environments. Its Network Analyzer engine automatically calculates net effective reachability of your cloud resources such as EC2, RDS, and Redshift ENIs. In addition, it helps detect unrestricted network access from the Internet or external network domains.

Using the RQL query screen:[config from network where]on the *Investigate* page, you can understand the reachability of your cloud assets and also validate if someone exploited the overly permissive network access.

[NOTE]
====
Network exposure queries are currently supported only on AWS.

Network exposure queries are currently not available in Government and China regions.

|tt:[^GA^]  *Adoption Advisor*
|Tracking and measuring your adoption of new features and existing capabilities on Prisma Cloud just got easier!

The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/adoption-advisor[Adoption Advisor] is generally available to all and gives visibility into your adoption journey, identifies your unexplored features, helps you make the most of your investment, and provides guidance on where to take action.

|*ServiceNow Test Incident Improvement*
|The Prisma Cloud integration with https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-servicenow[ServiceNow] has been improved to generate only one test incident for the *Open*, *Dismissed*, or *Resolved* alert notification states configured within a notification template.

With this change, when you test a new integration, only a single incident is sent to your ServiceNow instance as it transitions through the different alert states.

image::servicenow-incident-count.png[scale=25]


[NOTE]
====
This change is only applicable to the Incident and Security types in ServiceNow.

|tt:[Change in Existing Behavior]  *VM Count on Asset Inventory*
|The *Asset Inventory* page double counts the number of Azure VMs in your deployment.

To address this issue, the 22.2.1 release includes a fix that will reduce the Azure VM count in half (drop of around 50%) in the Asset Inventory.

With this change, there is no impact on RQL or licensing.

==== New Policies and Policy Updates
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*Azure MySQL Database Server using insecure TLS version*

Identifies Azure MySQL Database Servers which are using the insecure TLS version. As a best practice, use the newer TLS version as the minimum TLS version.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-mysql-server' AND json.rule = properties.sslEnforcement equals Enabled and properties.minimalTlsVersion does not equal TLS1_2]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-39338</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Storage Account using insecure TLS version*

Identifies Azure Storage Accounts which are using the insecure TLS version. As a best practice, use the newer TLS version as the minimum TLS version for Azure Storage Accounts.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.supportsHttpsTrafficOnly is true and properties.minimumTlsVersion does not equal TLS1_2]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-39115</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP VM instance OS login overrides Project metadata OS login configuration*

Identifies GCP VM instances where the OS Login configuration is overriding the project OS Login configuration. Enabling OS Login ensures that the SSH keys used to connect to instances are mapped with IAM users. Revoking access to an IAM user will revoke all the SSH keys associated with that userâ€”it facilitates centralized and automated SSH key pair management which is useful in handling cases like a response to compromised SSH key pairs.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-project-info' AND json.rule = commonInstanceMetadata.items[?any(key contains "enable-oslogin" and (value contains "Yes" or value contains "Y" or value contains "True" or value contains "true" or value contains "TRUE" or value contains "1"))] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = (metadata.items[?any(key exists and key contains "enable-oslogin" and (value contains "False" or value contains "N" or value contains "No" or value contains "false" or value contains "FALSE" or value contains "0"))] exists and name does not start with "gke-" and status equals RUNNING) as Y;filter'$.Y.zone contains $.X.name';show Y;

|*New Anomaly Policies*
|There are 16 new UEBA anomaly policies to detect user activity from the TOR anonymity network. TOR is often used by hackers to hide their identity so that their suspicious operations like creating copies of VM images wonâ€™t be traced back to them. Each policy corresponds to one of the different service groups available in AWS, Azure, and GCPâ€”for exampleâ€”analytics, containers, compute, security, storage, and web. All the policies are classified as high severity and identify defense evasion and impact attack tactics listed in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The policies are disabled by default, but customers can manually enable them according to their security needs and the cloud services used in their environments. Hereâ€™s the list of UEBA policies:

* *Suspicious activities in Security services*
* *Suspicious activities in Application Integration services*
* *Suspicious activities in Networking services*
* *Suspicious activities in Analytics services*
* *Suspicious activities in Monitoring / Management services*
* *Suspicious activities in Database services*
* *Suspicious activities in Compute services*
* *Suspicious activities in Storage services*
* *Suspicious activities in AI / ML services*
* *Suspicious activities in Containers services*
* *Suspicious activities in Migration services*
* *Suspicious activities in IoT services*
* *Suspicious activities in Dev Tools services*
* *Suspicious activities in Media services*
* *Suspicious login activity*
* *Suspicious activities in Web services*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-47243</draft-comment>+++


|*Reduction of Alerts for Anomaly Policies*
|The following anomaly policies have a reduction from high to medium:

* *Account hijacking attempts*
* *Excessive login failures*
* *Port scan activity (Internal)*
* *Port sweep activity (Internal)*
* *Spambot activity*
* *Unusual protocol activity (External)*
* *Unusual protocol activity (Internal)*
* *Unusual server port activity (External)*
* *Unusual server port activity (Internal)*
* *Unusual user activity*

The following anomaly policies have a reduction from high to low:

* *Port scan activity (External)*
* *Port sweep activity (External)*

|*New CNS Policies*
|*AWS Redshift managed ENI reachable from any untrust internet source* Identifies Network interfaces attached to the Redshift cluster that are exposed to inbound traffic from any untrusted Internet source. Redshift clusters exposed to the Internet are prone to external security threats. As a best practice, restrict network interfaces that are attached to the Redshift cluster to known hosts or services only.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-57378</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS RDS managed ENI reachable from any untrust internet source* Identifies Network interfaces attached to RDS instances that are exposed to inbound traffic from any untrusted Internet source. RDS instances exposed to the Internet are prone to external security threats. As a best practice, restrict network interfaces that are attached to the RDS instance to known hosts or services only.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-57377</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS EC2 instance allows outbound unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to the internet* Identifies EC2 instances that allow unrestricted outbound traffic to the Internet. As a best practice, restrict outbound traffic and limit the access to known hosts or services.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-57376</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS EC2 instance that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port* Identifies AWS EC2 instances that are reachable from the Internet with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port. EC2 instances with unrestricted access to the Internet enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-56917</draft-comment>+++


|*Delete AWS Security Group Related Policies*
|*Changesâ€“* The following userinput:[config] policies are deleted because Cloud Network Analyzer provides you alerts for resources which are truly exposed to the Internet. You can create custom policies to alert on specific ports:
