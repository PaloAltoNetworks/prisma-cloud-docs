|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Customized Views for Alert Prioritization*
|https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/saved-views[Saved views] on Prisma Cloud simplifies the challenge of prioritizing alerts. With Saved Views, alerts are organized into appropriate threat vector categories so that your teams can focus on what matters the most. The 8 default views are Overview, Incidents, Exposure, Vulnerabilities, Misconfigurations, CIEM, Malware, and Data, and you can choose to enable or disable these.

Each view includes preset filters that display the most relevant alerts for the category. As an example, the Exposure saved view provides a look at all of the internet exposure alerts. In addition, you can filter on the most important alert criteria to create your own Saved Views, and choose the visualizations and the default sort order of the tabular data.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*Policy Updates-RQL*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-71949</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS EKS cluster security group overly permissive to all traffic*

*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to check for default cluster Security Groups along with custom attached Security Groups attached to the EKS cluster.

*Current RQL—* 

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-security-groups' AND json.rule = isShared is false and (ipPermissions[*].ipv4Ranges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or ipPermissions[*].ipv6Ranges[*] contains ::/0) as Y; filter '$.X.resourcesVpcConfig.securityGroupIds contains $.Y.groupId'; show Y;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-eks-describe-cluster' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-security-groups' AND json.rule = isShared is false and (ipPermissions[*].ipv4Ranges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or ipPermissions[*].ipv6Ranges[*] contains ::/0) as Y; filter '$.X.resourcesVpcConfig.securityGroupIds contains $.Y.groupId or $.X.resourcesVpcConfig.clusterSecurityGroupId contains $.Y.groupId'; show Y;
----

*Impact—* Low. New alerts will be triggered for AWS EKS cluster which are having default cluster security group overly permissive to all traffic.


|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-74594</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS Lambda function managed ENI reachable from untrust internet source*

*Changes—* The policy subtype has been updated from *Network Event* to *Network Config*.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.


|*Policy Deletion*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-71653</draft-comment>+++
|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have pod security policy disabled*

Deleted this policy and Out of the Box (OOB) compliance mappings since pod security status information is no longer available.

*Impact—* Low. Previously generated alerts are resolved as Policy_Deleted.

=== New Policies and Policy Updates

See the xref:../look-ahead-planned-updates-prisma-cloud.adoc#ida01a4ab4-6a2c-429d-95be-86d8ac88a7b4[look ahead updates] for planned features and policy updates for 22.8.2

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|Policy Updates
|Description


|*New Policy*
|*AWS Lambda function URL AuthType set to NONE*

Identifies AWS Lambda which has function URL AuthType set to NONE. AuthType determines how Lambda authenticates or authorizes requests to your function URL. When AuthType is set to NONE, Lambda doesn't perform any authentication before invoking your function. It is highly recommended to set AuthType to AWS_IAM for Lambda function URL to authenticate via AWS IAM.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-lambda-list-functions' AND json.rule = authType equal ignore case NONE]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-72019</draft-comment>+++


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-70897</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS DocumentDB cluster deletion protection is disabled*

Identifies AWS DocumentDB clusters for which deletion protection is disabled. Enabling deletion protection for DocumentDB clusters prevents irreversible data loss resulting from accidental or malicious operations.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-docdb-db-cluster' AND json.rule = Status contains available and DeletionProtection is false]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-70896</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS Neptune Cluster not configured with IAM authentication*

Identifies AWS Neptune clusters that are not configured with IAM authentication. If you enable IAM authentication, you don't need to store user credentials in the database because authentication is managed externally using IAM. IAM database authentication ensures the network traffic to and from database clusters is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), provides central access management to your database resources, and enforces the use of profile credentials instead of a password for greater security.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-neptune-db-cluster' AND json.rule = Status contains available and IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled is false]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-70895</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS Neptune cluster deletion protection is disabled*

Identifies AWS Neptune clusters for which deletion protection is disabled. Enabling deletion protection for Neptune clusters prevents irreversible data loss resulting from accidental or malicious operations.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-neptune-db-cluster' AND json.rule = Status contains available and DeletionProtection is false]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-38844</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS Web Application Firewall v2 (AWS WAFv2) logging is disabled*

Identifies Web Application Firewall v2s (AWS WAFv2) for which logging is disabled. Enabling WAFv2 logging logs all web requests inspected by the service which can be used for debugging and additional forensics. The logs will help to understand why certain rules are triggered and why certain web requests are blocked. You can also integrate the logs with any SIEM and log analysis tools for further analysis. It is recommended to enable logging on your Web Application Firewall v2s (WAFv2).

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-waf-v2-web-acl-resource' AND json.rule = '(resources.applicationLoadBalancer[*] exists or resources.apiGateway[*] exists or resources.other[*] exists) and loggingConfiguration.resourceArn does not exist'
----


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-38843</draft-comment>+++
|*AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) Classic logging is disabled*

Identifies Classic Web Application Firewalls (AWS WAFs) for which logging is disabled. Enabling WAF logging, logs all web requests inspected by the service which can be used for debugging and additional forensics. The logs will help to understand why certain rules are triggered and why certain web requests are blocked. You can also integrate the logs with any SIEM and log analysis tools for further analysis. It is recommended to enable logging on your Classic Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-waf-classic-web-acl-resource' AND json.rule = '(resources.applicationLoadBalancer[*] exists or resources.apiGateway[*] exists or resources.other[*] exists) and loggingConfiguration.resourceArn does not exist'
----


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-61023</draft-comment>+++
|*Azure Service bus namespace not configured with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication*

Identifies Service bus namespaces that are not configured with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and are enabled with local authentication. Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over shared access signatures (SAS). With Azure AD, there is no need to store the tokens in your code and risk potential security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to configure the Service bus namespaces with Azure AD authentication so that all actions are strongly authenticated.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-service-bus-namespace' AND json.rule = properties.status equals "Active" and (properties.disableLocalAuth does not exist or properties.disableLocalAuth is false)]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-70842</draft-comment>+++
|*Azure Virtual Machine vTPM feature is disabled*

Identifies Virtual Machines that have Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) feature disabled. Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) provide enhanced security to the guest operating system. It is recommended to enable virtual TPM device on supported virtual machines to facilitate measured Boot and other OS security features that require a TPM.

[NOTE]
====
This assessment only applies to trusted launch enabled virtual machines. You can't enable trusted launch on existing virtual machines that were initially created without it.
====

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-vm-list' AND json.rule = powerState equal ignore case "PowerState/running" and ['properties.securityProfile'].['securityType'] equal ignore case "TrustedLaunch" and ['properties.securityProfile'].['uefiSettings'].['vTpmEnabled'] is false
----


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-70821</draft-comment>+++
|*Azure Virtual Machine (Windows) secure boot feature is disabled*

Identifies Virtual Machines (Windows) that have the secure boot feature disabled. Enabling Secure Boot on supported Windows virtual machines provides mitigation against malicious and unauthorized changes to the boot chain. The secure boot helps protect your VMs against boot kits, rootkits, and kernel-level malware. So it is recommended to enable Secure boot for Azure Windows virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
This assessment only applies to trusted launch-enabled Windows virtual machines. You can't enable trusted launch on existing virtual machines that were initially created without it.
====

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-vm-list' AND json.rule = powerState equal ignore case "PowerState/running" and ['properties.storageProfile'].['osDisk'].['osType'] contains "Windows" and ['properties.securityProfile'].['securityType'] equal ignore case "TrustedLaunch" and ['properties.securityProfile'].['uefiSettings'].['secureBootEnabled'] is false
----


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-69481</draft-comment>+++
|*Azure Batch account is not configured with managed identity*

Identifies Batch accounts that are not configured with managed identity. Managed identity can be used to authenticate any service that supports Azure AD authentication without having credentials in your code. Storing credentials in a code increases the threat surface in case of exploitation, and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials. So as a security best practice, it is recommended to have the managed identity to your Batch account.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-batch-account' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and identity does not exist or identity.type equal ignore case "None"]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-67416</draft-comment>+++
|*OCI Kubernetes Engine Cluster endpoint is not configured with Network Security Groups*

Identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters endpoint that are not configured with Network Security Groups. Network security groups give fine-grained control of resources and help in restricting network access to your cluster node pools. It is recommended to restrict access to the Cluster node pools by configuring network security groups.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'oci' AND api.name = 'oci-containers-artifacts-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule = lifecycleState equal ignore case ACTIVE and endpointConfig exists and (endpointConfig.nsgIds does not exist or endpointConfig.nsgIds equal ignore case "null" or endpointConfig.nsgIds is empty)]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-67244</draft-comment>+++
|*OCI Kubernetes Engine Cluster boot volume is not configured with in-transit data encryption*

Identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters that are not configured with in-transit data encryption. Configuring In-transit encryption on clusters boot volumes, encrypts data in transit between the instance, the boot volume, and the block volumes. All the data moving between the instance and the block volume is transferred over an internal and highly secure network. It is recommended that Clusters boot volumes should be configured with in-transit data encryption to minimize risk for sensitive data being leaked.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'oci' AND api.name = 'oci-containers-artifacts-kubernetes-cluster-nodepool' AND json.rule = lifecycleState equal ignore case ACTIVE and (nodeConfigDetails.isPvEncryptionInTransitEnabled equal ignore case "null" or nodeConfigDetails.isPvEncryptionInTransitEnabled does not exist)]


|
+++<draft-comment>RLP-67241</draft-comment>+++
|*OCI Kubernetes Engine Cluster pod security policy not enforced*

Identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters that are not enforced with pod security policy. The Pod Security Policy defines a set of conditions that pods must meet to be accepted by the cluster; when a request to create or update a pod does not meet the conditions in the pod security policy, that request is rejected and an error is returned.

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'oci' AND api.name = 'oci-containers-artifacts-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule = lifecycleState equal ignore case ACTIVE and options.admissionControllerOptions.isPodSecurityPolicyEnabled is false]

|The New York DFS Cybersecurity Regulations (23 NYCRR 500) are a new set of regulations by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) that imposes new cybersecurity requirements on all covered financial institutions.

These regulations are designed to ensure your organization can effectively protect your customers' confidential information from cyberattacks. These include conducting regular security risk assessments, keeping audit trails of asset use, providing defensive infrastructures, maintaining policies and procedures for cyber security, and creating an incident response plan.

Violation of these regulations can result in fines of up to US$250,000 or one percent of total bank assets.
