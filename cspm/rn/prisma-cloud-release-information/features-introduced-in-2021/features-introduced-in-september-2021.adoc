|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policy*
|*AWS ElastiCache Redis with in-transit encryption disabled (Non-replication group)*

Identifies ElastiCache Redis that are in non-replication groups or individual ElastiCache Redis and have in-transit encryption disabled.

Enabling data encryption in-transit helps prevent unauthorized users from reading sensitive data between your Redis and their associated cache storage systems.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elasticache-cache-clusters' AND json.rule = transitEncryptionEnabled is false and replicationGroupId does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-43185</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*AWS IAM policy allows assume role permission across all services*

*Update—* The RQL has been updated to exclude AWS-managed policies.

*Updated RQL—* The updated RQL is:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = isAttached is true and document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action contains sts:AssumeRole and Resource anyStartWith * and Condition does not exist)] exists and policyArn does not contain iam::aws
----

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-44477</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS CloudTrail is not enabled in all regions*

*Update—* The RQL has been updated based on the changes in the CIS guideline. The policy name, description, and recommendation have also been updated.

*Updated Policy Name—* *AWS CloudTrail is not enabled with multi trail and not capturing all management events*

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-describe-trails' AND json.rule = 'isMultiRegionTrail is true and includeGlobalServiceEvents is true' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-get-trail-status' AND json.rule = 'status.isLogging equals true' as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-get-event-selectors' AND json.rule = 'eventSelectors[*].readWriteType contains All' as Z; filter '($.X.trailARN equals $.Z.trailARN) and ($.X.name equals $.Y.trail)'; show X; count(X) less than 1
----

*Impact—* Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated and new alerts will get generated based on the configuration.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-40959</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS ECR repository is exposed to public*

*Update—* The policy name, description, RQL, and recommendation has been changed to match policy as overly permissive instead of exposed to public.

*Updated Policy Name—* *AWS ECR repository policy is overly permissive*

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ecr-get-repository-policy' AND json.rule = policy.Statement[?any((Principal equals * or Principal.AWS contains *) and Effect equals Allow and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-43782</draft-comment>+++

|
|*AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster with in-transit encryption disabled*

*Update—* The policy name and description have been updated to notify that policy is for the replication group.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-42712</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*

*Updates—* The RQL has been updated to check if the subnet is used by any private endpoint, and the policy description has been updated accordingly.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name is not member of ("GatewaySubnet", "AzureFirewallSubnet") and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

[#idf5d7c997-d9d5-431e-90f3-0dad2fd6e2ba]
=== New Policies and Policy Updates

Prisma Cloud includes three new *Azure Cosmos DB* policies to resolve a critical vulnerability recently reported in Azure Cosmos DB. These were added without an advance notice due to their critical nature.

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*Azure Cosmos DB key based authentication is enabled* Identifies Cosmos DBs that are enabled with key-based authentication. Disabling key-based metadata write access on Azure Cosmos DB prevents any changes to resources from a client connecting using the account keys.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cosmos-db' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45826</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Cosmos DB Virtual network is not configured* Checks for Azure Cosmos DBs that are not configured with a virtual network.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cosmos-db' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.virtualNetworkRules[*] does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45825</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Cosmos DB Private Endpoint Connection is not configured* Identifies Cosmos databases (DBs) that are not configured with a private endpoint connection. You can configure the Azure Cosmos DB private endpoints using Azure Private Link, which allows you to access an Azure Cosmos account from within the virtual network or from any peered virtual network.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cosmos-db' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45467</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) is not using the latest predefined security policy* The RQL is updated to escape RQL validation check since it was using the reserved word *network*.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = 'type equals network and listeners[?any(protocol equals TLS and sslPolicy exists and (sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2020-10 and sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06))] exists'
----

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45350</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—Metadata*
|*AWS RDS database instance is publicly accessible*A typo in the description was fixed.

The policy description is updated as follows:

This policy identifies RDS database instances which are publicly accessible. DB instances should not be publicly accessible to protect the integrity of data. Public accessibility of DB instances can be modified by turning on or off the Public accessibility parameter.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

|DESCRIPTION


|*Updated Response Object for CSPM Policy Endpoints that List Policies*
|The response objects for the endpoints that list policies include the property varname:[policyClass]. A new value, varname:[exposure], replaces varname:[misconfiguration] as one of the valid values for this property. The affected endpoints are:

* userinput:[GET /policy] 
* userinput:[GET /v2/policy] 


|tt:[Update] *Changes to cloudType for Uniformity Across all Third-Party Integrations*
|If you are using Alerts 2.0, the field in the alert notifications sent to third-party integrations are displayed in lowercase letters as follows:

----
cloudType
----

* aws instead of AWS
* azure instead of Azure
* gcp instead of Google Cloud Platform
* alibaba_cloud instead of Alibaba Cloud
* oci instead of OCI

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45985</draft-comment>+++
