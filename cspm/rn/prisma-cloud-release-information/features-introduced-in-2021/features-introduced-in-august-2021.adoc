|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Exclusion of Apps-Script Projects on GCP*
|If you have onboarded your GCP Organization on Prisma Cloud, note that Prisma Cloud will automatically exclude all Apps-Script Projects that are published with add-ons for Google Workspace application such as Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms.

You do not need to take any action as the Prisma Cloud ingestion handles the exclusion of these automatically created non-billable projects for you.

* Any projects with the name 'sys-[26 numbers]' will not be onboarded to Prisma Cloud.

* For each project, if already onboarded, an audit log is generated to state Excluding the auto-created GCP projects from ingestion. These projects are identified by name format 'sys-[26 numbers]', and the project will be deleted on Prisma Cloud.

* These apps-script projects will not be available for you to choose for monitoring when you onboard or edit a GCP account on menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts].

+++<draft-comment>RLP-44551, Matangi’s RN blurb</draft-comment>+++


|*Fresh Look for Integrations*
|You can configure integrations on Prisma Cloud using the new modal wizard, which provides a better user experience.

When you add an external integration from menu:Settings[Integrations > Add Integration] and select, for example https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-qualys.html[Qualys], the new modal wizard displays and you can configure the Qualys integration.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34901, description needs polishing</draft-comment>+++


|*New Operators for JSON Rule Expressions*
|JSON rule expressions now support the following case-insensitive equality operators to help you match results for strings:

* *equal ignore case*

* *does not equal ignore case*

The following example uses the *equal ignore case* operator

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.account = 'AWS_Evident_5390' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-security-groups' AND json.rule = groupName equal ignore case Prod-auto-SG1
----


In this example, the results displayed will match group names that match the specified string—Prod-auto-SG1— and include all instances of uppercase and lowercase letters in the group name string.


|*Prisma Cloud Log-In Page*
|The Prisma Cloud log-in page is updated. The URL is varname:[\https://<your_region>.prismacloud.io/auth/signin].

If your organization has multiple Prisma Cloud tenants, you can select the Tenant from a drop-down list and sign in to the administrative console.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS ECS cluster with container insights feature disabled* Identifies ECS clusters that are disabled with the Container Insights feature. Container Insights collects metrics at the cluster, task, and service levels. As a best practice, enable Container Insights to collect the data available through these logs for the reported ECS cluster.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ecs-cluster' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and settings[?any(name equals containerInsights and value equals disabled)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35953</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS RDS cluster not configured with IAM authentication* Identifies RDS clusters that are not configured with IAM authentication. IAM database authentication ensures that the network traffic to and from database clusters are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). As a best practice, manage access to your database resources and profile credentials centrally instead of using a password.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-rds-db-cluster' AND json.rule = status contains available and (engine contains postgres or engine contains mysql) and iamdatabaseAuthenticationEnabled is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35767</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS RDS instance not configured with IAM authentication* Identifies RDS instances that are not configured with IAM authentication. IAM database authentication ensures that the network traffic to and from database instances are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). As a best practice, manage access to your database resources and profile credentials centrally instead of using a password as this provides greater security.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = dbinstanceStatus contains available and dbclusterIdentifier does not exist and (engine contains postgres or engine contains mysql) and engineVersion is not member of (8.0.11, 8.0.13, 8.0.15, 9.6.1, 9.6.2, 9.6.3, 9.6.5, 9.6.6, 9.6.8, 9.6.9, 9.6.10, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5) and iamdatabaseAuthenticationEnabled is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35080</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS RDS instance delete protection is disabled* Identifies RDS instances that have delete protection disabled. Enabling delete protection prevents irreversible data loss from accidental or malicious operations.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = dbinstanceStatus contains available and dbclusterIdentifier does not exist and deletionProtection is false
----

----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35078</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*Azure VM data disk is encrypted with the default encryption key instead of ADE/CMK* The policy RQL has been updated to resolve false positive and addition of a check for varname:[EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformAndCustomerKeys] when disk is double encrypted with Platform-Managed and Customer-Managed keys.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-disk-list' AND json.rule = 'osType does not exist and managedBy exists and (encryptionSettings does not exist or encryptionSettings.enabled is false) and encryption.type is not member of ("EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey", "EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformAndCustomerKeys")'
----


*Impact—* Previously generated alerts for disk with double encryption will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-42359</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure disk is unattached and is encrypted with the default encryption key instead of ADE/CMK* The policy RQL has been updated to resolve false positive and addition of a check for varname:[EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformAndCustomerKeys] when disk is double encrypted with Platform-Managed and Customer-Managed keys.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-disk-list' AND json.rule = '(managedBy does not exist or managedBy is empty) and (encryptionSettings does not exist or encryptionSettings.enabled is false) and encryption.type is not member of ("EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey", "EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformAndCustomerKeys")'
----


*Impact—* Previously generated alerts for disk with double encryption will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-41270</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS IAM role/user with unused CloudTrail delete or full permission* The RQL has been updated to check that varname:[roleName] and varname:[userName] exists which narrows down the search results to only applicable entities.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-iam-service-last-accessed-details' AND json.rule = '(arn contains :role or arn contains :user) and serviceLastAccesses[?any(serviceNamespace contains cloudtrail and totalAuthenticatedEntities any equal 0)] exists' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = 'document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Action[*] contains DeleteTrail or Action contains DeleteTrail or Action contains cloudtrail:* or Action[*] contains cloudtrail:*))] exists' as Y; filter '($.Y.entities.policyRoles[*].roleName exists and $.X.arn contains $.Y.entities.policyRoles[*].roleName) or ($.Y.entities.policyUsers[*].userName exists and $.X.arn contains $.Y.entities.policyUsers[*].userName)'; show X;]
----

*Impact—* Some alerts might be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-40955</draft-comment>+++

|*Prisma Cloud Data Security for AWS Organization Account*
|Prisma Cloud creates two separate sets of AWS resources based on whether your onboarded account is an individual account or an organization account.

After you’ve onboarded your AWS Organization on Prisma Cloud, you can now https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/enable-data-security-module/enable-data-security-for-aws-org-account.html[Enable Data Security].

+++<draft-comment>RLP-40447, RLP-42869</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[Update] *Prisma Cloud Data Security Scan Options*
|The new *Exposure only* scanning option scans objects to detect public exposure only and is charged at 5 credits per TB. If you select the *Full* (Exposure, Sensitive, and Malware) scan option, public exposure scanning will be charged for all selected data at 5 credits per TB while only https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/supported-file-extensions.html[classifiable] data will be charged for the full 30 credits per TB.

Free data is updated to 3 credits, i.e. 100GB of *Full* (Exposure, Sensitive, and Malware) scanning or 600GB of *Exposure only* scanning.

The scan quota metrics are updated from TB to credits to align with the new scan option, with the default set at 1,500 credits, i.e. 50TB. If you had previously defined your scan quota in TB, your settings will be retained and converted to the equivalent credits.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-42993</draft-comment>+++


|*Configuration Status Information in Data Security Scan Settings*
|For better awareness, the *Configuration Status* column displays screen:[Contains log] for buckets, even if they cannot be scanned.

The recently configured resources can only be updated again after 24 hours.


|tt:[Update] *Permission for GCP Cloud Accounts Onboarded to Prisma Cloud*
|If you have onboarded GCP Organization or projects on Prisma Cloud, you must perform the following actions:

* Enable Google’s Cloud Asset API *cloudasset.googleapis.com* on the project where the service account is created. This API must be enabled to ensure that Prisma Cloud can ingest data for the Key Management Service (KMS) and Pub/Sub service.

* If the service account does not include the Viewer role and all the permissions associated with the primitive role, you must add the *cloudasset.assets.search.AllIamPolicies* and *cloudasset.assets.search.AllResources* to your service account.

You must enable the API and provide adequate permissions to the service account to ensure that the IAM policy metadata associated with the Pub/Sub APIs and IAM policy for KMS APIs continue to be ingested on Prisma Cloud.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-42557</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[IAM Security] *Support for IAM Role Trust Relationshsips*
|Prisma Cloud now supports IAM Role Trust Relationships, which enables you to gain visibility into the principals that can assume a role in your AWS account. The calculation for net effective permission now includes the role trust relationships in the screen:[config from iam where] RQL results on the *Investigate* page.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-43712</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[New] *JSON Array Operator in RQL*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ecs-describe-task-definition' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and (executionRoleArn does not exist or executionRoleArn contains <none> or (executionRoleArn does not start with arn:aws:iam and executionRoleArn does not start with arn:aws-us-gov:iam))
----


*Impact—* Reduced number of alerts because RQL checks gov cloud account-specific arn.

[#id9c55ba3c-98f4-49f8-9d55-c03d6c3b0dfb]
=== REST API Updates

[cols="33%a,67%a"]
|===
|Change
|Description


|tt:[New] *AWS Organization data security*
|New API endpoints are available to configure data security for AWS Organizations. You can use these endpoints for data security configuration after AWS Organization onboarding. The new endpoints are:

* userinput:[POST /dlp/api/config/v2] 
+
Creates a data security configuration for an AWS Organization
* userinput:[PUT /dlp/api/config/v2] 
+
Updates a data security configuration for an AWS Organization
* userinput:[GET /dlp/api/config/v2] 
+
Returns a data security configuration for an AWS Organization
* userinput:[POST /dlp/api/v1/config/awsorg/status] 
+
Checks if preconditions are met for creation of a data security configuration for an AWS Organization


|tt:[New] *Data security scan options for resources*
|The request object for the following endpoint includes a new optional parameter varname:[scanOption], which enables the caller to specify data security scanning capabilities:

* userinput:[PUT /dlp/api/config/v2/resource] 


|tt:[New] *IAM Security API*
|A new Prisma Cloud identity and access management (IAM) security API is now available. When the Prisma Cloud IAM module is enabled, you can use this API to investigate IAM entities in your AWS environment. This API also enables you to test Prisma Cloud integration with Okta.


|*Replacement of deprecated data security endpoint*
|The following endpoint has been removed:

* userinput:[GET /dlp/api/v1/object-inventory/resources] 

The replacement endpoint is as follows and uses the same request parameters as the endpoint it replaces:

* userinput:[GET /dlp/api/v1/resource-inventory/resources] 

In addition, the following changes exist in the varname:[StorageResource] object:

* Attribute varname:[accountId] replaces varname:[accountNumber]

* Attribute varname:[redlockAccountId] replaces varname:[accountId]

The following endpoint has a request parameter, varname:[resources], which is a varname:[StorageResource] object and therefore includes the two changed attributes:

* userinput:[PUT /dlp/api/config/v2/resource] 


|*Response attribute change for endpoint to get cloud account status*
|The response object for the following endpoint has changed:

* userinput:[PUT /cloud/status/{cloud_type}] 

The response object continues to have the same attributes, but attribute varname:[statusMessage] no longer reports the number of accounts.
