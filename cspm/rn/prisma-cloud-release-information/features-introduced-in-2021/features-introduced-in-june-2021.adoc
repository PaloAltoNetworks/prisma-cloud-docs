|*Support for AWS Cape Town and AWS Osaka*
|Prisma Cloud can now ingest data for resources deployed in the Cape Town and Osaka regions on AWS.

To review a list of supported regions, select menu:Inventory[Assets > Cloud Region].

+++<draft-comment>RLP-39905</draft-comment>+++


|*Service Accounts*
|Prisma Cloud is adding support for service accounts to help with your automation needs. Service accounts differ from the standard user accounts in that you don't need to associate an email address with them and they do not have to be validated or activated before use. With this capability, you can now use a non-human entity to interact programmatically with the Prisma Cloud APIs directly.

Only System Administrators can create Prisma Cloud service accounts. When you add a service account (menu:Settings[Users > Add New > Service Account]), you must specify a name, a role, and a time zone. To enable key rotation, a service account can have up to two access keys. The audit logs record all activity performed by the associated access keys and attribute them directly to the service account.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-41067</draft-comment>+++


|*Resource Tag for Filtering Alerts*
|The new *Resource Tag* filter on menu:Alerts[Overview], enables you to filter for alerts that pertain to resources with the specified tag value. When you add the new filter and specify a userinput:[key:value] , the results on the page update to list the alerts that match the resource tag.

The Resource Tag syntax uses a colon, userinput:[:] to separate the key and value to match, performs an exact match; it does not support white spaces or wildcard characters. You can multiple key:value pairs, or use the key without the userinput:[:] and an associated value to find all values that match the key.

The key:value is free-form text. Log in to the cloud service provider environment and find the exact tags for your resource to confirm.

=== New Policies and Policy Updates

[cols="32%a,68%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS ECS Cluster instance volume encryption for data at rest is disabled* Identifies the ECS Cluster instance volumes for which encryption for data at rest is disabled. Encrypting data at rest reduces unintentional exposure of data and prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data on your AWS ECS clusters. As a best practice, configure encryption for your ECS cluster instance volumes using an encryption key.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ecs-container-instance' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-volumes' AND json.rule = state contains in-use and encrypted is false as Y; filter '$.Y.attachments[*].instanceId contains $.X.ec2InstanceId'; show Y;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38842</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS Elasticsearch domain is not configured with HTTPS* Identifies Elasticsearch domains that are not configured with HTTPS. Amazon Elasticsearch domains allow all traffic to be submitted over HTTPS, ensuring all communications between application and domain are encrypted. As a best practice, enable HTTPS so that all communication between the application and all data access goes across an encrypted communication channel to eliminate man-in-the-middle attacks.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-es-describe-elasticsearch-domain' AND json.rule = processing is false and domainEndpointOptions.enforceHTTPS is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38375</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS EC2 instance detailed monitoring disabled* Identifies EC2 instances that have detailed monitoring disabled. With detailed monitoring, you can also get aggregated data across groups of similar EC2 instances; it is therefore a best practice to enable detailed monitoring for your production instances.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-instances' AND json.rule = state.name equals running and monitoring.state equals disabled
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36398</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS IAM policy allows decryption actions on all KMS keys* Identifies IAM policies that allow decryption actions on all KMS keys. Instead of granting permissions for all keys, determine the minimum set of keys that users need in order to access encrypted data. You should grant to identities only the varname:[kms:Decrypt] or varname:[kms:ReEncryptFrom] permissions and only for the keys that are required to perform a task. By adopting the principle of least privilege, you can reduce the risk of unintended disclosure of your data.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Resource equals * and (Action contains kms:* or Action contains kms:Decrypt or Action contains kms:ReEncryptFrom) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>@matangi, i don’t recall there being a tag documented in Confluence for permissions so decided on var as it’s used to tag query parameters in the deprecation notice which is the closest thing I found to permissions. We can discuss if needed.</draft-comment>+++

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35081</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS CloudWatch Log groups encrypted using default encryption key instead of KMS CMK* Identifies CloudWatch Log groups that are encrypted using default encryption key instead of Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Master Key (CMK). As a best practice, use Customer Master Keys (CMK) to encrypt the data in your CloudWatch Log groups to ensure full control over your data.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-cloudwatch-log-group' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' as Y; filter '($.X.kmsKeyId does not exist) or ($.X.kmsKeyId exists and $.Y.keyMetadata.keyState equals Disabled) and $.X.kmsKeyId equals $.Y.keyMetadata.arn'; show X;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-295</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS VPC endpoint policy is overly permissive* Identifies VPC endpoints that have a VPC endpoint (VPCE) policy that is overly permissive. When the Principal element value is set to (*{asterisk}*) within the access policy, the VPC endpoint allows full access to any IAM user or service within the VPC using credentials from any AWS account. As a best practice, use the least privileged VPCE policy to protect against data leakage and unauthorized access.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-describe-vpc-endpoints' AND json.rule = policyDocument.Statement[?any( Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Action contains * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>@matangi: not sure what’s the proper way to introduce a symbol like an asterisk. So, I decided to wrap it in parens and bold it so that readers know to focus on the symbol. Not including the parens looked like a typo to be when editing the pdf.</draft-comment>+++

+++<draft-comment>RLP-280</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP App Engine Identity-Aware Proxy is disabled* Identifies GCP App Engine applications for which Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is disabled. IAP is used to enforce access control policies for applications and resources, and works with signed headers for the App Engine standard environment to secure your app. As a best practice, enable Identity-Aware Proxy for securing the App Engine.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-app-engine-application' AND json.rule = servingStatus equals SERVING and (iap does not exist or iap.enabled does not exist or iap.enabled is false)
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-6678</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL and Metadata*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38765</draft-comment>+++

+++<draft-comment>@matangi: usually just copy/paste items from look ahead, but did some reformatting as I had doubts about the formatting. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rHQkQbYKDT4878CAo5EUoNAtLHnCgjRo/view?usp=sharing</draft-comment>+++

|*Amazon Elasticsearch*

*Changes—* The policy RQL and recommendation steps have been updated.

If the processing state of AWS Elasticsearch is false, it implies it is in active state and will be reported. The RQL for the following policies have been enhanced to give precise alerts by only checking the 'processing' state of AWS Elasticsearch:

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain Encryption for data at rest is disabled* 

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain has Zone Awareness set to disabled*

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain has Dedicated master set to disabled*

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain has Search slow logs set to disabled*

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain has Index slow logs set to disabled* 

The recommendation steps for the following policies has been updated as per the AWS GUI changes:

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain Encryption for data at rest is disabled*

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain has Zone Awareness set to disabled*

* *AWS Elasticsearch domain has Dedicated master set to disabled*

*Impact—* Alerts generated previously for non-active resources will be deleted as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38765</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS Elasticsearch domain publicly accessible*

*Changes—* The policy RQL has been enhanced by adding an extra processing status check to optimize alerts count. The recommendation steps have also been updated as the AWS GUI has changed.

*Impact—* Alerts generated previously for non-processing resources will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38372</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy deletion—Similar RQL*
|*AWS ElasticSearch cluster not in a VPC* policy is deleted

*Changes—* The *AWS ElasticSearch cluster not in a VPC* policy and its respective compliance mappings have been deleted; it was reporting the same resources as the *AWS Elasticsearch domain publicly accessible* policy which will stay.

*Impact—* Alerts related to the *AWS ElasticSearch cluster not in a VPC* policy will be resolved as Policy_Deleted.

|DESCRIPTION


|*JSON Preview*
|*JSON Preview* available for configuration queries only, simplifies the JSON selection experience by creating a visually interactive experience where you can see the full JSON configuration schema based on the API you select in your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/config-query/config-query-attributes.html[Config query]. JSON Preview makes query building a keyboard-less process where you can create a complex query without manually typing each character.

In this release, JSON Preview is disabled, by default. Toggle *JSON Preview* on the *Investigate* page to start using it.

[NOTE]
====
This is not yet available for the OCI APIs.

|*Storage Estimate Retrieval Schedule*
|The menu:Settings[Data > Scan Settings] page provides an estimate of the total data in the S3 bucket, and the volume of data eligible for sensitive data scanning, malware scanning, or both based on the supported file types and file size. Previously, these values got updated weekly. You can now set the estimate retrieval schedule to either *Daily*, *Weekly* (default), or *None*. This is a tenant-level configuration and the schedule you set will affect all the accounts under that tenant. You can change the schedule once every 24 hours.

|*List Cloud Account Owners*
|On the Cloud Accounts page, Prisma Cloud displays the number of *Cloud Account Owners* for a given account. It is a collapsed view that displays only the first owner’s email address. Clicking the number link, for example, *+3 more*, opens a pop-up that lists the cloud account owner email addresses in an alphabetical order for that account.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-16485</draft-comment>+++


|*Support for Azure Resource Groups on Compliance and Inventory Dashboards*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36874</draft-comment>+++
|Prisma Cloud now enables you to create resource lists for http://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/add-a-resource-list-on-prisma-cloud.html[Azure Resource Groups]. When a resource list is attached to a role, that role will have access to only that data in the resource list which thereby restricts user permissions.

After you onboard your Azure subscriptions the corresponding resource lists are automatically ingested and can be filtered in the Compliance and Asset Inventory dashboards for granular visibility into your Azure resources. You can view the data on your Azure assets for specific resource lists or generate custom compliance reports for only the resource lists you selected.

You can reach out to Prisma Cloud Customer Success if you want to try it on your Prisma Cloud instance.

|tt:[Update] *Ingestion for aws-iam-service-last-accessed-details*
|The default interval for ingesting resources of *aws-iam-service-last-accessed-details* API for all users, roles, and policies is updated to once in 24 hours.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-39374</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[Update] *Ingestion for aws-iam-get-policy-version*
|For the *aws-iam-get-policy-version* API, Prisma Cloud currently ingests all policies including *Unattached AWS Managed Policies*. Starting with 21.6.2, any Unattached AWS Managed Policies, which are policies that are not attached to any group, user, or role, are no longer ingested on Prisma Cloud.

With this change, the metadata is not available for RQL queries and therefore, you cannot create custom policies for Unattached AWS Managed Policies.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS CloudWatch Log groups not configured with definite retention days* Identifies CloudWatch Log groups that are not configured with definite retention days. The retention period should be used to specify how long log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. Expired log events get deleted automatically. If the retention period is not configured then logs will be retained indefinitely which increases the cost. Different log groups may require different retention periods, depending on operational and regulatory constraints. It is recommended to set a definite retention period for each CloudWatch Log group depending on your operational and regulatory constraints instead of being retained indefinitely.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-cloudwatch-log-group' AND json.rule = retentionInDays does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36787</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster encryption not configured with CMK key* Identifies ElastiCache Redis clusters that are encrypted using the default KMS key instead of Customer Managed CMK (Customer Master Key) or the CMK key used for encryption is disabled. As a security best practice, enabled CMK should be used instead of the default KMS key for encryption to gain the ability to rotate the key according to your own policies, delete the key, and control access to the key via KMS policies and IAM policies.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elasticache-describe-replication-groups' AND json.rule = status equals available and atRestEncryptionEnabled is true as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' as Y; filter '($.X.kmsKeyId does not exist) or ($.X.kmsKeyId exists and $.Y.keyMetadata.keyState equals Disabled) and $.X.kmsKeyId equals $.Y.keyMetadata.arn'; show X;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-9975</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS IAM policy is overly permissive to all traffic via condition clause* Identifies IAM policies that have a policy that is overly permissive to all traffic via condition clause. If any IAM policy statement that has a condition containing *0.0.0.0/0* or *::/0*, it allows all traffic to resources attached to that IAM policy. It is highly recommended to have the least privileged IAM policy to protect data leakage and unauthorized access.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = document.Statement[?any((Condition.ForAnyValue:IpAddress.aws:SourceIp contains 0.0.0.0/0 or Condition.IpAddress.aws:SourceIp contains 0.0.0.0/0 or Condition.IpAddress.aws:SourceIp contains ::/0 or Condition.ForAnyValue:IpAddress.aws:SourceIp contains ::/0) and Effect equals Allow and Action contains *)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-32063</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS IAM policy overly permissive to STS services* Identifies IAM policies that are overly permissive to STS services. AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). It is recommended to follow the principle of least privileges ensuring only restricted STS services for restricted resources.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = isAttached is true and document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action contains sts:* and Resource equals * and Condition does not exist)] exists

|*Policy Updates—RQL and Metadata*
|*AWS EC2 instance allowing public IP in subnets*The RQL has been updated to check subnet levels instead of route table rules. The policy name, description, and recommendation have been updated accordingly.

*Impact—* New alerts will be generated based on current configurations and previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38493</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS ECS/Fargate task definition execution IAM Role not found*The policy RQL has been updated with an extra status check to report only active resources, and the policy name has been updated to remove an extra space.

*Impact—* Alerts generated previously for non-active resources will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-37333</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS ECS task definition elevated privileges enabled*The policy RQL has been enhanced with a status check to report only running resources. The policy description has also been updated.

*Impact—* Alerts generated previously for non-running resources will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38210</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS Security Group allows all traffic on ports which are not commonly used*The policy RQL has been enhanced to check for the additional ports 1194 and 5672. The policy description has been updated accordingly.

*Impact—* New alerts might be raised for newly added ports according to the configurations.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38208</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Key Vault Audit Logging is disabled*The policy recommendation has been updated as per the changes in Azure.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

|*Hitrust v.9.4: New Compliance support AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI*
|The HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) is a prescriptive set of controls that meet the requirements of multiple regulations and standards. The framework provides a way to comply with standards, such as ISO/IEC 27000-series and HIPAA. Since the HITRUST CSF incorporates various security, privacy, and other regulatory requirements from existing frameworks and standards, some organizations utilize this framework to demonstrate their security and compliance in a consistent and streamlined manner. Organizations can complete a self-assessment using the HITRUST framework, or they can engage with a HITRUST assessor for an external, third-party engagement.

|DESCRIPTION


|*Condition support for IAM Security*

+++<draft-comment>RN blurb for RLP-38635</draft-comment>+++
|The IAM Security module now supports conditions which enable you to apply conditions when you use the userinput:[config from iam where] https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/iam-query.html[query].

For example, you can look for a specific condition within the JSON metadata:

----
config from iam where source.public = true AND grantedby.cloud.policy.condition('aws:SourceIp', 'IpAddress') exists 
----


image::raw-condition-permission.png[scale=40]

A range of RQL operators are supported to filter results.


|*Support for Onboarding Azure Resource Hierarchy*

+++<draft-comment>RN blurb for RLP-36837</draft-comment>+++
|You can now build a flexible structure of https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/add-azure-active-directory-on-prisma-cloud.html[management groups] and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy.

Prisma Cloud supports the ability to onboard all or a subset of cloud resources based on how they are grouped under management groups and subscriptions.

This capability is available across all Azure Commercial, Government, and China regions.

image::azure-management-susbcriptions.png[scale=60]


|*Addition of Non-Onboarded Account IDs to an Account Group*
|If you have an Alibaba, AWS, Azure, or GCP account that is not being monitored on Prisma Cloud, you can manually add the Account IDs as a string to an existing account group or to a new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-account-groups.html[account group]. These accounts, called *Non-Onboarded Account IDs*, are then available for users who have access to the *Compute* tab. You can assign these accounts to roles and enable granular access to data and configuration on the Compute tab.

|The *Compute Access Group* resource list provides you the ability to enable granular access to a specified list of Compute workloads or resources such as images, code repositories, or hosts instead of granting access to all resources within an account. When you create a resource list on Prisma Cloud (menu:Settings[Resource Lists], you can assign it to a role. The workloads you include in the list match criteria are within scope and accessible to the https://docs.prismacloudcompute.com/docs/enterprise_edition/authentication/assign_roles.html#assigning-roles-to-user[user who is assigned to the role].

On Prisma Cloud Compute, this resource list is referred to as an assigned collection that allows the user to view data on the resources to which you assigned access.

The resource list is automatically added to the list of Collections (menu:Manage[Collections and Tags > Collections]). Although the Resource List for Compute Access Group is included in the list of collections, you cannot edit it on the Compute tab or use it when you add or edit rules for enforcing security checks on your resources.


|tt:[Limited GA] *Alert Notifications for All States*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-39023</draft-comment>+++
|Prisma Cloud can now send notifications to external integrations for all states—Open, Dismissed,Resolved, Snoozed—when the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/alert-notifications-state-changes.html[status of an alert changes].

This feature requires the alerts version 2.0 subsystem and is in ^Limited GA^; You can reach out to Prisma Cloud Customer Success if you want to try it on your Prisma Cloud instance.

All integrations except Jira and Cortex XSOAR support notifications for all states.


|tt:[Update] *Alert Notifications to External Integrations*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36850</draft-comment>+++
|If you have configured Prisma Cloud to send alert notifications to any external integration such as email or Splunk, the link in the URL is formatted differently. The link includes the selected filters as an array, instead of as a string, in the query. For example:

Behavior was— alerts/overview#alert.status=open&policy.name=${value}

New Behavior: alerts/overview#alert.status[]=open&policy.name[]=${value}

[NOTE]
====
With this change, all links from notifications that were sent previously will no longer work.

|*Automated Remediation*
|As announced in the 21.5.1 release notes, Prisma Cloud is rolling out https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-release-notes/prisma-cloud-release-information/features-introduced-in-2021/features-introduced-in-may-2021.html#id3426a14f-ae9a-4ff3-afe7-dbbe38491f63_idff3ef170-937f-4460-806e-43b9a42bf8f9[Alerts 2.0], and the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/configure-prisma-cloud-to-automatically-remediate-alerts.html[automated remediation] behavior is different, depending on whether you are on the alert subsystem version 1.0 or 2.0:

* Alerts 2.0—When you enable auto-remediation on version 2.0, all applicable open alerts regardless of when they were generated are fixed, and the alert status is updated as *Resolved*.

* Alerts 1.0—When you enable auto-remediation on version 1.0, the CLI commands are only executed for resources where alerts were generated or updated in the last 24 hours. Alerts that were generated before the 24-hour period will not be auto remediated.

To identify the alerts subsystem version, check menu:Alerts[Overview]. If the *Version: 2* label displays on the top right above the Search box, you are not on version 1.
