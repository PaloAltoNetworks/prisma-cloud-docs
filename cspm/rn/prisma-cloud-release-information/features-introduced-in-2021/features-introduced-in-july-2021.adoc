|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|tt:[Limited GA] *Support for Cloud Account Group Hierarchy With Nested Account Groups*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-38677</draft-comment>+++
|Prisma Cloud now supports https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-account-groups[nested account groups] which enables you to nest, or, place account groups inside of each other. Organizations now have greater flexibility in how they map out their internal hierarchy and delegate permissions and alert rules.

Create a nested account group by creating a parent and then add children to it. Select menu:Settings[Account Groups > Add Account Group], and then create a parent account group by entering *Name* and tt:[Description]; select *Make this a parent account group*, and then select the account groups that you want to be its children.

The hierarchy (image::child-account-included-in-parent-account-group.png[scale=60]) icon indicates that the account group you're trying to add is already included as a child of another parent. If you select such an account group in a new parent account group the child account will be migrated from the existing parent account group to the new one. This might result in alerts getting resolved since the account group might not be processed under the new parent.

Prisma Cloud supports nested account groups 10-levels deep, and with 300-accounts at each level. Contact Prisma Cloud customer support to enable this feature on your tenant.

|tt:[Limited GA] *Support for Azure Resource Groups*
|Support for Azure Resource Groups provides another level of role-based access or grouping in Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud now enables you to create Azure Resource Groups under menu:Settings[Resource Lists]. When a https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/add-a-resource-list-on-prisma-cloud.html[Resource List] with one or more Azure Resource Groups is created and attached to a role, users with that role will only have access to the assets and alert data in the Resource List thereby restricting their purview. You can filter based on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal[Azure Resource Groups] on the Asset Inventory page, the Investigate page, the Compliance pages, the Alerts Overview, and Alert and Compliance Reports.

[NOTE]
====
On the Sec Ops dashboard, Azure Resource Groups is not available as an explicit filter. However, the results shown will be implicitly filtered based on the Azure Resource Groups that are applied to the user's role when they log in to Prisma Cloud.
====

image::azure-resource-group-asset-inv-1.png[scale=40]

Only System Admins can create Resource Groups. You can reach out to Prisma Cloud Customer Success if you want to try it on your Prisma Cloud instance.

|tt:[Update] *Improvement to the UEBA models and anomaly detection*
|The UEBA models and anomaly detection capabilities on Prisma cloud are being improved to include *assumerole* events by default. As a result, if you have *assumerole* events in your logs, you may see an increase in the number of alerts generated for the *Unusual User Activity* and *Account Hijacking Attempts* policies.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-42069</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[Update] *ServiceNow Notification Template*
|You can use the following additional variables while configuring notifications using the ServiceNow template:

* AccountAncestors

* AccountOwners

* GCP_ResourceLabel

Notifications sent to Google Cloud Security Command Center (CSCC), Azure Queuing Service (AQS), Splunk, and Webhook will also contain:

* AccountAncestors

* AccountOwners

image::snow-notification-template-1.png[scale=40]

You must be on the Alerts subsystem 2.0 to be able to use these additional variables.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-41243</draft-comment>+++


|*Integration with Amazon S3*
|You can https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-amazon-s3.html[integrate Amazon S3] with Prisma Cloud to get notifications for configuration, audit, and anomaly policy violations.

image::s3-integration.png[scale=50]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-41391</draft-comment>+++


|*Alerts Visualization*
|The three new visualizations on the *Alerts Overview* page are alert aggregations that help you decide which alerts to address first:

* *Alert Coverage—* across various policies

* *Alerts By Severity—* high, medium, and low

* *Top Incidents & Risks*

image::alerts-visualizations.png[scale=50]

+++<draft-comment>RLP-31842</draft-comment>+++


|*GCP Ancestry Information in the Alert Payload*
|The GCP ancestry owner information is now available directly in the Alert Payload. It is displayed on the Alerts L2 page and is also included in the notifications.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-40005</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[Update] *Ingestion for azure-event-hub-namespace*
|The structure of the following Prisma API has been modified:

*azure-event-hub-namespace*

The JSON attributes *firewallRules* and *virtualNetworkRules*, which used to be present at the root level are now moved under the *networkRuleSet* JSON block; the *firewallRules* attribute is now renamed to *ipRules*. The *zoneRedundant* attribute which was previously under the properties section is now removed.

*Impact—* There are Prisma Cloud System default policies that are impacted by this change. If you have custom policies, you must review the change in the JSON metadata structure and update the RQL for your custom policy.

[#id52c26c06-fd19-413d-bade-024edc76171b]
=== New Policies and Policy Updates

This release includes several important updates to Prisma Cloud Policies that results in a noticeable reduction in alert volume and significantly improves accuracy of the cloud misconfiguration alerts:

* RQL updates of 18 Configuration policies
* Deletion of 4 Configuration policies
* Deletion of 12 Audit policies

You will see many of the related policy violation alerts resolved immediately after the PCS 21.7.2 upgrade. Review the following list to note the policy deletions and RQL updates implemented and view the https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies/pull/22/files[GitHub changelog].

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policy*
|*Network Data Exfiltration Activity*

This new network anomaly detection policy uses machine learning to learn the normal traffic pattern of each virtual machine and alerts when there is an abnormal amount of egress traffic to known TOR exit nodes.

|
|*AWS EBS volume region with encryption is disabled*

Identifies AWS regions in which newly created EBS volumes are not encrypted using an encryption key.

It provides coverage for CIS v1.4.0 (AWS) section 2.2.1 and is a replacement for the existing *AWS EBS volumes are not encrypted* policy, which was earlier mapped to this CIS section. *AWS EBS volume region with encryption is disabled* is also mapped to other relevant compliance standards.

*AWS EBS volumes are not encrypted* will be deleted in this release.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Account Owner Details For Azure and GCP Accounts*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-40014</draft-comment>+++
|Prisma Cloud now displays the account owners associated with the Azure and GCP cloud accounts in a new column in the details from menu:Alerts[Overview].

When you filter for the GCP and Azure cloud types on menu:Alerts[Overview], and click the link in the *Alerts* column, the *Violating Resources* table displays.

The *Account Owners*column displays up to five account owners associated with a cloud account in alphabetical order; this column will display by default, but if no values are present then this column will be grayed out. For offline access, when you download (image::download-alerts.png[scale=60]) the list of resources the *Account Owners* information is included in the CSV file.

You must be on the Alerts subsystem 2.0 to view the account owner column. To identify the alerts subsystem version on your Prisma Cloud instance, select menu:Alerts[Overview] and check for the *Version: 2* above the filter (image::prisma-cloud-add-filter-icon.png[scale=60]) icon.

|*Support for Europe Central 2 region on GCP*
|Prisma Cloud can now ingest data on your resources deployed in the GCP Warsaw region 'Europe Central 2'.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-40656</draft-comment>+++


|*Filters—* tt:[Change in Behavior]
|When saving filters on menu:Alerts[Overview], the time range is saved with the other filters you apply and the choices are preserved for the session.

If you apply a saved filter that has fewer filters than your current preserved session, the additional filters will remain but the selections will be cleared out so that they are not applied, and you will see a combination of your saved filters and your current session filters.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*Azure Active Directory Security Defaults is disabled*
|Identifies Azure AD that has security defaults disabled which could impact alerts being generated for all Azure AD with this setting. This policy is mapped to CIS Azure 1.2.0, section 1.3.0, compliance standard 1.22.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-enforcement-policy' AND json.rule = isEnabled is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-37646</draft-comment>+++


|*Azure AD Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is enabled*
|Identifies Azure AD which has the following setting enabled: *Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf*. This could impact alerts being generated for all Azure AD which has this setting enabled. This policy is mapped to CIS Azure 1.1.0, sections 1.2.0 and 1.3.0, compliance standard 1.9.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = permissionGrantPolicyIdsAssignedToDefaultUserRole[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-37645</draft-comment>+++


|*GCP Storage Bucket should not log to itself*
|Identifies GCP storage buckets that are sending logs to themselves. When storage buckets use the same bucket to send their access logs, a loop of logs will be created which is not recommended. As a best practice, spin up new and different log buckets for storage bucket logging.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name= 'gcloud-storage-buckets-list' AND json.rule = logging.logBucket equals $.name
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-37656</draft-comment>+++


|*GCP Storage Bucket is not configured with default event-based hold*
|Identifies GCP storage buckets that are not configured with default event-based hold. This setting enables you to protect individual objects which allows an object to persist in your bucket for a specified length of time after a given event occurs.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36177</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy descriptions update*
|The following policies descriptions have been updated:

* *AWS EMR cluster is not enabled with local disk encryption using CMK*

* *AWS EMR cluster is not enabled with local disk encryption*

The word *slave* was removed from the policy description.

*Impact—* No changes on alerts.
