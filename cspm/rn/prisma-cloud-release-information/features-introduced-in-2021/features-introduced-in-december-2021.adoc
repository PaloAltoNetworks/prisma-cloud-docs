|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Custom Payload for Webhook Integration*
|If you are using a Webhook integration to send Prisma Cloud alerts, you can now customize the alert payload. When you enable the option to configure a custom payload, you have a new JSON editor in the Webhook integration (menu:Settings[Integrations]). This editor allows you to modify the format for the attributes or tokens included in the alert payload. For your convenience, it also provides a brief description of each attribute.

The error messages are also improved to help you confirm that the integrations is set up successfully or identify any misconfiguration.

|tt:[Limited GA] *True Network Exposure of Cloud Assets*
|The cloud network analyzer engine on Prisma Cloud helps you determine the true network exposure of your cloud assets and take action to secure them from network threats with an end-to-end network path analysis between the source and destination resource.

Using the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/network-query.html[new RQL query]on the *Investigate* page, you can understand the reachability of your cloud assets and also validate if someone exploited the overly permissive network access. This is currently supported only on AWS.

|*Ability to Reference External Variables within the Scope of a Nested Rule*
|Nested Rules using the ?any quantifier limited the conditions you could write on the elements of an array. For RQL policies that use nested rules, you can now add a condition referencing an external JSON path inside the nested rule.

This is also useful when a https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/operators.html[Join operator] is expressed among two different paths in a JSON specimen, which requires the nested rules to check on values outside the scope of the quantifier.

The following operators are supported with a variable path ($.path) on the right-hand side:

* contains
* does not contain
* equals
* does not equal

|*Prisma Cloud Data Security- ‘Sensitive Data and Malware in Publicly Exposed Objects’ Scan Option*
|You can now scan for *Sensitive Data and Malware in Publicly Exposed Objects* while configuring data security scan settings. On selecting this option, Prisma Cloud scans all objects for public exposure first and then scans only the publicly exposed objects for sensitive data and malware.

On clicking Apply, you can see the selected scan option under the *Scan Capability* column and the corresponding line under the *Configuration Status* column shows as Recently configured.

|*Prisma Cloud Data Security- Simplified ‘Forward Scan’ Setup*
|Prisma Cloud now provides a simplified way to set up Forward Scan that reduces the number of manual steps that were required during onboarding. You can choose either an existing CloudTrail or create a new one with an associated SNS Topic.

A script file is generated based on the information you provide, which you can execute on CloudShell that sets up all of the configuration required for a successful Forward Scan.

Setting up a simplified *Forward Scan* prevents manual errors and you can validate the setup before proceeding with the rest of the onboarding.

==== New Policies and Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*Instance affected by Apache Log4j vulnerability is exposed to network traffic from the internet [CVE-2021-44228]*

Identifies instances installed with Apache Log4j (<2.16.0) version vulnerable for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-44228) and exposed to network traffic from the internet. As a best practice, upgrade the Apache Log4j version to the latest version and limit exposure to the internet.

----
network from vpc.flow_record where bytes > 0 AND source.resource IN ( resource where finding.type IN ( 'Host Vulnerability' ) AND finding.source IN ( 'Prisma Cloud' ) AND finding.name IN ('CVE-2021-44228') ) AND destination.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs')
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-54445</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP Cloud Function not enabled with VPC connector*

Identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are not configured with a VPC connector. VPC connector helps functions to connect to a resource inside a VPC in the same project.

Setting up the VPC connector enables you to set up a secure perimeter to guard against data exfiltration and prevent functions from accidentally sending any data to unwanted destinations. As a best practice, configure the GCP Cloud Function with a VPC connector.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-cloud-function' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and vpcConnector does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-41838</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[Limited GA] *True Network Exposure Policies*
|The following five policies are being released in limited GA for a set of beta customers:

*AWS EC2 instance is exposed to the internet*

Identifies EC2 instances that are exposed to inbound traffic from the Internet. Exposure to the Internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and effective.action = 'Allowed' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/0:79', 'tcp/81:442', 'tcp/444:65535' ) 
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-48046</draft-comment>+++

*AWS EC2 instance allows outbound access to the internet*

Identifies EC2 instances that allow outbound traffic to the Internet. As a best practice, restrict outbound traffic and limit access to known hosts or services.

----
config from network where source.resource.type = 'Instance' and source.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-48063</draft-comment>+++

*AWS RDS instances exposed to internet*

Identifies network interfaces attached to RDS instance that are exposed to inbound traffic from the Internet. RDS instances exposed to the Internet are prone to external security threats. As a best practice, restrict network interfaces which are attached to the RDS instance to known hosts or services only.

----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'Interface' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.network.interface.owner in ( 'amazon-rds')
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-48701</draft-comment>+++

*AWS Redshift instances exposed to internet*

Identifies network interfaces attached to Redshift cluster that are exposed to inbound traffic from the internet. Redshift clusters exposed to the internet are prone to external security threats. As a best practice, restrict network interfaces which are attached to the Redshift cluster to known hosts or services only

----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'Interface' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.network.interface.owner in ( 'amazon-redshift' )
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-48702</draft-comment>+++

*AWS EC2 instance reachable from untrust internet source on SSH/RDP port (TCP)*

Identifies EC2 instances that are reachable from internet on SSH or RDP ports. The SSH or RDP port exposed to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/22' , 'tcp/3389' )
----
