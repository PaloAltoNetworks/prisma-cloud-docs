|tt:[Limited GA]IAM Security
|https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security.html[Prisma Cloud IAM Security] automatically calculates effective permissions across cloud service providers, detects overly permissive access and suggests corrections to reach least privilege entitlements. It includes out-of-the-box policies that govern IAM best practices to help you identify risky permissions and get to the ideal set of privileges for your deployment.

If you use Okta as your IdP, enable the Okta integration to federate user identity easily. Prisma Cloud ingests single sign-on (SSO) data for an effective permissions calculation and lists the effective permissions of Okta users across cloud accounts. You can then leverage RQL and query for identity-related entitlements and events to investigate and address issues to gain control over your cloud entitlements.


|Suppression of Anomaly Alerts for Trusted Resources
|The Anomaly Trusted List includes support for more resources for which you can https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/suppress-alerts-for-prisma-cloud-anomaly-policies.html[suppress alerts]. You can now specify a Machine Image ID, Tag associated with a cloud resource, Cloud Service name, or a Resource identifier for supported cloud providers, and list the anomaly policies against which you do not want to generate alerts.

For example, if the JSON metadata for your VM on Azure has the following tag:You must provide the key and the value from the JSON element as the *Key* and the *Value* when you add the tag to the Anomaly Trusted list.

----
"tags": {
  "purpose": "ds-flowlogs-bucket"
}
Key = purpose
Value = ds-flowlogs-bucket

|Support for APRA CPS 234 Compliance Standard
|Prisma Cloud adds support for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) Prudential Standard CPS 234 regulatory standard. This Prudential Standard aims to ensure that an APRA-regulated entity takes measures to be resilient against information security incidents (including cyber attacks) by maintaining an information security capability commensurate with information security vulnerabilities and threats. The Prisma Cloud default policies that are mapped to this standard enable continuous monitoring of your organization’s cyber risk profile.

|Custom Data Patterns and Data Profiles for Prisma Cloud Data Security
|Prisma Cloud Data Security is GA now! Beyond the predefined data patterns and profiles, you now can define a https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/data-policies.html[data pattern] from scratch, and also create a https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/data-policies.html[data profile] with a collection of data patterns that meet your content scanning needs on menu:Settings[Data].image::dlp-data-patterns-profiles.png[scale=40]

A data pattern can use a combination of content analysis techniques—regular expressions, and proximity keywords—to identify the content and rate it with a low to high confidence score.image::add-data-profile-gif.GIF[scale=50]


|RQL Function—_IPAddress.areAllInCIDRRange()
+++<draft-comment>RLP-30642</draft-comment>+++
|RQL introduces a new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/operators.html#idf1090750-00ce-4a0e-adb1-609033551ce5[function] userinput:[_IPAddress.areAllInCIDRRange()] that confirms whether *all* the IP addresses assigned to a resource are within a specified CIDR block. It provides a yes or no answer to your question, “Do my databases have all IP addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 IP address range?“.This differs slightly from the existing _IPAddress.inCIDRRange() function, which returns true if at least one of the given IP addresses fall within the specified CIDR range.

The function takes two arguments userinput:[_IPAddress.areAllInCIDRRange(Resource,CIDR)]. The first argument allows you to specify the metadata within the resource configuration where you want to look that contains the IP address(es) and the second argument is a CIDR block to match. For example:returns a list of network interfaces that have private IP addresses that all fall entirely within the 172.31.67.71/24 CIDR block.

[userinput]
----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-network-interfaces' AND json.rule = _IPAddress.areAllInCIDRRange(privateIpAddresses[*].privateIpAddress,172.31.67.71/24) is true
----

|Permission Group Enhancement for Access to Prisma Cloud Compute Only
|When assigning administrative permissions on Prisma Cloud, you can now grant granular access for Prisma Cloud Compute capabilities only, and restrict access to the rest of the Prisma Cloud administrator console.

For the Account and Cloud Provisioning Admin, Account Group Admin, and Account Group Read Only roles, you can enable the *Only for Compute capabilities* option to allow access to the *Compute* and menu:Settings[Access Keys] page on the Prisma Cloud administrator console.

|*GCP Kubernetes Engine cluster workload identity is disabled* Identifies GCP Kubernetes Engine clusters for which workload identity is disabled. Manual approaches for authenticating Kubernetes workloads violates the principle of least privilege on a multi-tenanted node when one pod needs to have access to a service, but every other pod on the node that uses the service account does not. Enabling Workload Identity manages the distribution and rotation of Service account keys for the workloads to use.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = (workloadIdentityConfig[*] does not exist and nodePools[?any(config.workloadMetadataConfig does not exist )] exists) or (workloadIdentityConfig[*] exists and (nodePools[?any(config.workloadMetadataConfig does not contain GKE_METADATA)] exists))

|Policy Updates—RQL and Metadata
|*AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) listener that allow connection requests over HTTP* Policy RQL has been updated with new nested RQL grammar to leverage the advantage of RQL optimization. The policy name and recommendation steps have been updated to make it generic to various ELBv2 types instead of ALB only.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-30621</draft-comment>+++

|*AWS Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) Application Load Balancer (ALB) with access log disabled* Policy name and recommendation steps have been updated to make it generic to various ELBv2 types instead of ALB only.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-30621</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS IAM policy allows full administrative privileges* The RQL is updated with new nested RQL grammar and is optimized to evaluate multiple entries of policy statements for more accuracy.Policy recommendation steps are also updated.

*Updated RQL—* The updated RQL is:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = 'document.Statement[?any(Action equals * and Resource equals * and Effect equals Allow)] exists and (policyArn exists and policyArn does not contain iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess)'
----

*Impact—* With this change, open alerts that are no longer identified as policy violations will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-30624</draft-comment>+++

+++<draft-comment>Updated from email convo with Pradeep Biradar with email subject: 21.1.2-release-notes-review.pdf</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP IAM primitive roles are in use* Identifies GCP IAM users with primitive roles. Primitive roles (owner/editor) existed prior to GCP IAM and provides broader access to resources making them prone to attacks. Predefined roles provide more granular controls and should therefore be used.

*Updated RQL—* The updated RQL is:

screen:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-projects-get-iam-user' AND json.rule = '(user does not contain appspot.gserviceaccount.com and user does not contain developer.gserviceaccount.com and user does not contain cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com and user does not contain system.gserviceaccount.com and user does not contain cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com) and (roles contains roles/editor or roles contains roles/owner)']

*Impact—* With this change, default service and Google managed service accounts will now be excluded from alerts.

|Description


|Support for CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v.1.2.0
|Prisma Cloud adds support for CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v.1.2.0, which includes policy checks for the following Azure services—Identity and Access Management, Security Center, Storage Accounts, Database Services, Logging and Monitoring, Networking, Virtual Machines, Other Security Considerations, and AppService.


|Expanded Scope for Anomaly Trusted List
|For a resource that is identified as the trigger or _violating resource_ in an Anomaly alert, you can now suppress alerts for all traffic where the IP address of the resource is involved as the source or the destination for the associated network flows.

With this enhancement, when you add an IP address to the *Anomalies Trusted List* and specify the anomaly policies for which to suppress alerts, Prisma Cloud will not generate alerts for any network flow where the IP address is identified as the source or destination host.

For example, anomaly policies that identify unusual activities which use an unusual port or protocol, previously allowed you to suppress alerts for the first targeted host (destination) only. The details for the first targeted host was displayed as the *Resource Name* associated with the Anomaly alert. If the same IP address was the client that originated the flow (or source host) and not the destination, the alert was not suppressed. With this enhancement, all alerts for the policy are suppressed regardless of whether the IP address (resource name identified in the Anomaly alert) is the client (source) or target (destination) host.

An anomaly alert for unusual port scan activity in the following example is suppressedimage::rlp-30772-alert.png[scale=40]

when you add the IP address—194.61.53.242—to the Anomaly Trusted List. Prisma Cloud will not generate any alerts where the IP address is either the source or destination IP address.image::rlp-30772-trusted-list.png[scale=40]

|Bitbucket Server Plugin for Scanning IaC Templates
|Try the new Bitbucket Server plugin to perform IaC scans on Bitbucket pull requests and check them against Prisma Cloud default policies, or the custom policies that you define; this allows you to mitigate security or compliance risks in your DevOps processes and provides visibility on the scan results on the menu:Inventory[DevOps].

The Bitbucket Server plugin performs a full repository scan for the branch that the pull request was made on, and if policy violations exceed the severity-based criteria that you defined, then the pull request will be blocked.


|AWS CodePipelines IaC Scan Plugin Update
|The AWS CodePipelines plugin is updated to support the IaC Scan v2 API, and it replaces custom actions with a simplified docker-based CodeBuild solution.

[NOTE]
====
Custom actions are no longer supported.

|New Policies
|*AWS Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) SSL negotiation policy configured with weak ciphers* Identifies Elastic Load Balancers v2 (ELBv2) which are configured for SSL negotiation with weak ciphers. As a best practice, use only the ciphers recommended in the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html#deletion-protection[AWS documentation].

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = listeners[?any(sslPolicy contains ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-0-2015-04)] exists

|
|*AWS IAM role/user with unused CloudTrail delete or full permission* Identifies IAM roles/users that have unused CloudTrail delete permission or CloudTrail full permissions. As a best practice grant the least privilege access to perform a task and limit unintended access to your critical CloudTrail infrastructure.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = 'document.Statement[?any(Action equals * and Resource equals * and Effect equals Allow)] exists and (policyArn exists and policyArn does not contain iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess)'
----

|
|*AWS S3 buckets with overly permissive to VPC endpoints policy* Identifies S3 buckets that have the bucket policy overly permissive to VPC endpoints. As a best practice, follow the principle of least privileges to ensure that the VPC endpoints have only the necessary permissions instead of full permission on S3 operations.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name='aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = 'policy.Statement[?any((Condition.StringNotEquals contains aws:sourceVpce and Effect equals Deny and (Action contains s3:* or Action[*] contains s3:*)) or (Condition.StringEquals contains aws:SourceVpce and Effect equals Allow and (Action contains s3:* or Action[*] contains s3:*)))] exists'

|
|*Azure App Services FTP deployment is all allowed* Identifies Azure app services which has FTP deployment setting as 'all allowed' because it increases risk of attackers gaining full control of the app or service. As a best practice, use FTPS if FTP deployment for workflow is essential, otherwise, disable the FTP deployment for Azure App Services.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = config.ftpsState equals AllAllowed
