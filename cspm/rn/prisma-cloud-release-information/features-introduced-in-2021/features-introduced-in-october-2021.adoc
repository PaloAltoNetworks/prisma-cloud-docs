|DESCRIPTION


|*Enhancements to Asset Inventory*
|The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-dashboards/asset-inventory[Asset Inventory] has been updated with a new look-and-feel and performance improvements for faster navigation. Additionally, you have a new filter for Service Name within *Assets by Classification* that you can use to visualize the top ten services you have adopted across the cloud accounts onboarded on Prisma Cloud.

[NOTE]
====
The roll out for the asset inventory enhancements is gradual, and it is phased for each Prisma Cloud region. You will see the changes described, when it becomes available on your tenant. If you want to see these changes on your tenant sooner, reach out to your Customer Success or account team for enabling it.

==== New Policies and Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|tt:[IAM Azure GA] — *4 New OOTB policies*

Here are the list of policies that have been added with the tt:[IAM Azure GA] release of the IAM Security Module:

*Azure entities with risky permissions*

Identifies Azure IAM permissions that are risky. As a best practice, Azure entities provisioned in your Azure subscription shouldn’t have a risky set of permissions to minimize security risks.

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and action.name in ('Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory/b2cDirectories/write','Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/write','Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/assign/action','Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/read','Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/write','Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/deploy/action','Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies/write','Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write','Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/privateEndpointConnections/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/privateEndpointConnectionProxies/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/resourceManagementPrivateLinks/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/privateLinkAssociations/write','Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write','Microsoft.Authorization/locks/write','Microsoft.Authorization/denyAssignments/write','Microsoft.Authorization/classicAdministrators/write')
----


*Azure IAM effective permissions are over-privileged (7 days)*

Identifies Azure IAM permissions that are over-privileged. As a best practice, grant the least privilege access—for example—granting only the permissions required to perform a task, instead of providing excess permissions.

screen:[config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and action.lastaccess.days > 7]

*Azure IAM effective permissions are over-privileged (90 days)*

Identifies Azure IAM permissions that are over privileged. As a best practice, grant the least privilege access like granting only the permissions required to perform a task, instead of providing excess permissions.

screen:[config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and action.lastaccess.days > 90]

*Azure effective permissions granting wildcard resource access*

Identifies Azure IAM role definitions that contain userinput:['{asterisk}'] at the scope level. As a best practice, Azure role definitions should not have userinput:['{asterisk}'] at the scope level to prevent wildcard access to your resources.

----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and dest.cloud.resource.name = '*'
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-50038</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS OpenSearch Fine-grained access control is disabled*

Identifies AWS OpenSearch instances that have fine-grained access control disabled. This could impact alerts generated for all AWS OpenSearch instances with this option off.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-es-describe-elasticsearch-domain' AND json.rule = advancedSecurityOptions.enabled is false and advancedSecurityOptions.internalUserDatabaseEnabled is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-46769</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—Metadata*
|*GCP Projects have OS Login disabled*

The policy recommendation has been updated to allow userinput:[enable-oslogin] configuration at the instance-level instead of at the project-level.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-44541</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL*
|*AWS RDS instance not in private subnet*

The policy description, recommendation, and RQL has been updated. The RQL for this OOB policy previously used the userinput:[contains] operator when comparing two arrays; it has now been updated to include the userinput:[intersects] operator.

*Current—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-route-tables' as Y; filter "($.Y.associations[*].subnetId exists and $.X.dbsubnetGroup.subnets[*].subnetIdentifier contains $.Y.associations[*].subnetId) and ($.Y.routes[*].gatewayId exists and $.Y.routes[?(@.destinationCidrBlock == '0.0.0.0/0')].gatewayId contains igw)"; show X;
----

*Updated to—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-route-tables' AND json.rule = associations[*].subnetId exists and routes[?any( state equals active and gatewayId starts with igw- and (destinationCidrBlock equals "0.0.0.0/0" or destinationIpv6CidrBlock equals "::/0"))] exists as Y; filter '$.X.dbsubnetGroup.subnets[*].subnetIdentifier intersects $.Y.associations[*].subnetId'; show X;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-47406</draft-comment>+++

*Impact—* This change does not impact existing alerts.


|
|*GCP Firewall Rules*

The RQLs for the following policies have been updated so that they do not generate alerts for firewall rules that are disabled:

*GCP Firewall rule allows all traffic on SSH port (22)*

*Current—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule= 'sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(22,22) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp)) )] exists'
----

*Updated to—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule= 'disabled is false and (sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] contains ::/0) and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(22,22) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp)))] exists'
----

*GCP Firewall rule allows all traffic on RDP port (3389)*

*Current—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule= 'sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(3389,3389) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp)))] exists'
----

*Updated to—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule= 'disabled is false and (sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] contains ::/0) and allowed[?any(ports contains _Port.inRange(3389,3389) or (ports does not exist and (IPProtocol contains tcp or IPProtocol contains udp)))] exists'
----

*GCP Firewall rules allow inbound traffic from anywhere with no target tags set*

Updated Policy Name—GCP Firewall rule allows inbound traffic from anywhere with no specific target set

*Current—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = 'direction equals "INGRESS" and allowed[*] exists and sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 and targetTags[*] does not exist and targetServiceAccounts[*] does not exist'
----

*Updated to—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = 'disabled is false and direction equals "INGRESS" and allowed[*] exists and (sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] contains ::/0) and targetTags[*] does not exist and targetServiceAccounts[*] does not exist'
----

*Default Firewall rule should not have any rules (except http and https)*

Updated Policy Name—GCP Default Firewall rule is overly permissive (except http and https)

*Current—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = ' ($.name equals default-allow-ssh or $.name equals default-allow-icmp or $.name equals default-allow-internal or $.name equals default-allow-rdp) and ($.deleted is false) and ($.sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0)'
----

*Updated to—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name= 'gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = 'disabled is false and (name equals default-allow-ssh or name equals default-allow-icmp or name equals default-allow-internal or name equals default-allow-rdp) and (deleted is false) and (sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or sourceRanges[*] contains ::/0)'
----

*Impact—* The number of alerts generated will be reduced.

=== New Policies and Policy Updates

See the xref:../look-ahead-planned-updates-prisma-cloud.adoc#ida01a4ab4-6a2c-429d-95be-86d8ac88a7b4[look ahead updates] for planned features and policy updates for 21.10.2.

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policy*
|*Azure Container Instance not configured with the managed identity*

Identifies Azure Container Instances (ACIs) that are not configured with managed identity, which is authenticated with Azure AD. It is recommended to configure managed identity on all your container instances.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-container-instances-container-group' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and (identity.type does not exist or (identity.type exists and identity.type equal ignore case None))
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-46765</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Container Instance environment variable with regular value type*

Identifies ACIs in which the environment variables are of regular value type instead of secure value. Using secure values for environment variables is safer and more flexible than including them in your container's image. As a best practice, secure the environment variable by specifying the varname:[secureValue] property instead of the regular varname:[value] for the variable's type.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-container-instances-container-group' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.containers[*].properties.environmentVariables[*] exists and properties.containers[*].properties.environmentVariables[*].value exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-46763</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Container Instance is not configured with virtual network*

Identifies ACIs that are not configured with a virtual network. By deploying container instances into an Azure virtual network, your containers can communicate securely with other resources in the virtual network. As a best practice, configure all your container instances within a virtual network.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-container-instances-container-group' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.ipAddress.type exists and properties.ipAddress.type equals Public
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-46760</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Cosmos DB allows traffic from public Azure datacenters*

Identifies Cosmos DBs that allow traffic from public Azure data centers. If you enable this option, the IP address 0.0.0.0 is added to the list of allowed IP addresses. It is recommended not to select the *Accept connections from within public Azure datacenters* option for your Cosmos DB.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cosmos-db' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and properties.ipRangeFilter is not empty and properties.ipRangeFilter contains 0.0.0.0
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-46171</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS EMR Block public access setting disabled*

Checks for AWS EMR that are configured with block public access setting. This could impact alerts being generated for all AWS EMR with public access setting disabled.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-emr-public-access-block' AND json.rule = blockPublicAccessConfiguration.blockPublicSecurityGroupRules is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45595</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS EMR cluster Master Security Group allows all traffic to port 8088*

Checks for AWS EMR cluster that are configured with Master Security Group that allows all traffic to port 8088. This could impact alerts being generated for all AWS EMR cluster which has public access for port 8088.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-emr-describe-cluster' AND json.rule = status.state does not contain TERMINATING as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-ec2-describe-security-groups' AND json.rule = isShared is false and (ipPermissions[?any((ipRanges[] contains 0.0.0.0/0 or ipv6Ranges[].cidrIpv6 contains ::/0) and ((toPort == 8088 or fromPort == 8088) or (toPort > 8088 and fromPort < 8088)))] exists) as Y; filter '$.X.ec2InstanceAttributes.emrManagedMasterSecurityGroup equals $.Y.groupId or $.X.ec2InstanceAttributes.additionalMasterSecurityGroups[*] contains $.Y.groupId'; show X;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-45589</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS ECS fargate task definition logging is disabled*

Identifies ECS fargate task definitions for which logging is disabled. You can configure the containers in your tasks to send log information to CloudWatch logs to help you get information from running containers and services. If you are using the Fargate launch type for your tasks, this allows you to view the logs from your containers.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ecs-describe-task-definition' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and containerDefinitions[?any(logConfiguration.logDriver does not exist or logConfiguration.logDriver contains false)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-5459</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—Metadata*
|*Memcached default UDP port is publicly accessible*

The policy RQL has been updated to check network flows with bytes greater than zero. The policy name and description have also been updated.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
network from vpc.flow_record where protocol IN ( 'UDP' ) and dest.port = 11211 and bytes > 0 AND source.publicnetwork IN ( 'Internet IPs' , 'Suspicious IPs' , 'AWS IPs', 'Azure IPs', 'GCP IPs' )
