|DESCRIPTION


|*External ID Enhancement for Amazon SQS Integration*
|When you add a new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-amazon-sqs[Amazon SQS integration] on Prisma Cloud, the External ID associated with the IAM role must be a UUID in a 128-bit format, and not any random string.

For your convenience, the UUID is automatically generated on the Prisma Cloud web console. You must manually create one if you’re using the Prisma Cloud API.

Any existing integrations will continue to work. If you modify an existing Amazon SQS integration, you must replace the external ID to complete the validation check and save your changes.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*GCP Folders Hierarchy Mapping to Prisma Cloud Account Groups*
|To enable you to maintain the segregation of resources or business units based on your GCP resource heirarchy, you can now choose to automatically create account groups to match the folder structure when you https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-gcp-account/add-your-gcp-organization-to-prisma-cloud.html[onboard a GCP Organization] on Prisma Cloud.

You can choose how one of two options to automatically map projects to account groups:

*Auto Map* to automatically create an account group with the same name as the top-level folder that contains the project. This allows you to map a project to an account group with the same name as the top-level folder.

*Recurse Hierarchy* to create an account group for each folder within your GCP folder structure. This allows you to map each folder to an account group of the same name, even if the folder does not include projects, at the time you add the GCP account to Prisma Cloud.

All automatically created account groups are labeled as *auto-created* by the Prisma Cloud System Admin, and you cannot modify these account groups.

|*Richer Visualization to Summarize Prisma Cloud Policy Usage*
|To help you assess your coverage and utilization of policies that help you monitor and manage the security and compliance posture of your cloud resources and protect against potential risks or misconfigurations, Prisma Cloud has created new visualizations on the *Polices* page.Use the graphs to learn how many policies are enabled as a number or as a percentage of the total, review the split across different policy types, how many policies of high or medium severity are identified in your infrastructure, and gain greater context on the policy category and Prisma Cloud versus custom policies that are generating alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-26903</draft-comment>+++

image::policy-visualization.gif[scale=40]


|*Time Range Type Filter for Alerts*
|To help you easily find alerts that were either opened or the status was updated within a given time range, on the *Alerts* page the following new filters are now available:

image::alert-time-range-filter.png[scale=40]

Alert Opened - Filter on alerts based on when they were opened.

Alert Status Updated - Filter on alerts based on when the alert status last changed from one state to another.

Alert Updated - Filter on alerts based on when a resource update was observed but the alert status was not changed.

[NOTE]
====
Prisma Cloud is rolling out a new alert subsystem. On all environments that have been upgraded, you can see the new Time Range Type filter. If you do not see it on your tenant, it will be available to you soon.
====


|*API Ingestion*
|*azure-container-registry*

A new repositories field will be ingested for the existing *azure-container-registry* API resources that contain repositories. This is an update to ingest additional information to the existing *azure-container-registry* API.

Additional permissions not required.

The existing *Reader* role includes the permissions.

==== New Policies and Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY NAME
|DESCRIPTION


.4+|*New Policies*
|*AWS SNS topic policy overly permissive for publishing* Identifies AWS SNS topics that have SNS policy overly permissive for publishing. When a message is published, Amazon SNS attempts to deliver the message to the subscribed endpoints. To protect these messages from attackers and unauthorized usage, permissions should be given only to authorized users.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sns-get-topic-attributes' AND json.rule = Policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and (Action contains SNS:Publish or Action contains sns:Publish) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-3009</draft-comment>+++


|*AWS SNS topic policy overly permissive for subscription* Identifies AWS SNS topics that have SNS policy overly permissive for the subscription. When you subscribe an endpoint to a topic, the endpoint begins to receive messages published to the associated topic. To protect these messages from attackers and unauthorized usage, permissions should be given only to authorized users.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sns-get-topic-attributes' AND json.rule = Policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and (Action contains SNS:Subscribe or Action contains sns:Subscribe or Action contains SNS:Receive or Action contains sns:Receive) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-3014</draft-comment>+++


|*Azure Key Vault Firewall is not enabled* Identifies Azure Key Vaults which have the Firewall disabled. Enabling the Azure Key Vault Firewall feature prevents unauthorized traffic from reaching your key vault. It is a best practice to enable the Azure Key Vault Firewall which provides an additional layer of protection for your secrets.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-key-vault-list' AND json.rule = properties.networkAcls.ipRules[*].value does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34140</draft-comment>+++


|*Azure Key Vault Purge protection is not enabled* Identifies checks for Azure Key Vault which have the Purge protection disabled. This could impact alerts being generated for all Azure Key Vaults which have not enabled the Purge protection settings.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-key-vault-list' AND json.rule = properties.enablePurgeProtection is false
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34141</draft-comment>+++


|*IAM Security*
|The following new policies have been added for IAM Security on Prisma Cloud:

* AWS IAM effective permissions are over-privileged (7 days)

* AWS IAM effective permissions are over-privileged (90 days)

* AWS cross-account resource access through IAM policies

* AWS effective permissions granting wildcard resource access

* AWS entities with risky permissions

* AWS resources that are publicly accessible through IAM policies

* Okta user with effective permissions to create AWS IAM users

+++<draft-comment>copied this from look ahead updates for 21.3.2</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Updates—RQL and Metadata*
|*AWS IAM policy allows assume role permission across all services* The Policy RQL has been updated to exclude the Deny policy statements from the policy reportings.

*Updated RQL—* The updated RQL is:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = document.Statement[?any( Effect equals Allow and Action contains sts:AssumeRole and Resource equals * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----


*Impact—* Alerts raised for Deny policy statements are resolved as 'Policy_Updated'.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34774</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Application Gateway does not have the Web application firewall (WAF) enabled*The RQL was not considering when the Azure Application Gateway resources were attached with the WAF policy through WAF service and was therefore creating false positives. The RQL policy has been updated to resolve the FPs.

*Updated RQL—* The updated RQL is:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-application-gateway' AND json.rule = (['properties.webApplicationFirewallConfiguration'] does not exist and ['properties.firewallPolicy'] does not exist) or (['properties.webApplicationFirewallConfiguration'].enabled is false and ['properties.firewallPolicy'] does not exist)
----


*Impact—* Alerts raised for Application Gateway which has the WAF policy enabled through WAF service will be resolved with reason as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34925</draft-comment>+++


.2+|*Policy Updates— Remediation*
|*Azure Security Center web application firewall monitoring is set to disabled* The policy has been removed because the setting to Disable / Audit has been deprecated by Azure in the Security Center recommendations.

*Impact—* All alerts generated for this policy will be resolved with reason Policy_Delected.

*Threat Detection on SQL databases is set to Off* The policy recommendation has been updated to reflect the UI changes made on Azure.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34924</draft-comment>+++


|The following GCP policies have been updated to match the recommendation steps of the policies with the GCP web interface.

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC network route changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for Project Ownership assignments/changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for IAM custom role changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for Audit Configuration Changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC Network Firewall rule changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC network changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes*

* *GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for SQL instance configuration changes*

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34767</draft-comment>+++


|*Policy Update for Improved Accuracy*
|To ensure better accuracy with alerts the following out-of-box policies have a RQL change to address a Config RQL query issue when the filter part of a join contains a negation (the `not ()` surrounding the filter clause) AND at least one of the variables (varname:[X], varname:[Y,] or varname:[Z]) is empty at evaluation:

* *AWS VPC has flow logs disabled*

* *AWS VPC not in use*

* *OCI Block Storage Block is not restorable*

For example, if varname:[X] is defined as: screen:[`config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-describe-vpcs' as X`] You will always get no results if you currently have no VPCs in your cloud account, even if varname:[Y] and/or varname:[Z] were non-empty.

*Impact—* With this update, you may have new alerts generated against the policies listed above. Additionally, if you have used such a negated filter clause in a custom policy with an API that is likely to be empty sometimes, Prisma Cloud may generate alerts that were not triggered for the same policy previously.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35423.</draft-comment>+++

+++<draft-comment>@Matangi: Copied from look ahead and made some edits. This seems like a RQL update but the formatting is different from what we usually do. Since it was published with the look ahead updates for 21.3.2 I assume it's ok.</draft-comment>+++
