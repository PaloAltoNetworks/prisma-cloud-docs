|DESCRIPTION


|*Alarm Center*
|Prisma Cloud generates health notifications called *Alarms* that display system-level issues and errors that have occurred in Integrations status and Cloud Accounts status.

You can https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/define-prisma-cloud-enterprise-settings.html[enable Alarms] on the menu:Settings[Enterprise Settings] page.

The *Alarm Center* displays the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alarms.html[alarms], which you can review and take necessary action to rectify the error or issue.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS Elastic IP not in use—* Identifies unused Elastic IP (EIP) addresses in your AWS account.

Any EIP in your AWS account adds charges to your monthly bill even if it is not associated with any resources. It is recommended to remove EIPs that are not associated with any resources.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ec2-elastic-address' AND json.rule = associationId does not exist
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-34778</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS SNS topic not configured with secure data transport policy—* Identifies AWS SNS topics that are not configured with a secure data transport policy.

AWS SNS topics should enforce encryption of data in transit using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It is recommended to add an SNS policy that explicitly denies publish access from anybody who browses to Amazon SNS topics if they are not accessed through HTTPS.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sns-get-topic-attributes' AND json.rule = Policy.Statement[?any((Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Condition.Bool.aws:SecureTransport does not exist and Action contains Publish)] exists or Policy.Statement[?any((Effect equals Allow and Action contains Publish and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and (Condition.Bool.aws:SecureTransport contains false or Condition.Bool.aws:SecureTransport contains FALSE)) or (Effect equals Deny and Action contains Publish and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and (Condition.Bool.aws:SecureTransport contains true or Condition.Bool.aws:SecureTransport contains TRUE)))] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-32948</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS SNS topic with cross-account access—* Identifies AWS SNS topics that are configured with cross-account access.

Allowing unknown cross-account access to your SNS topics will enable other accounts to gain control over your AWS SNS topics. To prevent unknown cross-account access, allow only trusted entities to access your Amazon SNS topics by implementing the appropriate SNS policies.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sns-get-topic-attributes' AND json.rule = Policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS does not equal * and Principal does not equal * and Principal.AWS contains arn))] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-3011</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Storage account containing VHD OS disk is not encrypted with CMK—* Checks for Azure Storage accounts containing VHD OS disk that are not encrypted with CMK.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Anomaly Settings Updates*
|When you modify the alert disposition or training model thresholds for Anomaly policies, an audit log is generated to record who made the configuration change and when, to help you track and monitor changes.

For User & Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) policies, when you modify the alert disposition or training model thresholds, the updated settings are applicable for new alerts. Existing alerts generated using the previous setting remain as-is, and are not marked as *Resolved*.

With this change, UEBA and Network Anomaly policies are consistent in how anomaly settings changes are processed on Prisma Cloud.

|*Integration with Azure Sentinel*
|You can now forward Prisma Cloud alerts to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-azure-sentinel.html[Azure Sentinel] using HTTP-triggered Logic App workflow and Webhook integration.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36818</draft-comment>+++


|*Centralized Scan Settings for Data Security*
|To help you gauge the volume of data in an S3 bucket and how you have opted to enable scanning, use the updated menu:Settings[Data > Scan Settings]  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/monitor-data-security-scan-prisma-cloud/data-security-settings.html[page].

The page enables you to select the S3 buckets for the onboarded cloud accounts and modify the scan settings to perform Forward & Backward or Forward-scan only. When enabling the scan, you can also review an estimate of the Prisma Cloud credits that will be used for the selected S3 buckets.

[NOTE]
====
You must use the updated AWS CFT to onboard a cloud account to view bucket size estimates. For already onboarded cloud accounts, the bucket size estimation will not be available.
====

The new table view displays an estimate of the total data in the S3 bucket, and the volume of data eligible for sensitive data scanning, malware scanning, or both based on the supported file types and file size.

image::dlp-scan-settings.png[scale=30]


|*Alerts 2.0*


+++<draft-comment>RLP-37023</draft-comment>+++
|Prisma Cloud is rolling out a new alert subsystem. To help you identify if you are on version 2.0, on the menu:Alerts[Overview] page, check whether the
*Version: 2* label displays on the top right above the *Search* box. With version 2.0, the following changes will take effect:

* Depending on volume of alerts, the time to update the status of an alert can vary when you update an alert rule. For example, if you remove a policy from an alert rule, all open alerts will transition to a resolved state and the time to reflect this change on the interface can depend on the number of corresponding alerts.

* When you modify an alert rule, and the conditions that triggered the alert are no longer valid, the alert is updated as *Resolved*.

* (tt:[New]) The *Active Alert Rules* name associated with an alert displays as *N/A* in the alert details view. This N/A state means that the match criteria changed because of the following reasons:
+
image::alerts-2.0-notification-n-a.png[scale=40]
+
** The alert rule that triggered the alert is disabled or deleted.

** The cloud account is no longer included in the alert rule that triggered the alert.

** The policy that triggered the alert is removed from the alert rule.

* For alert rules with scheduled notifications, the notification is sent when an alert status changes from one state to anotheras tracked in the *Alert Status Updated* timestamp.
+
image::alerts-2.0-notification.png[scale=30]
+
[NOTE]
====
This change will not impact those who have configured notifications for *Open* alerts only.
====


|tt:[Update] *OCI IAM*
|The *oci-iam-user* API have been modified to ingest the *ListCustomerSecretKeys* and *ListAuthTokens* REST APIs.

These additional APIs are ingested using the permissions in the USER_READ role.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36642</draft-comment>+++


|tt:[Update] *Permission in the AWS CFT*
|The AWS CFTs that enable you add cloud accounts to Prisma Cloud now includes additional permissions to support the Inventory Configuration for S3 buckets. This inventory list file contains the objects and metadata for the objects in the S3 bucket.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*New Policies*
|*AWS ECS cluster not configured with active services* Identifies ECS clusters that are not configured with active services. ECS service enables you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster. It is recommended to remove Idle ECS clusters to reduce the container attack surface or create new services for the reported ECS cluster.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ecs-cluster' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and activeServicesCount equals 0
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35951</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS ECS cluster not configured with a registered instance* Identifies ECS clusters that are not configured with a registered instance. The ECS container instance is an Amazon EC2 instance that is running the Amazon ECS container agent, and has been registered into an Amazon ECS cluster. It is recommended to remove idle ECS clusters to reduce the container attack surface or to register a new instance for the reported ECS cluster.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ecs-service' AND json.rule = launchType equals EC2 as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ecs-cluster' AND json.rule = status equals ACTIVE and registeredContainerInstancesCount equals 0 as Y; filter '$.X.clusterArn equals $.Y.clusterArn'; show Y;
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35952</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS Amazon Machine Image (AMI) infected with mining malware* Identifies Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are infected with mining malware. Research showed that an AMI Windows 2008 was hosted by an unverified vendor and contained malicious code running an unidentified crypto miner (Monero). It is recommended to delete such AMIs to protect from malicious activity and attacks.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name='aws-ec2-describe-images' AND json.rule = image.platform contains windows and image.imageId contains ami-1e542176
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-29943</draft-comment>+++


|
|*AWS SNS topic is exposed to unauthorized access* Identifies AWS SNS topics that are exposed to unauthorized access. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients. To protect these messages from attackers and unauthorized access, permissions should be given to only authorized users.

----
 config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-sns-get-topic-attributes' AND json.rule = Policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-3015</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Security Center Defender set to Off for Container Registries* Checks Azure Security Center and determines if the Defender setting for Container Registries is set to *Off*. This could impact alerts being generated for all Azure Security Center where the Defender setting is Off for Container Registries. This policy is mapped to CIS Azure 1.3.0 section 2.7 compliance standard.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = pricings[?any( name equals ContainerRegistry and properties.pricingTier does not equal Standard)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35268</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Security Center Defender set to Off for SQL servers on machines* Checks Azure Security Center and determines if the Defender setting for SQL servers on machines is set to *Off*. This could impact alerts being generated for all Azure Security Center where the Defender setting on machines is set to *Off* for SQL servers. This policy is mapped to CIS Azure 1.3.0 section 2.4 compliance standard.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = pricings[?any( name equals SqlServerVirtualMachines and properties.pricingTier does not equal Standard)] exists
----

+++<draft-comment>RLP-35267</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Anomalous Compute Provisioning Activity* The new Anomaly policy detects unusual activity related to the provisioning of compute resources such as high number of instances being brought up, the provisioning activity originating from TOR nodes or from multiple distant locations in a short duration of time. This behavior typically indicates the creation of an unauthorized network of compute instances for cryptojacking.


|*Policy Updates*
|*AWS IAM policy allows assume role permission across all services* The RQL is updated to exclude unattached policies from reporting and is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-policy-version' AND json.rule = isAttached is true and document.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action contains sts:AssumeRole and Resource equals * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----


*Impact—* Existing alerts generated for unattached policies will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36286</draft-comment>+++


|
|*Azure Load Balancer diagnostics logs are disabled* The policy recommendation has been updated because the steps for Azure Load Balancer with Basic SKU was missing.

*Impact—* No impact on existing alerts.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36361</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP Projects have OS Login Disabled* The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-project-info' AND json.rule = 'commonInstanceMetadata.items[*].key does not contain enable-oslogin or (commonInstanceMetadata.items[?any(key contains enable-oslogin and (value contains false or value contains FALSE))] exists)'
----


*Impact—* This updates the accuracy of alerts and reduces the number of alerts that are generated.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-36687</draft-comment>+++


|
|*GCP Firewall rules allow inbound traffic from anywhere with no target tags set* The policy RQL is modified to escape *Deny* rules because the policy was giving false positives due to the policy RQL not being set to check if the GCP is an *Allow* or a *Deny* rule.

The policy RQL is modified as follows:

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name='gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list' AND json.rule = 'direction equals "INGRESS" and allowed[*] exists and sourceRanges[*] contains 0.0.0.0/0 and targetTags[*] does not exist and targetServiceAccounts[*] does not exist' 
----


*Impact—* The update is going to resolve false positive alerts and therefore reduce the number of alerts being generated.
