[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts*
//RLP-60053

|New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts are expected to be available in the February 2023 release. The existing Prisma Cloud AWS onboarding APIs will be available for 90 days after the new APIs are released.

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433
|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Configure Flow Logs] with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required.


|tt:[Enhancement] *Role Assignment Modification for SSO Sign-In*
//RLP-79486

|If you have enabled access to users on Prisma Cloud using SSO with JIT provisioning, you can no longer modify their roles in the Prisma Cloud administrative console, unless they have previously been added to an SSO bypass list. Starting with release 23.2.2, role management for these users needs to be completed from the Identity Provider (IDP) for the change to take effect.
 
[NOTE]
====
 Users on the SSO bypass list can modify their roles and login directly to the Prisma Cloud console via credentials. However, once you opt to sign-in via SSO, your role will get reset to the IDP provisioned role.
====


|*Google Compute SSL Policies Update*
//RLP-88378

|Beginning with the 23.3.1 release, there will be a JSON update to increase the visibility and monitoring of *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* API resources. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console. 

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against the policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice an increased count for the number of alerts for the following OOTB policies:

* GCP HTTPS Load balancer SSL Policy not using restrictive profile
* GCP Load Balancer HTTPS proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP Load Balancer SSL proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP HTTPS Load balancer is configured with SSL policy having TLS version 1.1 or lower

However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* start ingesting data again.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.2.2

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Activity Log Retention should not be set to less than 365 days*
//RLP-87612

|*Changes—* The policy name, description,and recommendations are updated according to the latest vendor UI settings.The policy RQL is updated to exclude resource groups to report only subscriptions.

*Current Name—* Activity Log Retention should not be set to less than 365 days
*Updated Name—* Azure Activity Log retention should not be set to less than 365 days

*Updated Description—* Identifies Log profiles which have log retention set to less than 365 days. Log profile controls how your Activity Log is exported and retained. Since the average time to detect a breach is over 200 days, it is recommended to retain your activity log for 365 days or more in order to have time to respond to any incidents.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND cloud.service = 'Azure Monitor' AND api.name = 'azure-monitor-log-profiles-list' AND json.rule = 'isLegacy is true and (properties.retentionPolicy !exists or (properties.retentionPolicy.days != 0 and properties.retentionPolicy.days < 365))'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-monitor-log-profiles-list' AND json.rule = isLegacy is true and (properties.retentionPolicy does not exist or properties.retentionPolicy.enabled is false or (properties.retentionPolicy.enabled is true and (properties.retentionPolicy.days does not equal 0 and properties.retentionPolicy.days < 365)))
----

*Impact—* Low. New alerts will be generated for disabled log profiles.


2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

|*GCP VPC Network subnets have Private Google access disabled*
//RLP-90438

|*Changes—* The policy remediation CLI command description to define granular permissions required for running the remediation CLI command is updated.

*Updated Remediation CLI Description—* This CLI command requires 'compute.subnetworks.setPrivateIpGoogleAccess', 'compute.subnetworks.setPrivateIpGoogleAccess' and 'compute.subnetworks.update' permissions. Successful execution will enable GCP VPC Network subnets 'Private Google access'.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*GCP Storage buckets are publicly accessible to all authenticated users*
//RLP-90437

|*Changes—* The policy remediation CLI command description to define granular permissions required for running the remediation CLI command is updated.

*Updated Remediation CLI Description—* This CLI command requires 'storage.buckets.getIamPolicy’ and 'storage.buckets.setIamPolicy' permissions. Successful execution will revoke 'allAuthenticatedUsers' permission access in GCP Storage buckets.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*GCP Storage log buckets have object versioning disabled*
//RLP-90436

|*Changes—* The policy remediation CLI command description to define granular permissions required for running the remediation CLI command is updated.
