|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Code Security has a New Name*
//RLP-106732
|Starting with 23.8.2, Cloud Application Security is the new name for the combination of the Cloud Code Security capabilities and the newly introduced CI/CD Security module. CI/CD Security is available as a standard a-la-carte option or as an add-on with the Prisma Cloud Runtime Security Foundations or Advanced bundles.

Owing to the name change, the path to Projects, Development Pipelines and Supply Chain will now be Application Security instead of Code Security on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The change does not impact any existing workflows for scanning and fixing issues.


|*New Policies for Cloud Code Security*
//RLP-107182
|Starting with the 23.8.2 release, 125 new Config policies of subtype Build that enable the detection of CI/CD security risks  will be enabled by default and available on the *Policies* page. With the release, the Code Security capabilties are being renamed as Application Security, and also will introduce CI/CD Security.

These new policies will not generate any alerts until you enable  the new *CI/CD Security* capability on "Settings > Application Security Configuration". When you subscribe the CI/CD Security capability, when it becomes available, the alerts will display on "Application Security > CI/CD Risks".

=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents rrent Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.8.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS CloudTrail is not enabled with multi trail and not capturing all management events*
//RLP-108006
|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to check if logging all management events has been enabled via basic or advanced event selectors.

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-describe-trails' AND json.rule = 'isMultiRegionTrail is true and includeGlobalServiceEvents is true' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-get-trail-status' AND json.rule = 'status.isLogging equals true' as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-get-event-selectors' AND json.rule = 'eventSelectors[*].readWriteType contains All' as Z; filter '($.X.trailARN equals $.Z.trailARN) and ($.X.name equals $.Y.trail)'; show X; count(X) less than 1
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-describe-trails' AND json.rule = 'isMultiRegionTrail is true and includeGlobalServiceEvents is true' as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-get-trail-status' AND json.rule = 'status.isLogging equals true' as Y; config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-cloudtrail-get-event-selectors' AND json.rule = '(eventSelectors[].readWriteType contains All and eventSelectors[].includeManagementEvents equal ignore case true) or (advancedEventSelectors[].fieldSelectors[].equals contains "Management" and advancedEventSelectors[].fieldSelectors[].field does not contain "readOnly" and advancedEventSelectors[].fieldSelectors[].field does not contain "eventSource")' as Z; filter '($.X.trailARN equals $.Z.trailARN) and ($.X.name equals $.Y.trail)'; show X; count(X) less than 1
----

*Impact—* Medium. Alerts will be generated when the logging of all management events are not enabled by default through advanced selectors. Existing alerts where the logging of all management events was enabled via advanced selectors will be resolved.


|*GCP VM instances have block project-wide SSH keys feature disabled*
//	RLP-102346	

|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to check for enabling OS login for the GCP VM instances.

*Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-project-info' AND json.rule = commonInstanceMetadata.kind equals "compute#metadata" and commonInstanceMetadata.items[?any(key contains "block-project-ssh-keys" and (value contains "Yes" or value contains "Y" or value contains "True" or value contains "true" or value contains "TRUE" or value contains "1"))] does not exist as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and (metadata.items[?any(key exists and key contains "block-project-ssh-keys" and (value contains "Yes" or value contains "Y" or value contains "True" or value contains "true" or value contains "TRUE" or value contains "1"))] does not exist and name does not start with "gke-") as Y; filter '$.Y.zone contains $.X.name'; show Y;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-project-info' AND json.rule = commonInstanceMetadata.kind equals "compute#metadata" and commonInstanceMetadata.items[?any(key contains "enable-oslogin" and (value contains "Yes" or value contains "Y" or value contains "True" or value contains "true" or value contains "TRUE" or value contains "1"))] does not exist and commonInstanceMetadata.items[?any(key contains "ssh-keys")] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and ( metadata.items[?any(key exists and key contains "block-project-ssh-keys" and (value contains "Yes" or value contains "Y" or value contains "True" or value contains "true" or value contains "TRUE" or value contains "1"))] does not exist and metadata.items[?any(key exists and key contains "enable-oslogin" and (value contains "Yes" or value contains "Y" or value contains "True" or value contains "true" or value contains "TRUE" or value contains "1"))] does not exist and name does not start with "gke-") as Y; filter '$.Y.zone contains $.X.name'; show Y;
----

*Impact—* Low. Alerts will be generated where the enable OS-login is not enabled for the GCP VM instances. Existing alerts where the block-project-ssh-keys are disabled at the project level will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.

2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*Updates to Azure Policy Names*
//RLP-101285
|*Changes—* The policy names will be updated for the following policies:

*Current Policy Name—* Azure storage account logging for tables is disabled
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure storage account logging (Classic Diagnostic Setting) for tables is disabled

*Current Policy Name—* Azure storage account logging for blobs is disabled
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure storage account logging (Classic Diagnostic Setting) for blobs is disabled

*Current Policy Name—* Azure storage account logging for queues is disabled
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure storage account logging (Classic Diagnostic Setting) for queues is disabled

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Impact—* No impact since only the policy names will be updated.
