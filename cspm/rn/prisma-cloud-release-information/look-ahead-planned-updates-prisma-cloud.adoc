|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts*
//RLP-60053

|New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts are expected to be available in the February 2023 release. The existing Prisma Cloud AWS onboarding APIs will be available for 90 days after the new APIs are released.

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433
|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Configure Flow Logs] with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required.


|*Google BigQuery API Resource ID Update*
//RLP-80884

|Beginning with the 23.1.1 release, the resource ID for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* in Prisma Cloud will be updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API will be deleted once and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts for this API resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

|*Enabling GCP APIs at Source Project*
//RLP-86121

|Beginning with the 23.1.1 release, you must enable the following GCP APIs for each project that the service account accesses to allow monitoring and protection using Prisma Cloud:

* screen:[bigtableadmin.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[container.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[logging.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[monitoring.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[pubsub.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[serviceusage.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[firebaserules.googleapis.com]

*Impact*—No impact on alerts.

=== New Policies and Policy Updates

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.


[.task]
[#id1df88b7e-2f8b-4c9e-a737-fa22271cbb36]
==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:

[.procedure]
. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.1.1

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.


[#policy-updates]
==== Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Azure AD Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is enabled*
//RLP-84177

|*Changes—* The policy RQL and recommendation steps have been updated according to the CSP changes. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = permissionGrantPolicyIdsAssignedToDefaultUserRole[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = defaultUserRolePermissions.permissionGrantPoliciesAssigned[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Impact—* Low. Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

|*SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured*
//RLP-84336

|*Changes—* The policy Name, Description, and Recommendation steps have been updated to maintain consistency across policies. The RQL has been updated with a new RQL grammar that will improve the accuracy of the results.

*Current Policy Name—* SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure SQL server not configured with Active Directory admin authentication

*Updated Policy Description—*

Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, you can centrally manage the identities of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location. As a best practice, configure SQL servers with Active Directory admin authentication. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '$.serverAdmins !exists or $.serverAdmins[] size equals 0 or ($.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType exists and $.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and $.serverAdmins[].properties.login is not empty)'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = serverAdmins does not exist or serverAdmins[*] size equals 0 or (serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType exists and serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and serverAdmins[*].properties.login is not empty)
----

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-85282

|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to ignore the case sensitive of the parameter value.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name is not member of ("GatewaySubnet", "AzureFirewallSubnet") and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Impact—* Low. Previous generated alert for gateway subnets where the name is not as GatewaySubnet will be resolved as Policy_Updated.
