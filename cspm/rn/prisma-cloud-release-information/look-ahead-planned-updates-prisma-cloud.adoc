[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.6.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal*
//RLP-99453

|*Changes—* The Policy RQL will be updated to consider *Block Public Access* settings configuration at account and bucket Level.

*Severity—* Medium. 

*Impact—* Medium. Based on the Block Public Access settings at account and bucket Level, some alerts might get resolved.


|*AWS S3 bucket publicly writable*
//RLP-99357

|*Changes—* The Policy RQL will be updated to also check for *Authenticated Users* access.

*Severity—* High. 

*Impact—* Low. New alerts may be generated if Authenticated Users have _Write_ permissions.

//RLP-102099

|*Changes—* The Policy RQL will be updated to verify if _resource type_ is present in the Log metric filter.

*Severity—* Informational. 

*Current RQL—*
