[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433
|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Configure Flow Logs] with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required.



|tt:[Enhancement] *Role Assignment Modification for SSO Sign-In*
//RLP-79486

|If you have enabled access to users on Prisma Cloud using SSO with JIT provisioning, you can no longer modify their roles in the Prisma Cloud administrative console, unless they have previously been added to an SSO bypass list. Starting with release 23.2.2, role management for these users needs to be completed from the Identity Provider (IDP) for the change to take effect.
 
[NOTE]
====
 Users on the SSO bypass list can modify their roles and login directly to the Prisma Cloud console via credentials. However, once you opt to sign-in via SSO, your role will get reset to the IDP provisioned role.
====


|*Google Compute SSL Policies Update*
//RLP-88378

|Beginning with the 23.3.1 release, there will be a JSON update to increase the visibility and monitoring of *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* API resources. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console. 

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against the policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice an increased count for the number of alerts for the following OOTB policies:

* GCP HTTPS Load balancer SSL Policy not using restrictive profile
* GCP Load Balancer HTTPS proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP Load Balancer SSL proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP HTTPS Load balancer is configured with SSL policy having TLS version 1.1 or lower

However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* start ingesting data again.


|*Google Cloud Task Update*
//RLP-89522

|Beginning with the 23.2.2 release, Prisma Cloud will no longer ingest *gcloud-cloud-task* API related resources as these are ephemeral. As a result, all *gcloud-cloud-task* resources will be deleted from your tenant.

Impact—No impact on alerts.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.2.2

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

==== Policy Updates

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*AWS EC2 instance that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port*
//RLP-90651

|*Changes—* The policy name and description are updated.The policy RQL is updated to report instances configured with HTTP (80) and HTTP (443) ports, which are in active state only.

*Current Name—* AWS EC2 instance that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port
*Updated Name—* AWS EC2 instance that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)

*Updated Description—* Identifies AWS EC2 instances that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). EC2 instances with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/0:79', 'tcp/81:442', 'tcp/444:65535' )
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.resource.state = 'Active'
----

*Impact—* Medium. Existing alerts will be resolved as *Policy_Updated* for instances that are no longer active. New alerts are generated when the instance is connected to the internet and configured with an HTTP / HTTPS port.


|*AWS Glue connection do not have SSL configured*
//RLP-87913
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to exclude AWS Glues with connection type as Network from reporting because they cannot be configured for SSL.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-glue-connection' AND json.rule = (connectionType equals KAFKA and connectionProperties.KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED is false) or (connectionType does not equal KAFKA and connectionProperties.JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL is false)
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-glue-connection' AND json.rule = ((connectionType equals KAFKA and connectionProperties.KAFKA_SSL_ENABLED is false) or (connectionType does not equal KAFKA and connectionProperties.JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL is false)) and connectionType does not equal "NETWORK"
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.


|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-90289
|*Changes—* The policy RQL is updated to exclude the private endpoint and private link associated subnets.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "RouteServerSubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes"
----

*Impact—* Medium. Existing alerts will be resolved as *Policy_Updated* for which private endpoint is in disabled state. New alerts are generated for private endpoints in disabled state with no network security group.



2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

|*GCP VPC Network subnets have Private Google access disabled*
//RLP-90438

|*Changes—* The policy remediation CLI command description to define granular permissions required for running the remediation CLI command is updated.

*Updated Remediation CLI Description—* This CLI command requires 'compute.subnetworks.setPrivateIpGoogleAccess', 'compute.subnetworks.setPrivateIpGoogleAccess' and 'compute.subnetworks.update' permissions. Successful execution will enable GCP VPC Network subnets 'Private Google access'.
