|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*API for generating External ID for AWS cloud account onboarding*

// tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 22.4.1 release.]

// RLP-60053 and RLP-64168. Verify and add blurb under REST API section.

// This blurb has been updated again in 22.6.3

// This blurb has been updated in 22.9.1

+++<draft-comment>This blurb was updated in 22.10.2 to Jan 2023 instead of dec 2023.</draft-comment>+++
|While onboarding AWS standalone, organization, or member accounts using the Prisma Cloud API, you cannot provide the External ID. Instead, Prisma Cloud generates a random External ID and includes it in the IAM Role CFT.

The External ID is valid for 30 days. If you do not complete the onboarding flow within this 30-day period, you must restart the onboarding workflow.

Prisma Cloud now supports the existing Add, Save and Update Cloud Account APIs for up to 90 days after the release, until the end of January 2023, to ensure that automation continues to work and you have adequate time to migrate automation to the new APIs.

Similarly, the CFTs in the S3 bucket will continue to be available until the end of March 2023 for backward compatibility.

This change does not impact already onboarded AWS accounts.

|*Alert Response Count Updates*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-81552</draft-comment>+++
|Beginning with the 22.12.1 release, the maximum number of alerts returned for the following Alerts APIs will be 10,000 if no *limit* parameter is specified in the request:

* https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cspm/alerts#operation/post-alerts-v2[POST - /v2/alert]
* https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cspm/alerts#operation/get-alerts-v2[GET - /v2/alert]
* https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cspm/alerts#operation/post-alerts[POST - /alert]
* https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cspm/alerts#operation/get-alerts[GET - /alert]

Use a v2 method, if you want to paginate with the *pageToken* parameter.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies and Policy Updates

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.


[.task]
[#id1df88b7e-2f8b-4c9e-a737-fa22271cbb36]
==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:

[.procedure]
. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-22.12.1

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Policy Updates-RQL*
|

|*Instances affected by Apache Log4j (CVE-2021-44228), OMIGOD (CVE-2021-38647), SpringShell (CVE-2022-22963/22965) vulnerability are exposed to network traffic from the internet*
//RLP-83964

|*Changes-* Policy RQL have been updated to enhance the scope of network traffic direction.

*Current RQL—*

----
network from vpc.flow_record where bytes > 0 AND source.resource IN ( resource where finding.type IN ( 'Host Vulnerability' ) AND finding.source IN ( 'Prisma Cloud' ) AND finding.name IN ('CVE-2021-44228') ) AND destination.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs')
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
network from vpc.flow_record where bytes > 0 AND dest.resource IN (resource where finding.type IN ('Host Vulnerability') AND finding.source IN ('Prisma Cloud') AND finding.name IN ('CVE-2021-44228')) AND source.publicnetwork IN ('Internet IPs', 'Suspicious IPs')
----

Update the CVE number above to see updated RQL for the corresponding vulnerability.

*Impact—* Low. New alerts will be created if any vulnerable resources (0 customer with <10k alerts 0 customer with <10% impact).

|*AWS Customer Master Key (CMK) rotation is not enabled*
//RLP-84011

|*Changes-* Updated policy RQL only to report custom keys generated via KMS which have automatic key rotation feature.
