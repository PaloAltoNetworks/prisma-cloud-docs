|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Simplified Onboarding of AWS, Azure, and GCP Cloud Accounts*
//RLP-96371

|Beginning with the 23.4.2 release, Prisma Cloud will provide a simplified onboarding experience to adapt to your security priorities in a streamlined manner with support for CSPM, CWPP, Data Security, and Identity Security grouped as Foundational and/or Advanced capabilities (with a few enabled by default). The updated onboarding workflow provides a Faster First Time to Value (FTTV) by allowing you to onboard your AWS, Azure, or GCP cloud accounts and selecting the security capabilities in fewer clicks.


|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433

|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by April 15, 2023.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Configure Flow Logs] with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required.

|*Update for Google Compute APIs*
//RLP-47280

|Beginning in the 23.4.2 release, Prisma Cloud will provide global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for *gcloud-compute-internal-lb-backend-service* API. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-internal-lb-backend-service* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

|tt:[Code Security] *CycloneDX XML Output Format Update*
//RLP- 97674, Codesec blurb, M will share the final blurb later
|In 23.4.2, the CycloneDX XML output format will be updated to match the Python library updates where all XML tags will be namespaced. This update helps with serialization and deserialization, but it may have some breaking impact with ingesting the SBOM documents.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.4.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.
