[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Changes to Network Anomaly Policies*
//RLP-92983, RLP-93119

|Beginning with the 23.3.1 release, Prisma Cloud will modify the names of the external network anomaly policies to make it easier to identify cloud resources involved in the alerts reported by these policies. Additonally, in the alert details, the *Resource Name* will now display the internal resource (cloud instance) targeted or generating traffic instead of the public *IP address* of the source host participating in the suspicious activity.

The *Port Sweep activity (External)* network anomaly policy involves multiple internal resources and selecting only one can create confusion. In order to avoid confusion, *Port Sweep activity (External)* policy that will continue to display the public *IP address* in the *Resource Name* after the change.

For more information, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/external-network-anomaly-policies-changes.pdf[list of policies] that are affected.

*Impact-* Only applies to any new alert generated by a network anomaly policy. No impact on existing alerts.


|*Google Compute SSL Policies Update*
//RLP-88378

|Beginning with the 23.3.1 release, there will be a JSON update to increase the visibility and monitoring of *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* API resources. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console. 

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against the policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice an increased count for the number of alerts for the following OOTB policies:

* GCP HTTPS Load balancer SSL Policy not using restrictive profile
* GCP Load Balancer HTTPS proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP Load Balancer SSL proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP HTTPS Load balancer is configured with SSL policy having TLS version 1.1 or lower

However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* start ingesting data again.


|*Changes to Policy Severity Level*

|Beginning with the 23.4.1 release, Prisma Cloud will make changes to our system default policies to help you identify the critical alerts and ensure that you can address them efficiently. The severity levels of the system default policies will be modified as part of the planned update. For more information, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/policy-severity-level-changes.pdf[list of policies] that are affected.

*Impact-* You may see:

* Changes in the severity of existing alerts
* Changes in your overall compliance status due to the modified severity of alerts
* Decrease or increase in the number of alerts, based on how your alert rules are set up according to the *Policy Severity* filter
* If you have configured your alert rules to send notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow, this shift in the number of alerts may result in sending notifications for the modified alert.

If you have any questions, contact your Customer Success Representative.


|*New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts*
//RLP-60053, RLP-66941

|New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts are expected to be available in the February 2023 release. The existing Prisma Cloud AWS onboarding APIs will be available for 90 days after the new APIs are released.

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433
|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.3.1.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.
