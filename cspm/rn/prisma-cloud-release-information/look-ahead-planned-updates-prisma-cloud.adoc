=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Changes to Policy Severity Level*
//RLP-90803

|Beginning with the 23.4.1 release, Prisma Cloud will make changes to our system default policies to help you identify the critical alerts and ensure that you can address them efficiently. The severity levels of the system default policies will be modified as part of the planned update. For more information, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/policy-severity-level-changes.csv[list of policies] that are affected.

*Impact-* You may see:

* Changes in the severity of existing alerts
* Changes in your overall compliance status due to the modified severity of alerts
* Decrease or increase in the number of alerts, based on how your alert rules are set up according to the *Policy Severity* filter
* If you have configured your alert rules to send notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow, this shift in the number of alerts may result in sending notifications for the modified alert.

If you have any questions, contact your Customer Success Representative.

|*New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts*
RLP-60053, RLP-66941

|New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts are expected to be available in the March 2023 release. The existing Prisma Cloud AWS onboarding APIs will be available for 90 days after the new APIs are released.
</draft-comment>+++

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433

|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Configure Flow Logs] with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required.


|*Global Region Support for Target ssl proxy*
//RLP-91960

|Beginning with the 23.3.2 release, Prisma Cloud provides global region support for *gcloud-compute-target-ssl-proxy* API. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources are resolved as *Resource_Updated*, and new alerts will be generated against the policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for *gcloud-compute-target-ssl-proxy* start ingesting data again.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.3.2.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.


[#policy-updates]
=== Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|====
|*POLICY UPDATES*
|*DESCRIPTION*

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*AWS access keys not used for more than 90 days*
//RLP-91610

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and RQL are updated to meet the compliance standard of 45 days.

*Updated Policy name—* AWS Access key not used for more than 45 days

*Updated Description—* This policy identifies IAM users for which access keys are not used for more than 45 days. Access keys allow users programmatic access to resources. However, if any access key has not been used in the past 45 days, then that access key needs to be deleted (even though the access key is inactive).

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type ='aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-credential-report' AND json.rule = '(access_key_1_active is true and ((access_key_1_last_used_date != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_1_last_used_date) > 90) or (access_key_1_last_used_date == N/A and access_key_1_last_rotated != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_1_last_rotated) > 90))) or (access_key_2_active is true and ((access_key_2_last_used_date != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_2_last_used_date) > 90) or (access_key_2_last_used_date == N/A and access_key_2_last_rotated != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_2_last_rotated) > 90)))'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type ='aws' and api.name = 'aws-iam-get-credential-report' AND json.rule = '(access_key_1_active is true and ((access_key_1_last_used_date != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_1_last_used_date) > 45) or (access_key_1_last_used_date == N/A and access_key_1_last_rotated != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_1_last_rotated) > 45))) or (access_key_2_active is true and ((access_key_2_last_used_date != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_2_last_used_date) > 45) or (access_key_2_last_used_date == N/A and access_key_2_last_rotated != N/A and _DateTime.ageInDays(access_key_2_last_rotated) > 45)))'
----

*Impact—* High. The alert count will increase for access keys that have not been used in more than 45 days.


|*GCP VM disks not encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)*
//RLP-91952

|*Changes—* The policy RQL is updated to check the GCP compute disks that are not encrypted with CSEK.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcp-compute-disk-list' AND json.rule = diskEncryptionKey does not exist and name does not start with "gke-" and status equals READY
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcp-compute-disk-list' AND json.rule = status equals READY and name does not start with "gke-" and diskEncryptionKey.sha256 does not exist
----

*Impact—* Low. New alerts may be generated when the VM disks are not encrypted with CSEK. No impact on existing alerts.
