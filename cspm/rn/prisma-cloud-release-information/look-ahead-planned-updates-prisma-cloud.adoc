|*DNS as a Policy Subtype*
|On *Policies* and menu:Alerts[Overview], a new *Policy Subtype* for *DNS* displays. Because the DNS anomaly policies are not generally available (GA), you will be unable to view the policies or detect any violations against these new policies unless you are part of the Limited GA release.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:

[.procedure]
. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-22.11.1

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*


|*AWS VPC endpoint policy is overly permissive*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-77978</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—*The policy RQL has been updated to check for only VPC Gateway Endpoints. Also, the policy name, description, and recommendation steps have been updated.

*Current Name—*AWS VPC endpoint policy is overly permissive disabled

*Updated Name—*AWS VPC gateway endpoint policy is overly permissive

*Updated Description—*Identifies VPC gateway endpoints that have a VPC endpoint (VPCE) policy that is overly permissive. When the Principal element value is set to '*' within the access policy, the VPC gateway endpoint allows full access to any IAM user or service within the VPC using credentials from any AWS accounts. It is highly recommended to have the least privileged VPCE policy to protect the data leakage and unauthorized access.

*Current RQL—*
+
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-describe-vpc-endpoints' AND json.rule = policyDocument.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Action contains * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*
+
----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-describe-vpc-endpoints' AND json.rule = vpcEndpointType equals Gateway and policyDocument.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal.AWS equals * or Principal equals *) and Action contains * and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Impact—*Medium. Existing open alerts related to VPC Endpoint's other than Gateway will be resolved and resolution status will be updated as Policy_Updated.


|*AWS RDS minor upgrades not enabled*
+

+++<draft-comment>RLP-79541</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—*The policy RQL has been updated to check if the RDS DB instances are in the “available” state.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = autoMinorVersionUpgrade is false and engine does not contain docdb and engine does not contain neptune
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-rds-describe-db-instances' AND json.rule = dbinstanceStatus equals available and autoMinorVersionUpgrade is false and engine does not contain docdb and engine does not contain neptune
----

*Impact—*Medium. Existing open alerts related to RDS instances which are not in the available state will be resolved and resolution status will be updated as Policy_Updated.


|*Azure AKS cluster pool profile count contains less than 3 nodes*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-78655</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—*The policy RQL has been updated with new syntax to increase accuracy and the remediation details are updated to reflect the CSP UI changes.

*Updated Description—*Identifies AKS clusters that are configured with node pool profile less than 3 nodes. It is recommended to have at least 3 or more than 3 nodes in a node pool for a more resilient cluster. (Clusters smaller than 3 may experience downtime during upgrades.)

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule =  "properties.agentPoolProfiles[?(@.type == 'AvailabilitySet')].count < 3"
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kubernetes-cluster' AND json.rule = 'properties.powerState.code equal ignore case Running and properties.agentPoolProfiles[?any(type equal ignore case AvailabilitySet and count less than 3)] exists'
----

*Impact—*Low. The alerts generated for stopped resources are resolved with resolution status as Policy_Updated.


|*Azure Front Door does not have the Azure Web application firewall (WAF) enabled*
+

+++<draft-comment>RLP-79700</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—*The policy RQL has been updated to provide more accuracy in alert results.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor-waf-policy' as Y; filter '$.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id does not exist or ($.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id contains $.Y.name and $.Y.properties.policySettings.enabledState equals Disabled)'; show X;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'azure-frontdoor-waf-policy' as Y; filter '$.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id does not exist or ($.X.properties.frontendEndpoints[*].properties.webApplicationFirewallPolicyLink.id equals $.Y.id and $.Y.properties.policySettings.enabledState equals Disabled)'; show X;
----

*Impact—*Low. The alerts are resolved with resolution status as Policy_Updated.


|*GCP PostgreSQL instance database flag log_statement is not set appropriately*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-72950</draft-comment>+++
|*Changes—*The policy RQL has been updated to reduced false alerts by changing the contain operator to equals. Due to this, collision with similar flag names such as userinput:[log_statement_stats] will be avoided.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-sql-instances-list' AND json.rule = "state equals RUNNABLE and databaseVersion contains POSTGRES and (settings.databaseFlags[*].name does not contain log_statement or settings.databaseFlags[?any(name contains log_statement and value contains all or value contains none )] exists)"
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-sql-instances-list' AND json.rule = state equals RUNNABLE and databaseVersion contains POSTGRES and ( settings.databaseFlags[?any( name equals "log_statement" )] does not exist or settings.databaseFlags[?any( name equals "log_statement" and value equals "all" or value equals "none" )] exists)
----

*Impact—*Previously generated alerts due to collision with similar flag names will be resolved as Policy_Updated.
