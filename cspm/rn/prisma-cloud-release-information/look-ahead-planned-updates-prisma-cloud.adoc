[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|tt:[Enhancement] *Role Assignment Modification for SSO Sign-In*
//RLP-79486

|Updates to SSO role assignments enable you to further harden your security posture, by preventing overly-permissive access to your cloud resources. User roles with third party and Just in Time (JIT) SSO enabled can no longer be modified.  

Role management for SSO enabled tenancies with auto-provisioning will now need to be completed from the Identity provider (IDP) for users on the SSO Bypass List. If a user logs in via the Prisma Cloud UI there will be no change. However, when logging in via SSO, user roles will be modified to reflect the role defined in the IDP. 


|*New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts*
//RLP-60053

|New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts are expected to be available in the February 2023 release. The existing Prisma Cloud AWS onboarding APIs will be available for 90 days after the new APIs are released.

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433
|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.1.2

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|DESCRIPTION

|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for Resource Manager*

//RLP-76226

|This policy identifies Azure Microsoft Defenders with defender settings for Resource Manager (ARM) set to Off. Enabling Azure Defender for ARM provides protection against issues like suspicious resource management operations, use of exploitation tool kits, lateral movement from the Azure management layer to the Azure resources data plane.
