=== Changes in Existing Behavior

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts*
//RLP-60053

|New APIs for onboarding AWS cloud accounts are expected to be available in the February 2023 release. The existing Prisma Cloud AWS onboarding APIs will be available for 90 days after the new APIs are released.

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*
//RLP-76433
|If you are using S3 to ingest AWS flow logs with the 24 hour partition, you are required to switch to the hourly partition by March 15, 2023.

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/enable-flow-logs-for-amazon-s3[Configure Flow Logs] with the hourly partition and enable the additional fields required.


|*Update to the Google VPC Network API*
//RLP-85372

|Prisma Cloud will provide global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for the *gcloud-compute-networks-list* API. As a result, all resources for this API will be deleted once and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-compute-networks-list* API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:

[.procedure]
. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents the current Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.1.2

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|*Azure SQL Server allow access to any Azure internal resources*
//RLP-87564

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure log profile not capturing activity logs for all regions*
//RLP-87560

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure subscriptions with custom roles are overly permissive*
//RLP-87520

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies azure subscriptions with custom roles are overly permissive. Least privilege access rule should be followed and only necessary privileges should be assigned instead of allowing full administrative access.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

|*Azure storage account has a blob container with public access*
//RLP-87470

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Storage Account 'Trusted Microsoft Services' access not enabled*
//RLP-86542

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Storage Accounts which have 'Trusted Microsoft Services' access not enabled. Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. If the Allow trusted Microsoft services exception is enabled, the following services: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Networking, Azure Monitor and Azure SQL Data Warehouse (when registered in the subscription), are granted access to the storage account. It is recommended to enable Trusted Microsoft Services on storage account instead of leveraging network rules.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure storage account logging for queues is disabled*
//RLP-86483

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Storage Accounts without Secure transfer enabled*
//RLP-86367

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Current Policy Name—* Storage Accounts without Secure transfer enabled
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure Storage Account without Secure transfer enabled

*Updated Policy Description—* 
identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. When 'secure transfer required' is enabled, REST APIs to access your storage accounts connect using HTTPs any requests using HTTP will be rejected. When you are using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail. It is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.

[NOTE]
====
Azure storage does not support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name.
====

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Storage accounts soft delete is disabled*
//RLP-86280

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and remediation CLI descriptions have been updated.

*Current Policy Name—* Azure Storage accounts soft delete is disabled

*Updated Policy Name—* Azure Storage account soft delete is disabled

*Updated Policy Description—*
Identifies Azure Storage accounts which has soft delete disabled. Azure Storage contains important access logs, financial data, personal and other secret information which is accidentally deleted by a user or application could cause data loss or data unavailability. It is recommended to enable soft delete setting in Azure Storage accounts.

*Updated Remediation CLI Description—*
This CLI command requires 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/write' permission. Successful execution will enable soft delete for blobs on Azure Storage accounts. NOTE: As best practice we are setting delete retention days to 30 days; it can be changed based on customer requirement by cloning the policy.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatic provisioning of log Analytics agent for Azure VMs is set to Off*
//RLP-85265

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.
