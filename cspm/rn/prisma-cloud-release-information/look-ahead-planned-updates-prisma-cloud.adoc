[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents rrent Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.8.3.

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Updates to Attack Path Policy Names*
//RLP-109870
|All https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/attack-path-policy-name-changes.pdf[Attack Path policy names] are being revised to use a new format to help you identify the risks and impact better. 

*Impact—* No impact since only the policy names will be updated.

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) with listener TLS/SSL is not configured*
//RLP-110135
|*Changes—* The policy RQL will updated to not trigger an alert when the HTTP listener requests are redirected to HTTPS URL.

*Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = state.code contains active and listeners[?any( protocol equals HTTP or protocol equals TCP or protocol equals UDP or protocol equals TCP_UDP )] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elbv2-target-group' AND json.rule = targetType does not equal alb and protocol exists and protocol is not member of ('TLS', 'HTTPS') as Y; filter '$.X.listeners[?any( protocol equals HTTP or protocol equals UDP or protocol equals TCP_UDP )] exists or ( $.X.listeners[*].protocol equals TCP and $.X.listeners[*].defaultActions[*].targetGroupArn contains $.Y.targetGroupArn)'; show X;
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = state.code contains active and listeners[?any( protocol is member of (HTTP,TCP,UDP,TCP_UDP) and defaultActions[?any( redirectConfig.protocol contains HTTPS)] does not exist )] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elbv2-target-group' AND json.rule = targetType does not equal alb and protocol exists and protocol is not member of ('TLS', 'HTTPS') as Y; filter '$.X.listeners[?any( protocol equals HTTP or protocol equals UDP or protocol equals TCP_UDP )] exists or ( $.X.listeners[].protocol equals TCP and $.X.listeners[].defaultActions[*].targetGroupArn contains $.Y.targetGroupArn)'; show X;
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts where the Listener requests are redirected to HTTPS URL will be resolved.

|*GCP VM instance configured with default service account*
//RLP-102252
|*Changes—* The policy RQL will updated to check for Default Service Accounts with editor role.

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = (status equals RUNNING and name does not start with "gke-") and serviceAccounts[?any( email contains "compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com")] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-projects-get-iam-user' AND json.rule = user contains "compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" and roles[*] contains "roles/editor" as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcloud-compute-instances-list' AND json.rule = (status equals RUNNING and name does not start with "gke-") and serviceAccounts[?any( email contains "compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com")] exists as Y; filter '$.Y.serviceAccounts[*].email contains $.X.user'; show Y;
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts where they do not have editor role attached to default service account will be resolved.

//RLP-109469

Prisma Cloud will update the following Azure IAM out-of-the-box (OOTB) policies:

|POLICY NAME
|DESCRIPTION
|CURRENT RQL
|UPDATED RQL

|*Azure VM instance associated managed identities with Key Vault management access (data access is not included)*

|With access to 'Microsoft.KeyVault' service, an adversary can elevate the access of the VM instance, expanding the surface of the attack and granting access to cloud resources with sensitive information

|----
config from iam where source.cloud.type = 'Azure' AND grantedby.cloud.entity.type IN ( 'System Assigned', 'User Assigned' ) AND dest.cloud.service.name = 'Microsoft.KeyVault' AND source.cloud.service.name = 'Microsoft.Compute'

----

|*Azure Managed Identity (user assigned or system assigned) with broad Key Vault management access*

|Managed identities provide an automatic way for applications to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Providing Key Vault management access lets non-human identities manage key vaults. The least privilege model should be enforced and unused sensitive permissions should be revoked.

|----

|*Azure Service Principals with broad Key Vault management access*

|Service Principles provide an automatic way for applications to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Providing Key Vault management access lets non-human identities manage key vaults. The least privilege model should be enforced and unused sensitive permissions should be revoked

|----

|*Azure AD users with broad Key Vault management access*
//RLP-109469
|Providing Key Vault access lets users manage key vaults. The least privilege model should be enforced and unused sensitive permissions should be revoked
