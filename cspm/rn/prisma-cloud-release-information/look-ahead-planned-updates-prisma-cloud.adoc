=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents rrent Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-23.9.2

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY NAME
|DESCRIPTION
|RQL
|CLOUD TYPE
|SEVERITY

|*EC2 with IAM role attached has iam:PassRole and ec2:Run Instances permissions*

|This IAM policy enforces controlled access by permitting only the specified actions (iam:PassRole, ec2:RunInstances) within AWS, specifically for 'instance' resources. By limiting the scope of permissions to this focused context, potential risks and unauthorized activity are mitigated.

|----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' AND action.name IN ('iam:PassRole','ec2:RunInstances') AND source.cloud.service.name = 'ec2' AND source.cloud.resource.type = 'instance' AND source.cloud.type = 'AWS'
----

|*AWS role having iam:PassRole and lambda:InvokeFunction permissions attached to EC2 instance*

|This IAM policy is meticulously designed to address potential vulnerabilities arising from an AWS EC2 instance with specific permissions. The 'iam:PassRole' action, coupled with 'lambda:CreateFunction' and 'lambda:InvokeFunction', holds the potential for adversaries to exploit and escalate privileges. By strategically controlling access to these actions within the 'ec2' service, this policy effectively mitigates the risk of unauthorized creation and manipulation of Lambda functions, safeguarding against potential escalation of privileges and maintaining the integrity of your system.

|----
config from iam where dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' AND action.name IN ('iam:PassRole','lambda:CreateFunction', 'lambda:InvokeFunction') AND source.cloud.service.name = 'ec2' AND source.cloud.resource.type = 'instance' AND source.cloud.type = 'AWS'
