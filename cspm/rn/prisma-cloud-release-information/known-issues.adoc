|*ISSUE ID*
|*DESCRIPTION*

|*RLP-96126* tt:[Fixed in 23.5.1]
//Remove in 6.1
|Prisma Cloud was not able to ingest metadata for all the userinput:[aws-route53resolver-query-logging-config] API resources even if any one of them did not include the userinput:[route53resolver:ListTagsForResource] permission.

With this fix, Prisma Cloud can now ingest metadata for all the userinput:[aws-route53resolver-query-logging-config] API resources except for the ones with the missing permission.

|*RLP-96722* tt:[Fixed in 23.4.2]
//Raised in 23.4.2,PCDTUS-32, remove in 5.2
|Clicking an S3 bucket on the *Data Settings* page would redirect to an incorrect assetID and would display *Asset Not Found* error. This issue has been fixed.

|*RLP-98082* tt:[Fixed in 23.4.2]
//Raised in 23.4.1, remove in 5.2
|PCDS Azure only—Prisma Cloud was not able to create event grid subscriptions on storage accounts in a few regions due to which it couldn’t do forward scan on those storage accounts. This issue has been fixed.

|*RLP-95559*
//Raised in 23.3.1

|Prisma Cloud does not support Azurerm versions 3.44.0, 3.45.0, and 3.46.0, which causes an error when you run the Terraform script during Azure onboarding. To resolve this error, update the terraform script that you downloaded from Prisma Cloud by changing the Azurerm version:
From:
[userinput]
----
azurerm = {
      version = ">= 2.49.0"
    }
----
To:
[userinput]
----
azurerm = {
      version = "= 3.43.0"
    }
----
And then run the following command:
[userinput]
----
terraform init -upgrade
----

|*RLP-90184*
//Raised in 23.2.1

|The behavior of filters on the *Alerts Overview* page is slightly different from that on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages. On the *Alerts Overview* page when you select the userinput:[Asset Class], userinput:[Resource Type], and userinput:[Service Name] filters, the alerts displayed are a combination of those three selected filters. Whereas on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages, the preference is given to userinput:[Resource Type] over userinput:[Service Name] when both those filters are selected due to which the assets for which alerts are displayed on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages do not match those displayed on the *Alerts Overview* page.


|*RLP-62558*
//Raised in 23.1.2
|The resource name displayed on the Alerts L2 page does not match the name displayed for the same resource on the Asset Explorer page.



|*—* 
|Dashboard widgets don't load for a large data set where the time window is also large.
// *July 2018*


|*—* 
|The userinput:[aws-ecs-describe-task-definition] and userinput:[aws-emr-describe-cluster] APIs now run once every 24 hours to generate alerts. If you have cloud accounts with a significant amount of ECS/EMR resources, the resource status is updated once a day.


|*—* 
//PCSUP-13188
|The configuration build policies are displayed even if you have not enabled Code Security module.


|*-*
//PCSUP-13468
|Currently when you edit default policies in the Code Security module, the policy is duplicated with the updated metadata. Both the unedited policy and the edited policy are then visible on *Projects* when the *Status- Suppressed* (for the original policy) and *Errors* (for the edited policy) are enabled.


|*RLP-73807*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, Compute alerts are not displayed in the Resource Explorer audit trail.


|*RLP-68751*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, only System Administrators can view the Compute assets and not other users. Compute alerts will not be accessible on Alerts pages for all users except System Administrators.


|*—*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, the Asset Detail view does not display at all times, the legacy Resource Explorer is displayed instead.

+++<draft-comment>PCSUP-6369, 7878. Need to track this and mark it as fixed.</draft-comment>+++
|AWS CloudTrail in the Osaka region (ap-northeast-3) do not display on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

This issue requires a fix on AWS. When fixed on AWS, the issue will be automatically resolved on Prisma Cloud.


|*RLP-78777*
+++<draft-comment>Blurb shared by Arun</draft-comment>+++
|The AWS Global Accelerator service returns an Access Denied error with the error assumed-role/PrismaCloudReadOnlyRole/redlock is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole on resource. The issue occurs because the userinput:[aws-global-accelerator-accelerator] API requires you to enable the service-linked IAM role to ingest metadata. To resolve the error, add the role to include the required permissions.

*Workaround*: If you do not want to enable the service-linked role, create a support ticket with Palo Alto Networks Technical Support to disable the AWS Global Accelerator service API.


|*RLP-72605*
|The list of alert counts that correspond to a policy are inaccurate when you select more than one alert rule name. This issue is seen on:

* The *Alerts > Overview*, when you select multiple Alert Rule Names in the filter, the results for the number of alerts that correspond to a policy is not accurate. The Alert Rule Filter works as expected when you select only one Alert Rule Name.

* When you use the userinput:[POST/alerts/policy] API, make sure to include only one Alert Rule Name for the userinput:[filters] attribute in the request body schema.


|*RLP-75376*
|*PCDS Azure only—* If you have enabled public access from selected IP addresses on storage account with Prisma Cloud NAT IPs and Azure outbound IPs added to the allow list, ingestion fails with 403 error (permission denied).


|*RLP-65612*
|*PCDS Azure only—* The *Inventory* page may display 400 error if data is not available.


|*RLP-65602*
|*PCDS Azure only—* During onboarding when you enter the *Client ID* and *Secret*, if the Secret exceeds the specified length, a bad request error displays.


|*RLP-65286*
+++<draft-comment>PCSUP-8439</draft-comment>+++
|When integrating Prisma Cloud with Jira, if the Jira userinput:[issueType] field uses space as a separator between the words, such as userinput:[Service Request] or userinput:[New Feature] , a 500 Internal Server error occurs while configuring Typeahead fields such as Reporter or Assignee, in a Notification Template. You will be unable to create a Notification Template for Jira with the Typeahead fields.

*Workaround*: Rename the field to remove the space or add an underscore. For example, userinput:[ServiceRequest] or userinput:[New_Feature]. You can then add Typeahead fields in a Notification Template.

+++<draft-comment>RLP-70084, PCSUP-8587</draft-comment>+++
|If you have configured multiple flow logs for a VPC and if any of the flow logs are incorrectly configured, the flow log status on Prisma Cloud is reported as a warning (Amber). This status does not impact ingestion for all the correctly configured flow logs.


|*RLP—60005*
|Prisma Cloud may not process some of the delete bucket events, due to which the buckets that you have deleted in the AWS console will be visible in the Prisma Cloud *Inventory* page.


|*RLP-59655*
|Prisma Cloud supports user attribution, but there may be some delay when generating user attribution for an alert, even when menu:Settings[Enterprise Settings > Alerts User Attribution] is enabled.


|*RLP—58180*
+++<draft-comment>added for PCSUP-7729 in 22.2.1</draft-comment>+++
|On menu:Inventory[Assets], OKE clusters (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) deployed in Santiago region do not display. You can view resources for other https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/cloud-service-provider-regions-on-prisma-cloud.html[supported regions].


|*RLP—57331*
|The *Compute* tab displays with a provisioning message for Business Edition license on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The Compute tab should not display for the Business Edition license.


|*RLP—55763*
|This fix may trigger alerts to be opened or closed as applicable.


|*RLP—55036*
|When changing the *Maximum time before access keys expire* value for access keys, it may take up to 15 minutes for the updates to take effect.


|*RLP-53374*
+++<draft-comment>PCSUP-6358</draft-comment>+++
|On occasion, alerts generated against Network Policies can be less accurate when the policy includes the RQL attribute *dest.resource IN (resource where role*.

In these cases, a policy match occurs because the resource such as a web server, ELB, or NAT Gateway either may not have been classified by the engine yet or the classification is no longer applicable when flow logs are analyzed to detect a violation. In such instances, you have to triage and close the alert manually.


|*RLP-40248*
|When you create an alert rule and specify target resource tags, Prisma Cloud processes only a single resource tag key/value pair properly. Proper processing of multiple resource tags or resource tags with multiple values is not guaranteed. This behavior exists whether you create the alert rule through the Prisma Cloud console or through the CSPM API.

|Due to performance challenges with Azure Resource Groups, the auto completion using RQL on the *Investigate* page, is temporarily paused until we address the issue. When you use userinput:[azure.resource.group] as an attribute in your query, for example, userinput:[config from cloud.resource where azure.resource.group =] , you will only see the option to enter a string.

[NOTE]
====
The RQL continues to work as expected and any existing policy or saved search that uses the userinput:[azure.resource.group] attribute is not affected.
====


|*RLP—27773*
|Alerts generated for policies that reference the userinput:[azure-disk-list] API are resolved and reopened intermittently.


|*RLP-27427* 
|*Applies to Prisma Cloud Data Security only*

Malware report is not available in PDF format.


|*RLP-25117*
|*Applies to Prisma Cloud Data Security only*

The Dashboard displays an error when you select an account group that does not contain any accounts.


|*RLP—19480*
|The Business Unit Report does not support multi-byte characters used in languages such as Japanese.


|*RLP—19470*
|The Business Unit Report csv file lists all enabled policies even when there are no open alerts, because there are no resources to scan.


|*RLP—14469*
|When you enable Dataflow compression for a cloud account, the subnetwork creation status may display a failure message on the onboarding status page. This error displays because the time threshold to create the subnetwork and report completion exceeds the response time threshold on Prisma Cloud.

*Workaround—* Click to the previous page and click next to load the status page again.

+++<draft-comment>marked as wont fix</draft-comment>+++


|*RLP—13485*
|If you have the maximum number of VPCs (5) already created in the project and then you enable flowlog compression, the onboarding fails because Prisma Cloud is unable to add the network needed to enable Dataflow compression. When this happens the remediation steps in the message that displays is incorrect.


|*RLP—9723* 
|The integration status check for Jira displays as yellow instead of red even if the integration is misconfigured.
