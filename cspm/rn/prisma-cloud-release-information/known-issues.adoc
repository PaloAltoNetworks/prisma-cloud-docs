|*ISSUE ID*
|*DESCRIPTION*


|*RLP-102046*
//Notification Channel Support for Attack Path Policies - Raised in 23.5.2. Verify if fixed once Hyperion is GA and then remove from this list.

|Prisma Cloud currently supports only Email, Jira, ServiceNow, Splunk, and SQS as the notification channels for the following attack path policies:

* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and port scan activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and ransomware activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and unusual high volume data transfer activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and cryptomining domain request activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and DGA domain request activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and malware activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and botnet activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and cryptominer activity
* AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and backdoor activity
* AWS EC2 instance with s3:GetObject permission is publicly exposed and not configured with Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2)
* AWS EC2 instance with iam:PassRole and ec2:RunInstances permissions is publicly exposed
* AWS EC2 instance with ORG level WRITE permissions is publicly exposed
* AWS EC2 instance with Critical/High exploitable vulnerability is publicly exposed
* AWS EC2 instance with iam:PassRole and lambda:InvokeFunction permissions is publicly exposed

|*RLP-90184*
//Raised in 23.2.1

|The behavior of filters on the *Alerts Overview* page is slightly different from that on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages. On the *Alerts Overview* page when you select the userinput:[Asset Class], userinput:[Resource Type], and userinput:[Service Name] filters, the alerts displayed are a combination of those three selected filters. Whereas on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages, the preference is given to userinput:[Resource Type] over userinput:[Service Name] when both those filters are selected due to which the assets for which alerts are displayed on the *Asset Inventory* and *Asset Explorer* pages do not match those displayed on the *Alerts Overview* page.


|*RLP-78777*
//Blurb shared by Arun

|The AWS Global Accelerator service returns an Access Denied error with the error assumed-role/PrismaCloudReadOnlyRole/redlock is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole on resource. The issue occurs because the userinput:[aws-global-accelerator-accelerator] API requires you to enable the service-linked IAM role to ingest metadata. To resolve the error, add the role to include the required permissions.

*Workaround*: If you do not want to enable the service-linked role, create a support ticket with Palo Alto Networks Technical Support to disable the AWS Global Accelerator service API.


|*RLP-73807*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, Compute alerts are not displayed in the Resource Explorer audit trail.


|*RLP-72605*
|The list of alert counts that correspond to a policy are inaccurate when you select more than one alert rule name. This issue is seen on:

* The *Alerts > Overview*, when you select multiple Alert Rule Names in the filter, the results for the number of alerts that correspond to a policy is not accurate. The Alert Rule Filter works as expected when you select only one Alert Rule Name.

* When you use the userinput:[POST/alerts/policy] API, make sure to include only one Alert Rule Name for the userinput:[filters] attribute in the request body schema.


|*RLP-75376*
|*PCDS Azure only—* If you have enabled public access from selected IP addresses on storage account with Prisma Cloud NAT IPs and Azure outbound IPs added to the allow list, ingestion fails with 403 error (permission denied).


|*RLP-65612*
|*PCDS Azure only—* The *Inventory* page may display 400 error if data is not available.


|*RLP-65602*
|*PCDS Azure only—* During onboarding when you enter the *Client ID* and *Secret*, if the Secret exceeds the specified length, a bad request error displays.


|*RLP-68751*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, only System Administrators can view the Compute assets and not other users. Compute alerts will not be accessible on Alerts pages for all users except System Administrators.


|*RLP-65286*
//PCSUP-8439
|When integrating Prisma Cloud with Jira, if the Jira userinput:[issueType] field uses space as a separator between the words, such as userinput:[Service Request] or userinput:[New Feature] , a 500 Internal Server error occurs while configuring Typeahead fields such as Reporter or Assignee, in a Notification Template. You will be unable to create a Notification Template for Jira with the Typeahead fields.

*Workaround*: Rename the field to remove the space or add an underscore. For example, userinput:[ServiceRequest] or userinput:[New_Feature]. You can then add Typeahead fields in a Notification Template.


|*RLP-65216*
//RLP-70084, PCSUP-8587
|If you have configured multiple flow logs for a VPC and if any of the flow logs are incorrectly configured, the flow log status on Prisma Cloud is reported as a warning (Amber). This status does not impact ingestion for all the correctly configured flow logs.


|*RLP-62558*
//Raised in 23.1.2
|The resource name displayed on the Alerts L2 page does not match the name displayed for the same resource on the Asset Explorer page.


|*RLP-60005*
|Prisma Cloud may not process some of the delete bucket events, due to which the buckets that you have deleted in the AWS console will be visible in the Prisma Cloud *Inventory* page.


//*RLP-59655* - Removing per confirmation from Shital Katkar
//Prisma Cloud supports user attribution, but there may be some delay when generating user attribution for an alert, even when menu:Settings[Enterprise Settings > Alerts User Attribution] is enabled.


//*RLP-58180* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket, marked as fixed.
//Added for PCSUP-7729 in 22.2.1.
//On menu:Inventory[Assets], OKE clusters (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) deployed in Santiago region do not display. You can view resources for other https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/cloud-service-provider-regions-on-prisma-cloud.html[supported regions].


//*RLP-57331* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket.
//The *Compute* tab displays with a provisioning message for Business Edition license on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The Compute tab should not display for the Business Edition license.


//*RLP-55763* - Removing this as a Known Issue per the ticket.
//This fix may trigger alerts to be opened or closed as applicable.


|*RLP-55036*
|When changing the *Maximum time before access keys expire* value for access keys, it may take up to 15 minutes for the updates to take effect.


//*RLP-53374*
//PCSUP-6358 - Removed per confirmation from Santosh Kadli
//On occasion, alerts generated against Network Policies can be less accurate when the policy includes the RQL attribute *dest.resource IN (resource where role*.

//In these cases, a policy match occurs because the resource such as a web server, ELB, or NAT Gateway either may not have been classified by the engine yet or the classification is no longer applicable when flow logs are analyzed to detect a violation. In such instances, you have to triage and close the alert manually.


|*RLP-40248*
//Open to review of this text.
|When you create an alert rule and specify target resource tags, Prisma Cloud processes only a single resource tag key/value pair properly. Proper processing of multiple resource tags or resource tags with multiple values is not guaranteed. This behavior exists whether you create the alert rule through the Prisma Cloud console or through the CSPM API.


|*RLP-30805*
//RLP-30762
|Due to performance challenges with Azure Resource Groups, the auto completion using RQL on the *Investigate* page, is temporarily paused until we address the issue. When you use userinput:[azure.resource.group] as an attribute in your query, for example, userinput:[config from cloud.resource where azure.resource.group =] , you will only see the option to enter a string.

[NOTE]
====
The RQL continues to work as expected and any existing policy or saved search that uses the userinput:[azure.resource.group] attribute is not affected.
====


|*RLP-27773*
|Alerts generated for policies that reference the userinput:[azure-disk-list] API are resolved and reopened intermittently.


|*RLP-27427* 
|*Applies to Prisma Cloud Data Security only*

Malware report is not available in PDF format.


|*RLP-25117*
//marked as moving too v2 since it's not a must fix
|*Applies to Prisma Cloud Data Security only*
The Dashboard displays an error when you select an account group that does not contain any accounts.


|*RLP-19480*
|The Business Unit Report does not support multi-byte characters used in languages such as Japanese.


|*RLP-19470*
|The Business Unit Report csv file lists all enabled policies even when there are no open alerts, because there are no resources to scan.


|*RLP-14469*
//Marked as won't fix.
|When you enable Dataflow compression for a cloud account, the subnetwork creation status may display a failure message on the onboarding status page. This error displays because the time threshold to create the subnetwork and report completion exceeds the response time threshold on Prisma Cloud.

*Workaround—* Click to the previous page and click next to load the status page again.


|*RLP-13485*
|If you have the maximum number of VPCs (5) already created in the project and you then enable flowlog compression, the onboarding fails because Prisma Cloud is unable to add the network needed to enable Dataflow compression. When this happens the remediation steps in the message that displays is incorrect.


|*RLP-9723* 
|The integration status check for Jira displays as yellow instead of red even if the integration is misconfigured.


|*—* 
// *July 2018*
|Dashboard widgets don't load for a large data set where the time window is also large.


|*—* 
|The userinput:[aws-ecs-describe-task-definition] and userinput:[aws-emr-describe-cluster] APIs now run once every 24 hours to generate alerts. If you have cloud accounts with a significant amount of ECS/EMR resources, the resource status is updated once a day.


|*—* 
//PCSUP-13188
|The configuration build policies are displayed even if you have not enabled Code Security module.

|*—* 

tt:[Fixed in 23.6.2]
//RLP-103813

|With 23.6.2 the recently added configuration build policies are removed and the total policy count is reduced by 120. This has no impact as these policies did not generate any violations.


|*—*
//PCSUP-13468
|Currently when you edit default policies in the Code Security module, the policy is duplicated with the updated metadata. Both the unedited policy and the edited policy are then visible on *Projects* when the *Status- Suppressed* (for the original policy) and *Errors* (for the edited policy) are enabled.


|*—*
|In Unified Asset Inventory, the Asset Detail view does not display at all times, the legacy Resource Explorer is displayed instead.


|*—*
//PCSUP-6369, 7878. Need to track this and mark it as fixed.

|AWS CloudTrail in the Osaka region (ap-northeast-3) do not display on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

This issue requires a fix on AWS. When fixed on AWS, the issue will be automatically resolved on Prisma Cloud.
