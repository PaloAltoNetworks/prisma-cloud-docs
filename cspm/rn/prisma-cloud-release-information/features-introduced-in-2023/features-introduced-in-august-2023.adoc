|DESCRIPTION

|*Attack Path Analysis and Visualization*
//RLP-105197

|Prisma Cloud now includes attack path analysis and visualization that identifies attack paths and presents them in a graph view, offering valuable security context to protect against high-risk threats. It is an automated process that identifies the exposed vulnerable assets and indicates the likelihood of a breach which often requires immediate action. Whenever there is a policy violation, the attack path policy generates an alert as long as there is a matching alert rule. You can see additional information in the graph view by clicking on the node. Additionally, the asset detail view displays the finding types and vulnerabilities. To review these policies, select *Policies* and filter by Policy Type *Attack Path*. Attack Path policies are not available in China and Government regions.

|Credit Requirements Updates
//RLP-106498
| Starting August 1 2023, Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition will reduce the number of credits required. 

Visibility, Compliance, and Governance (for CSPM use cases) will only require 1 credit per virtual machine (AWS EC2s, Azure Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets, Google Cloud Google Compute Engine (GCE), Oracle Cloud (OCI) Compute, Alibaba Cloud ECS).
Load Balancers, NAT gateways, Databases and Data Warehouse cloud resources will no longer require credits.

IAM Security (for CIEM use cases) will only require 0.25 credit per virtual machine.
Load Balancers, NAT gateways, Databases and Data Warehouse cloud resources will no longer require credits.

Host Security credit requirements reduce from 1 to 0.5 credit per Host Defender.

Container Security credit requirements reduce from 7 to  5 credits per Container Defender.

Web Application and API Security credit requirements reduce from 30 to 2 credits per Defender performing inline protection.

The https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/guides/prisma-cloud-enterprise-edition-licensing-guide[Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Licensing Guide] will reflect these changes on August 1, 2023.

[#new-policies1]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Unusual Usage of Workload Credentials Anomaly Policies*
//RLP-99223
|Two new anomaly policies are now available on the Policies page in Prisma Cloud.

* Unusual usage of Workload Credentials from outside the Cloud
* Unusual usage of Workload Credentials from inside the Cloud

The policies detect the use of a credential assigned to a compute resource from a different resource, which could be outside or inside the cloud service provider. This is typically a sign of an attack or a very unusual use of resource credentials. The policies will be triggered based on whether the anomalous IP address is outside or inside the cloud provider’s IP address range. 

In addition to these policies, this release includes a new *Identity* section in the anomaly settings to configure the unusual usage of workload credentials from inside the Cloud policy.

Severity—Medium.

|*AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk associated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk Instance*
//RLP-106032
|Identifies AWS Route53 Hosted Zones which have dangling DNS records with subdomain takeover risk. A Route53 Hosted Zone having a CNAME entry pointing to a non-existing Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) will have a risk of these dangling domain entries being taken over by an attacker by creating a similar Elastic beanstalk (EBS) in any AWS account which the attacker owns / controls. Attackers can use this domain to do phishing attacks, spread malware and other illegal activities. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete dangling DNS records entry from your AWS Route 53 hosted zones.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-route53-list-hosted-zones' AND json.rule = hostedZone.config.privateZone is false and resourceRecordSet[?any( type equals CNAME and resourceRecords[*].value contains elasticbeanstalk.com)] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-environment' as Y; filter 'not (X.resourceRecordSet[*].resourceRecords[*].value intersects $.Y.cname)'; show X;
----

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* High


|*Azure App Service web apps with public network access*
//RLP-107375

|Identifies Azure App Service web apps that are publicly accessible. Publicly accessible web apps could allow malicious actors to remotely exploit if any vulnerabilities and could. It is recommended to configure the App Service web apps with private endpoints so that the web apps hosted are accessible only to restricted entities.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = 'kind starts with app and properties.state equal ignore case running and properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case Enabled and config.ipSecurityRestrictions[?any(action equals Allow and ipAddress equals Any)] exists'
----

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium

|*Azure Function app configured with public network access*
//RLP-107377

|Identifies Azure Function apps that are configured with public network access. Publicly accessible web apps could allow malicious actors to remotely exploit any vulnerabilities and could. It is recommended to configure the App Service web apps with private endpoints so that the functions hosted are accessible only to restricted entities.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-app-service' AND json.rule = kind starts with functionapp and properties.state equal ignore case running and properties.publicNetworkAccess exists and properties.publicNetworkAccess equal ignore case ENABLED
----

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium


|*Azure Data Explorer cluster double encryption is disabled*
//RLP-107734

|Identifies Azure Data Explorer clusters in which double encryption is disabled. Double encryption adds a second layer of encryption using service-managed keys. It is recommended to enable infrastructure double encryption on Data Explorer clusters so that encryption can be implemented at the layer closest to the storage device or network wires.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kusto-clusters' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Running and properties.enableDoubleEncryption is false
----

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Informational


|*Azure Data Explorer cluster disk encryption is disabled*
//RLP-107735

|Identifies Azure Data Explorer clusters in which disk encryption is disabled. Enabling encryption at rest on your cluster provides data protection for stored data. It is recommended to enable disk encryption on Data Explorer clusters.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-kusto-clusters' AND json.rule = properties.state equal ignore case Running and properties.enableDiskEncryption is false
----

*Policy Type—* Config

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*GCP VPC Flow logs for the subnet is set to Off*
//RLP-107254
|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to exclude checking for proxy-only subnets in the policy as VPC flow logs are not supported for proxy-only subnets.

*Severity—* Informational

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-networks-subnets-list' AND json.rule = purpose does not contain INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and (enableFlowLogs is false or enableFlowLogs does not exist)
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-compute-networks-subnets-list' AND json.rule = purpose does not contain INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and purpose does not contain "REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY" and (enableFlowLogs is false or enableFlowLogs does not exist)
----

*Impact—* Low. Alerts generated for proxy-only subnets will be resolved as *Policy_updated*.
