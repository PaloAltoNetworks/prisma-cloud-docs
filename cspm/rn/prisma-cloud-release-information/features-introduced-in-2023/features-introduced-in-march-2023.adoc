|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*GRBAC now available for Data Security*
//RLP-84904

|Granular Role Based Access Control (GRBAC) is now available for Data Security functionality in Prisma Cloud. You can now create Custom Roles with the option to *View*, *Create*, *Update* or *Delete* Data Security functions. GRBAC allows you to enforce least privileged access, giving you the option to create roles with the minimum amount of access to Data Security required for a users job function. Custom Role creation is limited to users with a current System Administrator role.

|*Vulnerabilities displayed in Command Center*
//RLP-89582 - Jen to share image and link

|The Command Center dashboard on the Prisma Cloud console now includes a snapshot view of Urgent Vulnerabilities, Top 5 Vulnerable Images, and Top 5 Vulnerable Hosts. Vulnerabilities triggering *Critical* and *High* alerts are grouped into these actionable views, giving you insight into the impacted resources in your environment and providing you with remediation options. You can view data for the past 30 days and also filter results by:

* *Time Range* - Viewable for the last day, week, month, or a customized time frame
* *Account Groups*
* *Cloud Accounts*

Currently, only System Administrators can view the Vulnerabilities widget.


|*Prisma Cloud Chronicles*
//RLP-84043, RLP-46093

|The Chronicles is a weekly email update to summarize your team’s usage of Prisma Cloud, suggest product adoption improvements and links to the Release Notes to show what's new, and provide actionable opportunities to secure your cloud environment.

|tt:[Enhancement] *Separate Text Boxes for Key and Value Entries*
//RLP-85984

|If you are using tags, you no longer need to use a colon (:) to separate key and value entries in a single text box while assigning resource tags on *Alert Overview* and *Asset Inventory*. You can now enter *Key* and *Value* in separate text boxes.

[#new-policies1]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Azure Anomaly Policies*
//RLP-91421

|The new Azure anomaly policies aim to:

* identify when an Azure compute workload employs potential Privilege Escalation or Defense Evasion tactics 
* detect when an Azure user is using Credential Access or Lateral Movement Tactics

The new policies that detect anomalies using the information in audit logs for your Azure cloud accounts are as follows:

* Azure Compute workload assigning roles to resources— Detects when an Azure Compute workload assigns a role to a resource, resource group, or subscription. 
* Azure Compute workload modifying Key Vault configurations— Detects when an Azure Compute workload modifies the configuration of a key vault. 
* Azure Compute workload deleting network security groups— Detects when an Azure Compute workload deletes network security groups. 
* Azure Compute workload disabling Azure alerts— Detects when an Azure Compute workload deletes Azure Monitor alert rules. 
* Azure Compute workload creating or modifying route tables— Detects when an Azure Compute workload creates or modifies Azure routing tables.
* Azure Compute workload disabling anti-malware extensions— Detects when an Azure Compute workload disables anti-malware extensions. 
* Azure user reading database master keys— Detects when an Azure user reads master keys from a Cosmos DB. 
* Azure user executing remote commands on virtual machines— Detects when an Azure user runs commands remotely on a virtual machine. 

Alerts for these anomaly policies are triggered after the audit logs from Azure cloud accounts are ingested, and the anomaly policies are added to an alert rule.

You also can specify a role in the anomaly trusted list to suppress the alerts. The specified anomaly policy will not generate alerts for the matching role names added to this trusted list.

|*Attack Path Policies*
//RLP-91967, RLP-91968

|To help prioritize alerts and mitigate security issues, Prisma Cloud provides 5 new Attack Path policies that are enabled with critical severity levels by default.

The policies with *Critical* severity are as follows:

* *Publicly exposed EC2 instance which is not configured with Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2) and is attached to an AWS role with s3:GetObject permission*

This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and not configured with Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2). With IMDSv2, every request is protected by session authentication. IMDSv2 protects against misconfigured-open website application firewalls, misconfigured-open reverse proxies, unpatched SSRF vulnerabilities, and misconfigured-open layer-3 firewalls and network address translation. As a best practice, only use IMDSv2 for all your EC2 instances. 

* *Publicly exposed EC2 instance which is attached to an AWS role with iam:PassRole and ec2:RunInstances permissions*

This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and are attached to an IAM role with risky permissions. EC2 instances associated with 'iam:PassRole','ec2:RunInstances' permissions can be used to escalate privileges by passing an existing IAM role to a new EC2 instance and moving laterally. It is highly recommended that you remove the risky permissions from the IAM role attached to EC2 instances. 

* *Publicly exposed EC2 instance which is attached to an AWS role with org level write permissions*

This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and are attached to an IAM role with risky ORG level WRITE permissions. EC2 instances having org level write permissions can be used to escalate privileges at the ORG level and move laterally between accounts. It is highly recommended to remove the risky permissions from the IAM role attached to EC2 instances. 

* *Publicly exposed EC2 instance with a Critical/High exploitable vulnerability*

This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have known exploitable vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the affected EC2 instance and perform malicious actions. As a best practice, remediate the Critical/High exploitable vulnerabilities reported for EC2 instances. 

* *Publicly exposed EC2 instance which is attached to an AWS role with iam:PassRole and lambda:InvokeFunction permissions*

This policy identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and are attached to an IAM role with risky permissions. EC2 instances having 'iam:PassRole','lambda:CreateFunction', 'lambda:InvokeFunction' permissions can be used to escalate privileges by passing an existing IAM role to a new Lambda function and moving laterally. As a best practice remove the risky permissions from the IAM role attached to EC2 instances.

|*Changes to Network Anomaly Policies*
//RLP-92983, RLP-93119 , Need to check with Ashwini regarding removing the link.

|The names of the network anomaly policies are modified to be self explanatory and also make it easier to identify cloud resources involved in the alerts reported by these policies. Additionally, the *Resource Name* column in the alert details for external network anomaly policies (excluding Port Sweep activity) now displays the internal resource (cloud instance) targeted or generating traffic instead of the public *IP address* of the source host participating in the suspicious activity.  

* The *Port Sweep activity (External)* network anomaly policy involves multiple internal resources and selecting only one can create confusion. In order to avoid confusion, *Port Sweep activity (External)* policy continues to display the public *IP address* in the *Resource Name*.
* The severity of the *Network data exfiltration activity* anomaly policy is changed from high to medium.

For more information, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/external-network-anomaly-policies-changes.pdf[list of policies] that are affected.

*Impact—* Only applies to any new alert generated by an anomaly policy. No impact on existing alerts.

[#new-compliance-benchmarks-and-updates1]
=== New Compliance Benchmarks and Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v4.0.6*

//RLP-85048
|Prisma Cloud now supports the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v4.0.6 compliance standard.

The CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing. It is a spreadsheet that contains a list of common frameworks and regulations that your organization must follow. Each control maps to a number of industry-accepted security standards, regulations, and frameworks, which means that completing the CCM controls also completes the accompanying standards and regulations. It reduces the need to use multiple frameworks and simplifies cloud security by displaying all common cloud standards in one place.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior1]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Google Compute SSL Policies Update*
//RLP-88378

|Prisma Cloud now includes a JSON update to increase the visibility and monitoring of *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* API resources. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console. 

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against the policy violations.

*Impact—* You may notice an increased count for the number of alerts for the following OOTB policies:

* GCP HTTPS Load balancer SSL Policy not using restrictive profile
* GCP Load Balancer HTTPS proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP Load Balancer SSL proxy permits SSL policies with weak cipher suites
* GCP HTTPS Load balancer is configured with SSL policy having TLS version 1.1 or lower

However, the alert count will return to the original numbers once the resources for *gcloud-compute-ssl-policies* start ingesting data again.
