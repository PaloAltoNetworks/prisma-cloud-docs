|DESCRIPTION


|*Recurring Reports for Cloud Security Assessment*
//RLP-88874

|To make sure that you are not missing anything important, you can now schedule a recurring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/generate-reports-on-prisma-cloud-alerts[Cloud Security Assessment Report] and keep track of the risks from open alerts in your monitored cloud accounts.

You can customize it to run on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis and pick an email template. Once you set it up, you can access all scheduled reports on "Alerts > Reports".

|*Credit Allocation for Usage*
//RLP-98261
|You can now distribute the credits you have purchased for the security features on Prisma Cloud amongst your teams. When you add a credit allocation rule (Settings > Licensing > Credit Allocation), you can provide the total number of credits for an account group, and define a usage threshold % at which you want to be notified. For example, if you set the threshold to 80% for 1000 credits, an alarm is generated when the usage is at 800 credits.

You can also monitor the credit usage on "Settings > Licensing > Credit Allocation" for a specified time range.

[#new-policies1]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and port scan activity*
//RLP-96281
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for port scan activities. Port scans are a type of discovery attack where a source host is probing a target host across multiple ports, to find out what services are running and to uncover vulnerabilities associated with those services. The network connectivity with remote systems known for port scan activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and ransomware activity*
//RLP-96279
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for ransomware activities. Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to regain access. The network connectivity with remote systems known for ransomware activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Azure VM instance in running state that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port*
//RLP-96676

|*Changes—* The policy name and the RQL is updated to report instance configured with HTTP (80) and HTTP (443) port and instance which are in active state only. 

*Current Name—* Azure VM instance in running state that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port
*Updated Name—* Azure Virtual Machine in running state that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)

*Updated Description—* Identifies azure VM instances in running state that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). VM instances with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/0:79', 'tcp/81:442', 'tcp/444:65535' ) and dest.resource.state = 'Active'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and dest.resource.state = 'Active'
----

*Impact—* Medium. New alerts will be generated when instance is exposed to internet and configured where HTTP / HTTPS port.

|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Master authorized networks disabled*
//RLP-89949
|*Changes—* The policy RQL is updated to reflect the latest CSP behavior.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and (masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.[*] is empty or masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled equals "false")
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled does not equal "true"
----

*Impact—* Medium. New alerts are generated for the failing resources. This includes resources where Master authorized networks were previously enabled but are now configured as disabled.

2+|*Policy Deletions*

|*GCP Policies*
//RLP-98183, RLP-98182, RLP-88162, RLP-88221
|The following policies are deleted because GCP has deprecated basic authentication, Kubernetes dashboard, and Istio for GKE.

* GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters Basic Authentication is set to Enabled
* GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters web UI/Dashboard is set to Enabled
* GCP Kubernetes cluster istioConfig not enabled

*Impact*— Low. Previously generated alerts are resolved as *Policy_Deleted*. The out-of-the-box compliance mappings for the above policies are removed and can affect the compliance score.
