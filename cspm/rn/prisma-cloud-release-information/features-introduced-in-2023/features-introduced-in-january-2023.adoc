|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Google Kubernetes Engine Container ClusterID Update*
//RLP-80880

|Beginning in the 23.1.2 release, the resource ID for the *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API in Prisma Cloud is updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts for these resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* APIs resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

|*Update to the Google VPC Network API*
//RLP-85372

|Beginning in the 23.1.1 release, Prisma Cloud will provide global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for the *gcloud-compute-networks-list API*. As a result, all resources for this API will be deleted once and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-networks-list* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original number.

|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)*

//RLP-84998
|Prisma Cloud now supports the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance standard.

In addition to improving the accuracy of corporate disclosures, SOX protects shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent business practices. Corporations must save all business records, including electronic records and electronic messages, for "not less than five years" to comply with SOX.
Non-compliance can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

|*CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v2.0.0 (Level 1 and Level 2)*

//RLP-89500
|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v2.0.0 is based on the CIS Google Cloud Computing Platform Foundations Benchmark v1.0.0 published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The CIS benchmark provides guidance to securing the GCP environment, covering everything from network to servers to operating systems. The important sections covered in the benchmark include IAM, Logging and monitoring configuration, Virtual Network Security settings, and Kubernetes Engine configuration.

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.  

|*CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.3.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2)*

//RLP-89501
|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.3.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2) is a set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security posture. Benchmarks are tied to specific Kubernetes releases. The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is written for the open source Kubernetes distribution and is intended to be universally applicable. Based on the existing CIS Benchmark, this standard adds additional controls that are Google Cloud-specific. 

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.

|DESCRIPTION

|*Cloud Account Onboarding for More Security Coverage*
//RLP-87499
|Prisma Cloud provides an improved and simplified onboarding experience by providing you with the option to select which security capabilities you want and by creating the role with the permissions required for those capabilities. You can now enable *Agentless Workload Scanning*, *Serverless Function Scanning*, *Agent Based Workload Protection*, *Data Security*, and *Remediation* capabilities as part of the new onboarding workflow for your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/add-aws-organization-to-prisma-cloud[AWS], https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/add-azure-cloud-account-on-prisma-cloud[Azure], and GCP cloud accounts using minimal steps.

* After you successfully onboard your cloud account on Prisma Cloud, by default, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans.

* The option to enable Data Security is now part of the onboarding workflow and is only available for AWS and Azure cloud accounts.

image::onboard-sec-perms-1.png[scale=20]

* For previously onboarded cloud accounts, when you *Edit* the account and enable or disable the additional security capabilities, the permissions for the Prisma Cloud role are updated. You must download the CFT again and apply it on the Cloud Service Provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) to apply the latest changes.

image::onboard-sec-perms-2.png[scale=20]

Depending on the capabilities you’ve enabled, make sure to follow the steps to configure https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/configure/configure-agentless-scanning[Agentless Workload Scanning], https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[Serverless Function Scanning], and Agent Based Workload Protection.


|*Adoption Advisor for Code to Cloud*
//RLP-69022
|To assist you in the process of monitoring and securing your cloud resources, the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/adoption-advisor[Adoption Advisor] has been updated to provide guidance on foundational, intermediate, and advanced tasks throughout the application lifecycle. The Adoption Advisor includes three stages of the code to cloud application lifecycle: Code & Build, Deploy, and Runtime. You can follow these stages at your own pace, using the "walk, crawl, run" principles to gradually adopt various security capabilities.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Azure AD Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is enabled*
//RLP-84177

|*Changes—* The policy RQL and recommendation steps have been updated according to the CSP changes. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = permissionGrantPolicyIdsAssignedToDefaultUserRole[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = defaultUserRolePermissions.permissionGrantPoliciesAssigned[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Impact—* Low. Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

|*SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured*
//RLP-84336

|*Changes—* The policy Name, Description, and Recommendation steps have been updated to maintain consistency across policies. The RQL has been updated with a new RQL grammar that will improve the accuracy of the results.

*Current Policy Name—* SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure SQL server not configured with Active Directory admin authentication

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Azure SQL servers that are not configured with Active Directory admin authentication. Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, you can centrally manage the identities of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location. As a best practice, configure SQL servers with Active Directory admin authentication. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '$.serverAdmins !exists or $.serverAdmins[] size equals 0 or ($.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType exists and $.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and $.serverAdmins[].properties.login is not empty)'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = serverAdmins does not exist or serverAdmins[*] size equals 0 or (serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType exists and serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and serverAdmins[*].properties.login is not empty)
----

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-85282

|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to ignore the case sensitive of the parameter value.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name is not member of ("GatewaySubnet", "AzureFirewallSubnet") and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Impact—* Low. Previous generated alert for gateway subnets where the name is not as GatewaySubnet will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

2+|*Policy Deletions*

|*AWS Policies*
//RLP-80432 and RLP-87246

|*Changes—* The following policies are deleted because the API used in it does not ingest the required fields. This policy validates the availability limit for the Subnet and Security group, which is not a security misconfiguration:

* AWS VPC Subnets nearing availability limit
* AWS VPC Security group nearing availability limit

*Impact—* No impact on alerts. The compliance mapping for the above policy is removed due to which the compliance score can get affected. The affected compliance standards are:

[#changes-in-existing-behavior]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Monitor and Protect renamed Remediation*

|With the Cloud Account Onboarding changes for more Security Coverage, the *Monitor* and *Monitor & Protect* modes are revised. For an existing account that was onboarded with *Monitor & Protect* mode, the *Remediation* security capability represents the mode. 

image::onboard-old-monitor-protect.png[scale=20]

These modes are no longer available when onboarding new cloud accounts. For the new workflow, see *Cloud Account Onboarding for More Security Coverage*. 

image::onboard-sec-perms-remediation.png[scale=20]

|tt:[Update] *AWS Account Onboarding*

|During onboarding your AWS cloud account on Prsima Cloud, if you are already logged in to your AWS management console, you can either *Download IAM Role CFT* or *Create IAM Role* on the fly.

image::aws-create-iam-role-1.png[scale=20]

When you click *Create IAM Role*, Prisma Cloud creates a dynamic link that takes you directly to the *Quick create stack* page in the AWS management console. You do not need to enter the template details manually in order to create the stack, it is auto-populated  based on the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* you’ve selected. 

image::aws-quick-create-stack-1.png[scale=20]

|*Google BigQuery API Resource ID Update*
//RLP-80884

|The resource ID for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* in Prisma Cloud is updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources is resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.


|*Enabling GCP APIs at Source Project*
//RLP-86121

|You must enable the following GCP APIs for each project that the service account accesses to allow monitoring and protection using Prisma Cloud:

* screen:[bigtableadmin.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[container.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[logging.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[monitoring.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[pubsub.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[serviceusage.googleapis.com] 
* screen:[firebaserules.googleapis.com]

*Impact*—No impact on alerts.
