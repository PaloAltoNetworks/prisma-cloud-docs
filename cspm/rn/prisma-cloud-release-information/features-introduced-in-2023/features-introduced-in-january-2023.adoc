|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Ingest Audit Logs using Amazon EventBridge*
//RLP-78526

|Till now Prisma Cloud would make API calls to AWS CloudTrail service to fetch audit logs (change events). Prisma Cloud now uses EventBridge to support event assisted ingestion to move from the pull method to a push method that triggers ingestion when changes are made on your resources.

Event assisted ingestion is an enhancement intended to reduce the number of API calls and to make the API call only if the resource configuration is changed. Prisma Cloud will listen to any changes on the supported resources and call the corresponding API to sync the details for the resource.

|tt:[GA] *Recurring Reports for Adoption Advisor*
//RLP-67981
|You can now schedule a recurring Adoption Advisor Report to receive a summary of your adoption and improvements on our cloud security posture at regular cadence. You can schedule the report to run on a daily, weekly, or monthly intervals, and view a list of all scheduled reports under *Adoption Advisor > Reports*.

|

|*Support for AWS IAM Identity Center*
//RLP-88304

|Prisma Cloud now integrates with AWS IAM Identity Center, providing you complete visibility into the access privileges of users currently using AWS IAM Identity Center to log into AWS, including users and groups created in or imported into Identity Center. You can also create access policies, user alerts and remediate risky permissions for AWS IAM Identity Center users. Navigate to *Settings > Integrate > Add Integration* and select *AWS IAM Identity Center* in the *Integration Type* drop-down to get started.

|*JSON Responses of RQL Queries Updated*
//RLP-81848

|The AWS search service now uses the open source project, OpenSearch, instead of Elasticsearch and Kibana. This impacts two attributes in the JSON response of some RQL queries:
* The instance type attribute is "Search" instead of "AWS Elasticsearch".
* The version attribute is "Elasticsearch_1.5" instead of "1.5".

|*Azure Storage Account 'Trusted Microsoft Services' access not enabled*
//RLP-86542

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Storage Accounts which have 'Trusted Microsoft Services' access not enabled. Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. If the Allow trusted Microsoft services exception is enabled, the following services: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Networking, Azure Monitor and Azure SQL Data Warehouse (when registered in the subscription), are granted access to the storage account. It is recommended to enable Trusted Microsoft Services on storage account instead of leveraging network rules.

=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Google Kubernetes Engine Container ClusterID Update*
//RLP-80880

|The resource ID for the *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API in Prisma Cloud is updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts for these resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* APIs resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

|*Google VPC Network API Update*
//RLP-85372

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for the *gcloud-compute-networks-list API*. As a result, all resources for this API will be deleted once and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-networks-list* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)*

//RLP-85048
|Prisma Cloud now supports the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance standard.

In addition to improving the accuracy of corporate disclosures, SOX protects shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent business practices. Corporations must save all business records, including electronic records and electronic messages, for "not less than five years" to comply with SOX.
Non-compliance can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

|*CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v2.0.0 (Level 1 and Level 2)*

//RLP-89500
|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v2.0.0 is based on the CIS Google Cloud Computing Platform Foundations Benchmark v1.0.0 published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The CIS benchmark provides guidance to securing the GCP environment, covering everything from network to servers to operating systems. The important sections covered in the benchmark include IAM, Logging and monitoring configuration, Virtual Network Security settings, and Kubernetes Engine configuration.

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.  

|*CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.3.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2)*

//RLP-89501
|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.3.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2) is a set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security posture. Benchmarks are tied to specific Kubernetes releases. The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is written for the open source Kubernetes distribution and is intended to be universally applicable. Based on the existing CIS Benchmark, this standard adds additional controls that are Google Cloud-specific. 

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Cloud Account Onboarding for More Security Coverage*
//RLP-87499
|Prisma Cloud provides an improved and simplified onboarding experience by providing you with the option to select which security capabilities you want and by creating the role with the permissions required for those capabilities. You can now enable *Agentless Workload Scanning*, *Serverless Function Scanning*, *Agent Based Workload Protection*, *Data Security*, and *Remediation* capabilities as part of the new onboarding workflow for your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/add-aws-organization-to-prisma-cloud[AWS], https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account/add-azure-cloud-account-on-prisma-cloud[Azure], and GCP cloud accounts using minimal steps.

* After you successfully onboard your cloud account on Prisma Cloud, by default, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans.

* The option to enable Data Security is now part of the onboarding workflow and is only available for AWS and Azure cloud accounts.

image::onboard-sec-perms-1.png[scale=20]

* For previously onboarded cloud accounts, when you *Edit* the account and enable or disable the additional security capabilities, the permissions for the Prisma Cloud role are updated. You must download the CFT again and apply it on the Cloud Service Provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) to apply the latest changes.

image::onboard-sec-perms-2.png[scale=20]

Depending on the capabilities you’ve enabled, make sure to follow the steps to configure https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/configure/configure-agentless-scanning[Agentless Workload Scanning], https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[Serverless Function Scanning], and Agent Based Workload Protection.


|*Adoption Advisor for Code to Cloud*

|*Changes—* The policy Name, Description, and Recommendation steps have been updated to maintain consistency across policies. The RQL has been updated with a new RQL grammar that will improve the accuracy of the results.

*Current Policy Name—* SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure SQL server not configured with Active Directory admin authentication

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Azure SQL servers that are not configured with Active Directory admin authentication. Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, you can centrally manage the identities of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location. As a best practice, configure SQL servers with Active Directory admin authentication. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '$.serverAdmins !exists or $.serverAdmins[] size equals 0 or ($.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType exists and $.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and $.serverAdmins[].properties.login is not empty)'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = serverAdmins does not exist or serverAdmins[*] size equals 0 or (serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType exists and serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and serverAdmins[*].properties.login is not empty)
----

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-85282

|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to ignore the case sensitive of the parameter value.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name is not member of ("GatewaySubnet", "AzureFirewallSubnet") and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Impact—* Low. Previous generated alert for gateway subnets where the name is not as GatewaySubnet will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

//RLP-80432 and RLP-87246

|*Changes—* The following policies are deleted because the API used in it does not ingest the required fields. This policy validates the availability limit for the Subnet and Security group, which is not a security misconfiguration:

* AWS VPC Subnets nearing availability limit
* AWS VPC Security group nearing availability limit

*Impact—* No impact on alerts. The compliance mapping for the above policy is removed due to which the compliance score can get affected. The affected compliance standards are:

NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2, PCI DSS v3.2.1, Copy of APRA (CPS 234) Information Security, NIST SP 800-172, Copy of 1Copy of Brazilian Data Protection Law (LGPD), HITRUST v.9.4.2, ACSC Information Security Manual (ISM), NIST CSF, TestCompliance, Copy of Brazilian Data Protection Law (LGPD), MAS TRM 2021, ISO/IEC 27002:2013, ISO/IEC 27017:2015, MLPS 2.0 (Level 2), CIS Controls v8, CIS Controls v7.1, HITRUST CSF v.9.6.0, Secure Controls Framework (SCF) - 2022.2.1, APRA (CPS 234) Information Security, Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) v.1.02, Brazilian Data Protection Law (LGPD), CSA CCM v.4.0.1, ISO/IEC 27018:2019


|*AWS EC2 instance is not configured with VPC*
//RLP-84346 and RLP-87246

|*Changes—* AWS has deprecated the AWS classic network service. As a result, this policy is now obsolete and is deleted.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts. The compliance mapping for the above policy is removed due to which the compliance score can get affected. The affected compliance standards are:

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Monitor and Protect renamed Remediation*

|With the Cloud Account Onboarding changes for more Security Coverage, the *Monitor* and *Monitor & Protect* modes are revised. For an existing account that was onboarded with *Monitor & Protect* mode, the *Remediation* security capability represents the mode. 

image::onboard-old-monitor-protect.png[scale=20]

These modes are no longer available when onboarding new cloud accounts. For the new workflow, see *Cloud Account Onboarding for More Security Coverage*.

|tt:[Update] *AWS Account Onboarding*

|During onboarding your AWS cloud account on Prsima Cloud, if you are already logged in to your AWS management console, you can either *Download IAM Role CFT* or *Create IAM Role* on the fly.

image::aws-create-iam-role-1.png[scale=20]

When you click *Create IAM Role*, Prisma Cloud creates a dynamic link that takes you directly to the *Quick create stack* page in the AWS management console. You do not need to enter the template details manually in order to create the stack, it is auto-populated  based on the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* you’ve selected.

|*Google BigQuery API Resource ID Update*
//RLP-80884

|The resource ID for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* in Prisma Cloud is updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources is resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.


|*Near Zero Rate Limit Exception for GCP APIs*
//RLP-86121

|You must enable the following GCP APIs for each project that the Prisma Cloud service account accesses to monitor and protect your GCP resources. If you have onboarded your GCP account at the Organization level, this configuration ensures that the API rate limit quota is applied to each GCP project that is part of the onboarded GCP Organization, and not counted entirely towards the project where the service account is created.
