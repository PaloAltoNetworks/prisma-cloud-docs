|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Azure AD Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is enabled*
//RLP-84177

|*Changes—* The policy RQL and recommendation steps have been updated according to the CSP changes. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = permissionGrantPolicyIdsAssignedToDefaultUserRole[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = defaultUserRolePermissions.permissionGrantPoliciesAssigned[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Impact—* Low. Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

|*SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured*
//RLP-84336

|*Changes—* The policy Name, Description, and Recommendation steps have been updated to maintain consistency across policies. The RQL has been updated with a new RQL grammar that will improve the accuracy of the results.

*Current Policy Name—* SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure SQL server not configured with Active Directory admin authentication

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Azure SQL servers that are not configured with Active Directory admin authentication. Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, you can centrally manage the identities of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location. As a best practice, configure SQL servers with Active Directory admin authentication. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '$.serverAdmins !exists or $.serverAdmins[] size equals 0 or ($.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType exists and $.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and $.serverAdmins[].properties.login is not empty)'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = serverAdmins does not exist or serverAdmins[*] size equals 0 or (serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType exists and serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and serverAdmins[*].properties.login is not empty)
----

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-85282

|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to ignore the case sensitive of the parameter value.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name is not member of ("GatewaySubnet", "AzureFirewallSubnet") and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Impact—* Low. Previous generated alert for gateway subnets where the name is not as GatewaySubnet will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*
