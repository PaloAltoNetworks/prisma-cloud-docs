|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Azure SQL on Virtual Machine (Linux) with basic authentication*
//RLP-104615
| Identifies Azure Virtual Machines that are hosted with SQL on them and have basic authentication.

Azure Virtual Machines with basic authentication could allow attackers to brute force and gain access to SQL database hosted on it, which might lead to sensitive information leakage. It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication to avoid brute force attacks on SQL database hosted virtual machines.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-vm-list' AND json.rule = powerState equal ignore case "PowerState/running" and ['properties.storageProfile'].['imageReference'].['publisher'] equal ignore case microsoftsqlserver and (['properties.osProfile'].['linuxConfiguration'] exists and ['properties.osProfile'].['linuxConfiguration'].['disablePasswordAuthentication'] is false)
----

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Low 

|*AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk*
//RLP-94198
|Identifies AWS Route53 Hosted Zones which have dangling DNS records with subdomain takeover risk. A Route53 Hosted Zone having a CNAME entry pointing to a non-existing S3 bucket will have a risk of these dangling domain entries being taken over by an attacker by creating a similar S3 bucket in any AWS account which the attacker owns / controls. Attackers can use this domain to do phishing attacks, spread malware and other illegal activities. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete dangling DNS records entry from your AWS Route 53 hosted zones.

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-route53-list-hosted-zones' AND json.rule = hostedZone.config.privateZone is false and resourceRecordSet[?any( type equals CNAME and resourceRecords[*].value contains s3-website )] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' as Y; filter 'not ($.X.resourceRecordSet[*].name intersects $.Y.bucketName)'; show X;

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is not using the latest predefined security policy*
//RLP-102409

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated. The policy RQL has been updated to check for the latest security policy userinput:[ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06] 

*Updated Description—* Identifies Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. So it is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.

We recommend using ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06 policy to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.

*Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = type equals application and listeners[?any(protocol equals HTTPS and sslPolicy exists and (sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2020-10 and sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06))] exists

----

*Impact—* Medium. New alerts will be generated in case ALB is not configured to use the latest security policy. Existing alerts for resources that are already using the latest security policy are resolved as *Policy_updated*.


|*AWS EC2 instance that is reachable from untrust internet source to ports with high risk*
//RLP-104593

|*Changes—* Policy RQL is updated to check and report EC2 instance which are in active state.

*Severity—* High

|*Azure SQL Server ADS Vulnerability Assessment is disabled*
//RLP-101283

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated. The policy RQL has been updated according to new express configuration to check if ADS vulnerability assessment is disabled. 

*Updated Decsription—* Identifies Azure SQL Server which has ADS Vulnerability Assessment setting disabled. Advanced Data Security - Vulnerability Assessment service scans SQL databases for known security vulnerabilities and highlight deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data. It is recommended to enable ADS - VA service.


*Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = vulnerabilityAssessments[*].properties.storageContainerPath does not exist
