[#new-policies1]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and malware activity*
//RLP-96222
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for malware activities. Malware includes viruses, trojans, worms and other types of malware that affect the popular open-source operating system. The network connectivity with remote systems known for malware activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and botnet activity*
//RLP-96219
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for botnet activities. A Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The network connectivity with remote systems known for botnet activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and cryptominer activity*
//RLP-96024
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for cryptominer activities. Cryptominer hides on computers or mobile devices to surreptitiously use the machine’s resources to mine cryptocurrencies. The network connectivity with remote systems known for cryptominer activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and backdoor activity*
//RLP-96023
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for backdoor activities. A backdoor allows unauthorized remote access to the instances where the malware is installed while bypassing the authentication mechanisms in place. The network connectivity with remote systems known for backdoor activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

[#policy-updates1]
=== Policy Updates

No Policy Updates for 23.4.1.

[#new-compliance-benchmarks-and-updates1]
=== New Compliance Benchmarks and Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Support for ISO/IEC 27001:2022*

//RLP-96841
|Prisma Cloud now supports the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliance standard.

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 provides guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices, including the selection, implementation, and management of controls while taking the organization's information security risk environment into account.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior1]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Changes to Policy Severity Level* tt:[First announced in 23.2.1]
//RLP-90803, RLP-97339

|Prisma Cloud updated the system default policies to help you identify critical alerts and address them effectively. The policy severity levels for some system default policies are re-aligned to use the newly introduced *Critical* and *Informational* severities. Due to this change, the policies have five levels of severity; Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational. You can prioritize critical alerts first and then move on to the other levels. For more information, see the updated https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/policy-severity-level-changes.csv[list of policies].

*Impact—* 

* Your existing open alerts associated with updated policies will have a change in their severity levels.
* If you have Alert rules set up based on the *Policy Severity* filter, there may be a decrease or increase in the number of alerts.
* The overall Compliance posture may change due to possible alert number changes.
* If you have alert rules configured for external integrations such as ServiceNow, this shift in the number of alerts may result in sending notifications for the Resolved or Open alerts.
* If you change a custom severity of a policy back to the default severity, the new severity update will apply.

[NOTE]
====
This update will not affect the severities of your custom policies or the system default policies for which you have manually changed the severities (custom severity). 
Also, if you have included a policy in at least one other alert rule userinput:[(not based on severity filter)], there will be no change in the alert numbers.
====

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Update for Google Compute APIs*
//RLP-95461

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for *gcloud-compute-url-maps*, *gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies*, and *gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies* APIs. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-url-maps*, *gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies*, and *gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.
