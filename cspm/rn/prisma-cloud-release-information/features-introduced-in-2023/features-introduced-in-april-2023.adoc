|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Support for Azure Tags on Prisma Cloud IAM*
//RLP-95202

|Prisma Cloud IAM now leverages Azure Permission levels https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/context-used-to-calculate-effective-permissions[Context Used to Calculate Effective Permissions] for better visibility into your Azure identity permissions, providing you with a more granular view of granted permissions. In addition, you can use these new attributes to create custom policies to more closely monitor your cloud resources.

|tt:[Enahancement] *OCI Terraform File Update*
//RLP-86137
|Prisma Cloud now supports over 100 IAM policy statements without requiring a service limit increase from OCI. With this change, you must update your existing Terraform file to enable read permissions for all the supported services necessary for an OCI tenant on Prisma Cloud.

[#new-policies1]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and malware activity*
//RLP-96222
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for malware activities. Malware Includes viruses, trojans, worms and other types of malware that affect the popular open-source operating system. The network connectivity with remote systems known for malware activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and botnet activity*
//RLP-96219
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for botnet activities. A Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The network connectivity with remote systems known for botnet activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and cryptominer activity*
//RLP-96024
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for cryptominer activities. Cryptominer hides on computers or mobile devices to surreptitiously use the machine’s resources to mine cryptocurrencies. The network connectivity with remote systems known for cryptominer activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and backdoor activity*
//RLP-96023
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for backdoor activities. A backdoor allows unauthorized remote access to the instances where the malware is installed while bypassing the authentication mechanisms in place. The network connectivity with remote systems known for backdoor activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

[#policy-updates1]
=== Policy Updates

No Policy Updates for 23.4.1.

[#new-compliance-benchmarks-and-updates2]
=== New Compliance Benchmarks and Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Support for ISO/IEC 27001:2022*

//RLP-96841
|Prisma Cloud now supports the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliance standard.

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 provides guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices, including the selection, implementation, and management of controls while taking the organization's information security risk environment into account.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior1]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Changes to Policy Severity Level* tt:[First announced in 23.2.1]
//RLP-90803, RLP-97339

|Prisma Cloud updated the system default policies to help you identify critical alerts and address them effectively. The policies are now modified to have five levels of severity, namely Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational. You can prioritize critical alerts first and then move on to the other levels. For more information, see the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/policy-severity-level-changes.csv[list of policies] that are affected.

*Impact—* You may see:

* Changes in the severity of existing alerts
* Changes in your overall compliance status due to the modified severity of alerts
* Decrease or increase in the number of alerts, based on how your alert rules are set up according to the *Policy Severity* filter
* If you have configured your alert rules to send notifications to external integrations such as ServiceNow, this shift in the number of alerts may result in sending notifications for the modified alert.

[NOTE]
====
The severity of a few policies has been changed to maintain uniformity since the initial notice of this update.
====

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.


|*Update for Google Compute APIs*
//RLP-95461

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for *gcloud-compute-url-maps*, *gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies*, and *gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies* APIs. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-url-maps*, *gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies*, and *gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.
