|*FEATURE*
|*DESCRIPTION*

|tt:[Enhancement] *Role Assignment Modification for SSO Sign-In*
//RLP-79486

|If you have enabled access to users on Prisma Cloud using SSO with JIT provisioning, you can no longer modify their roles in the Prisma Cloud administrative console, unless they have previously been added to an SSO bypass list. The role management for these users needs to be completed from the Identity Provider (IdP) for the change to take effect.
 
[NOTE]
====
 Users on the SSO bypass list can modify their roles and login directly to the Prisma Cloud console using credentials. However, once you opt to sign-in using SSO, your role will get reset to the IdP provisioned role.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Asset Class Filter*
//RLP-90184

|An Asset Class is an an asset attribute that aligns with the generally intended application of a given asset type. The new *Asset Class* filter is available on the *Asset Inventory* and *Alerts Overview* page that allows you to filter assets based on the following asset classes:

* Code
* Compute
* Database
* Identity and Security
* Network
* Other
* Storage

When you use this filter, the results on the Prisma Cloud console are narrowed to display the list of assets that match your criterion.

|*Performance Improvements for Investigate RQL Queries*
//RLP-68326, PCSUP-12909
|The userinput:[config] and userinput:[event] query results on the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/config-query/config-query-attributes#id192IG0J098M[*Investigate*] page are optimized to load the initial set of results significantly faster. To enable faster load times, the backend automatically uses a heuristic search to retrieve search results for your query.
When you enter the query and click *Search*, the interface loads the first 100 search results, and you can use the *Load More* button to fetch more results. The *Get Total Count* button enables you to get a full count of all pertinent results, and is available for eligible queries that include attributes that support the heuristic search only.

All userinput:[config] attributes *except* cloud.accountgroup, azure.resource.group, limit search records, aggregate functions (count and group by), and all finding type attributes such as finding.type, finding.severity, are currently optimized for faster search results. For event queries, the attribute cloud type supports heuristic search.


|*API Access Key Expiration Notifications*
//RLP-77986

|Prisma Cloud allows you to create and manage API keys to facilitate programmatic access to our features and functionality. To ensure uninterrupted access to Prisma Cloud APIs, you can now set up the following Access Key Expiration Notifications:

* Email notifications for named user Access Keys
* Alarm Center notifications for Service Account Access Keys

Navigate to "Enterprise Settings > Access Key Expiration Notifications" to set a notification threshold prior to access key expiration.

[NOTE]
====
Updates to Access Key Expiration Notifications settings may take up to 24 hours to take effect.
====


|*Support for AWS Tags on Prisma Cloud IAM*
//RLP-88307

|Prisma Cloud IAM now supports https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/context-used-to-calculate-effective-permissions[AWS tags]. Leverage tags to create RQL queries and dynamic custom policies, by using specific tags to group your cloud resources, roles, groups, policies, etc. when defining your alert rules.

|*Send Audit Logs to External Integrations*
//RLP-40400, RLP-82355, RLP-84161
|Forward audit logs from Prisma Cloud to an external integration that you have configured to integrate with your existing security workflows.

* Select "Settings > Enterprise Settings".
* Enable, *Send Audit Logs to integration*.
* Select the AWS SQS or Webhooks notification channel to send the audit logs.
+
All new audit logs that are generated after you enable the integration will be sent to this channel. You can view the audit logs on "Settings > Audit Logs" on Prisma Cloud.

image::forward-audit-logs.gif[scale=100]

[NOTE]
====
Prisma Cloud does not forward *Successful Login* type audit log messages to external integrations to minimize noise and log flooding. However, all other audit log types can be forwarded to any supported external integration such as Webhook or SQS. For example, Prisma Cloud does not forward the following audit log message.
----
'xxx@paloaltonetworks.com'(with role 'System Admin':'System Admin') logged in via password
---- 
====


|*Support for Azure Permission Levels on Prisma Cloud IAM*
//RLP-88309

|Prisma Cloud IAM now leverages https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/context-used-to-calculate-effective-permissions[Azure Permission levels] for better visibility into your Azure identity permissions, providing you with a more granular view of granted permissions. In addition, you can use these new attributes to create custom policies to more closely monitor your cloud resources.


|tt:[Update] *IAM Query Attributes*
//RLP-92082

|The new screen:[CONTAINS ALL] operator is now supported for the userinput:[action.name] attribute. With this https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/iam-query/iam-query-attributes[operator], you can run queries with AND logic in between values. For example, if you want to get only roles that contain all actions: X, Y, and Z:

----
config from iam where action.name CONTAINS ALL ( 'Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform/farmBeats/seasons/write', 'Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform/fields/delete' )
----

Use this operator to more granularly query groups, roles, and policies.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Activity Log Retention should not be set to less than 365 days*
//RLP-87612

|*Changes—* The policy name, description,and recommendations are updated according to the latest vendor UI settings.The policy RQL is updated to check log profile status so that disabled log profiles will be reported. 

*Current Name—* Activity Log Retention should not be set to less than 365 days
*Updated Name—* Azure Activity Log retention should not be set to less than 365 days

*Updated Description—* Identifies Log profiles which have log retention set to less than 365 days. Log profile controls how your Activity Log is exported and retained. Since the average time to detect a breach is over 200 days, it is recommended to retain your activity log for 365 days or more in order to have time to respond to any incidents.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND cloud.service = 'Azure Monitor' AND api.name = 'azure-monitor-log-profiles-list' AND json.rule = 'isLegacy is true and (properties.retentionPolicy !exists or (properties.retentionPolicy.days != 0 and properties.retentionPolicy.days < 365))'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-monitor-log-profiles-list' AND json.rule = isLegacy is true and (properties.retentionPolicy does not exist or properties.retentionPolicy.enabled is false or (properties.retentionPolicy.enabled is true and (properties.retentionPolicy.days does not equal 0 and properties.retentionPolicy.days < 365)))
----

*Impact—* Low. New alerts will be generated for disabled log profiles.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Global Region Support for Google VPC Firewall Rule*
//RLP-90294

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support for *gcloud-compute-firewall-rules-list*. Due to this, all the resources will be deleted, and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to this resource are resolved as Resource_Deleted, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

|*Google VPC Network API Update*
//RLP-85372

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for the *gcloud-compute-networks-list API*. As a result, all resources for this API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-networks-list* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.
