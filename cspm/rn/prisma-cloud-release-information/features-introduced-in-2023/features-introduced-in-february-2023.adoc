|DESCRIPTION

|*Asset Class Filter*
//RLP-90184

|An Asset Class is an an asset attribute that aligns with the generally intended application of a given asset type. The new *Asset Class* filter is available on the Asset Inventory and Alerts Overview page that allows you to filter assets based on the following asset classes:A new *Asset Class* filter is available on the Alerts Overview page that allows you to filter alerts based on the following asset classes supported in Prisma Cloud:

* Code
* Compute
* Database
* Identity and Security
* Network
* Other

|*Performance Improvements for Investigate RQL Queries*
//RLP-68326, PCSUP-12909
|The userinput:[config] and userinput:[event] query results on the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/config-query/config-query-attributes#id192IG0J098M[*Investigate*] page are optimized to load the initial set of results significantly faster. To enable faster load times, the backend automatically uses a heuristic search to retrieve search results for your query.
When you enter the query and click *Search*, the interface loads the first 100 search results, and you can use the *Load More* button to fetch more results. The *Get Total Count* button enables you to get a full count of all pertinent results, and is available for eligible queries that include attributes that support the heuristic search only.

All userinput:[config] attributes *except* cloud.accountgroup, azure.resource.group, limit search records, aggregate functions (count and group by), and all finding type attributes such as finding.type, finding.severity, are currently optimized for faster search results. For event queries, the attribute cloud type supports heuristic search.

|*API Access Key Expiration Notifications*
//RLP-91133

|Prisma Cloud allows you to create and manage API keys to facilitate programmatic access to our features and functionality. To ensure uninterrupted access to Prisma Cloud APIs, you can now set up the following Access Key Expiration Notifications:

- Email notifications for named user Access Keys
- Alarm Center notifications for Service Account Access Keys
 
Navigate to *Enterprise Settings > Access Key Expiration Notifications* to set a notification threshold prior to access key expiration. 

[NOTE]
====
Updates to Access Key Expiration Notifications settings may take up to 24 hours to take effect.
====

|*Support for AWS Tags on Prisma Cloud IAM*
//RLP-88307

|Prisma Cloud IAM now supports https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/context-used-to-calculate-effective-permissions[AWS tags]. Leverage tags to create RQL queries and dynamic custom policies, by using specific tags to group your cloud resources, roles, groups, policies, etc. when defining your alert rules.

|*Send Audit Logs to External Integrations*
//RLP-40400, RLP-82355, RLP-84161
|Forward audit logs from Prisma Cloud to an external integration that you have configured to integrate with your existing security workflows.

* Select "Settings > Enterprise Settings".
* Enable, *Send Audit Logs to integration*.
* Select the AWS SQS or Webhooks notification channel to send the audit logs.
+
All new audit logs that are generated after you enable the integration will be sent to this channel. You can view the audit logs on "Settings > Audit Logs" on Prisma Cloud.

image::forward-audit-logs.gif[scale=100]

[NOTE]
====
Prisma Cloud does not forward *Successful Login* type audit log messages to external integrations to minimize noise and log flooding. However, all other audit log types can be forwarded to any supported external integration such as Webhook or SQS. For example, Prisma Cloud does not forward the following audit log message.
----
'xxx@paloaltonetworks.com'(with role 'System Admin':'System Admin') logged in via password
---- 
====


|*Support for Azure Permission Levels on Prisma Cloud IAM*
//RLP-88309

|Prisma Cloud IAM now leverages https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/context-used-to-calculate-effective-permissions[Azure Permission levels] for better visibility into your Azure identity permissions, providing you with a more granular view of granted permissions. In addition, you can use these new attributes to create custom policies to more closely monitor your cloud resources.


|tt:[Update] *IAM Query Attributes*
//RLP-92082

|The new screen:[CONTAINS ALL] operator is now supported for the userinput:[action.name] attribute. With this https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-rql-reference/rql-reference/iam-query/iam-query-attributes[operator], you can run queries with AND logic in between values. For example, if you want to get only roles that contain all actions: X, Y, and Z:

----
config from iam where action.name CONTAINS ALL ( 'Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform/farmBeats/seasons/write', 'Microsoft.AgFoodPlatform/fields/delete' )
----

Use this operator to more granularly query groups, roles, and policies.

|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS SSM documents are public*

+++<draft-comment>RLP-84319</draft-comment>+++
|Identifies list of SSM documents that are public and might allow unintended access. A public SSM document can expose valuable information about your account, resources, and internal processes. It is recommended to only share SSM documents to only few private AWS accounts based on the requirement.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-ssm-document' AND json.rule = accountSharingInfoList[*].accountId equal ignore case "all"
----

|*AWS CloudFront distributions does not have a default root object configured*
//RLP-84284

|Identifies list of CloudFront distributions which does not have default root object configured. If a CloudFront distribution does not have a default root object configured, requests for the root of your distribution pass to your origin server which might return a list of the private contents of your origin. To avoid exposing the contents of your distribution or returning an error it is recommended to specify a default root object.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-cloudfront-list-distributions' AND json.rule = defaultRootObject is empty
----

|*Azure Storage account is not configured with private endpoint connection*
//RLP-76252

|Identifies Storage accounts that are not configured with a private endpoint connection. Azure Storage account private endpoints can be configured using Azure Private Link. Private Link allows users to access an Azure Storage account from within the virtual network or from any peered virtual network. When Private Link is combined with restricted NSG policies, it helps reduce the risk of data exfiltration. It is recommended to configure Private Endpoint Connection to Storage account.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and networkRuleSet.defaultAction equal ignore case Allow and networkRuleSet.virtualNetworkRules is empty and networkRuleSet.ipRules[*] is empty and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty
----

|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud set to Off for Resource Manager*
//RLP-76226

|Identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud which has defender setting for Resource Manager (ARM) set to Off. Enabling Azure Defender for ARM provides protection against issues like Suspicious resource management operations, Use of exploitation toolkits, Lateral movement from the Azure management layer to the Azure resources data plane. It is highly recommended to enable Azure Defender for ARM.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-security-center-settings' AND json.rule = pricings[?any(name equal ignore case Arm and properties.pricingTier does not equal ignore case Standard)] exists
----

|*GCP SQL server instance database flag 3625 (trace flag) is not set to on*
//RLP-39930

|Identifies GCP SQL server instance for which database flag 3625 (trace flag) is not set to on. Trace flag can help prevent the disclosure of sensitive information by masking the parameters of some error messages using '*', for users who are not members of the sysadmin fixed server role. It is recommended to set 3625 (trace flag) database flag for SQL Server instance to on.

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-sql-instances-list' AND json.rule = "databaseVersion contains SQLSERVER and state equals RUNNABLE and (settings.databaseFlags[*].name does not contain 3625 or settings.databaseFlags[?any(name contains 3625 and value contains off)] exists)"

|*Activity Log Retention should not be set to less than 365 days*
//RLP-87612

|*Changes—* The policy name, description,and recommendations are updated according to the latest vendor UI settings.The policy RQL is updated to check log profile status so that disabled log profiles will be reported. 

*Current Name—* Activity Log Retention should not be set to less than 365 days
*Updated Name—* Azure Activity Log retention should not be set to less than 365 days

*Updated Description—* Identifies Log profiles which have log retention set to less than 365 days. Log profile controls how your Activity Log is exported and retained. Since the average time to detect a breach is over 200 days, it is recommended to retain your activity log for 365 days or more in order to have time to respond to any incidents.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND cloud.service = 'Azure Monitor' AND api.name = 'azure-monitor-log-profiles-list' AND json.rule = 'isLegacy is true and (properties.retentionPolicy !exists or (properties.retentionPolicy.days != 0 and properties.retentionPolicy.days < 365))'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-monitor-log-profiles-list' AND json.rule = isLegacy is true and (properties.retentionPolicy does not exist or properties.retentionPolicy.enabled is false or (properties.retentionPolicy.enabled is true and (properties.retentionPolicy.days does not equal 0 and properties.retentionPolicy.days < 365)))
----

*Impact—* Low. New alerts will be generated for disabled log profiles.
