|DESCRIPTION

|*Validate Secrets during a Secrets scan*
|During the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/secrets-scanning[secrets scan], Prisma Cloud now validates certain secrets against public APIs to see if the secret is still active. This allows you to prioritize secrets.
Validation is off by default, but can be turned on from *Settings > Code Security Configuration > Validate Secrets*.
You can access information on validation of secrets on *Projects > Secrets*, using *Resource Explorer* where prioritization of a valid secret is either to *Suppress* it or perform a *Manual Fix*. Alternatively you can run Checkov on your repositories to filter potentially exposed secrets.
