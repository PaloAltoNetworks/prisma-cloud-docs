|*New Configuration Build Policies*

|The following new build policy is available on Prisma Cloud Code Security module:

* Cleartext credentials over unencrypted channel should not be accepted for the operation
* GCP Firewall with Inbound rule overly permissive to All Traffic
* Rules used could create a double pipeline
* Detect images within GitLab CI workflows
* Container job does not use a non latest version tag
* Pipeline image version is referenced via an arbitrary tag
* Pipeline uses mutable development orbs
* Pipeline uses unversioned volatile orbs
* Pipeline uses netcat with an IP address
* Pipeline uses run command that is vulnerable to shell injection
* Pipeline uses curl in a suspicious way
* Detect images within circleCI workflows
* Container job does not use a non latest version tag
* Container job uses a version digest
* Set variable is marked as a secret"
* RoleBinding should not allow privilege escalation to a ServiceAccount or Node on other RoleBinding
* Granting `create` permissions to `nodes/proxy` or `pods/exec` sub resources allows potential privilege escalation
* No ServiceAccount/Node should have `impersonate` permissions for groups/users/service-accounts
* ServiceAccounts and nodes that can modify services/status may set the `status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip` field to exploit the unfixed CVE-2020-8554 and launch MiTM attacks against the cluster
* No ServiceAccount/Node should be able to read all secrets
* GitHub branch protection does not dismiss stale reviews
* GitHub branch protection does not restrict who can dismiss a PR
* GitHub branch protection does not require code owner reviews
* GitHub branch protection does not require status checks
* GitHub branch protection does not require conversation resolution
* GitHub branch protection does not require push restrictions
* GitHub branch protection rules allow branch deletions
