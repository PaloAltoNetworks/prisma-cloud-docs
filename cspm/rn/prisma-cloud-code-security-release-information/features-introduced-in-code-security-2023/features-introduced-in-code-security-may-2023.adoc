|DESCRIPTION

|*Code Security Dashboard*
|Code Security dashboard (*Dashboard > Code Security*) enables you to analyze error trends across code integrations on Prisma Cloud. While emphasizing on the critical and high severity code errors, the dashboard also  gives you an understanding of the potentially vulnerable vectors in repositories, policy errors including secrets, non-compliant package licenses, CVE vulnerabilities and IaC misconfigurations. See the historical trend for Code Issues and Pull Requests to make informed decisions to prevent the recurrence of the trend.
The vectors for repositories, policy errors, non-compliant package licenses, CVE vulnerabilities and IaC misconfigurations ensure you see the latest real time data after scans.
Each error count across vectors directs you to *Code Security > Projects* to see a contextual understanding of the error while remediating the errors if necessary.

|*Additional `Read` permissions for GitHub integration*
|The GitHub app is being updated to improve security coverage and visibility of your Git and CI/CD security posture. If you have set up the GitHub integration on Prisma Cloud Code Security, you will be prompted  to grant additional Read permissions to the application on GitHub.

Approving these permissions will enable you to use the enhanced capabilities that security teams can use to monitor and optimize their Git and CI/CD Security posture across the organization, when it becomes available.
