|DESCRIPTION

| *Custom Prisma Cloud Permission group for Code Security capabilities*
| As  a part of custom Prisma Cloud roles for Code Security, administrators can now define explicit permissions for Code Security workflows from  Permission Group *(Settings > Access Control > Add > Permission Group)*. In addition to the existing System Admin permission you can define roles for:

* View access Permissions: Provide view access for Code Security Configuration, Projects, Supply Chain and Development Pipelines pages.
* Repository permissions: Provide integrate, view, update and delete access to Repositories.

| *Enhancements to Audit Logs*
| In addition to the existing Audit Logs *(Settings > Audit Logs)*, you can now see a list of all actions initiated by Prisma Cloud administrators on Code Security. The actions on the Audit Logs help you identify any configuration changes and activities initiated on the repositories behalf of the administrator.
Here are the kind of actions you can track.

* *Suppression Management*: Creating or deleting a suppression rule for the default branch on Projects *(Code Security > Projects)*
* *Enforcement*: Adding a new Enforcement rule or reconfiguring an existing Enforcement rule by editing or deleting the rule. This also includes modifying the default thresholds of Enforcement parameters.
* *Repository*: Addition, deletion and updating integrated repositories.
