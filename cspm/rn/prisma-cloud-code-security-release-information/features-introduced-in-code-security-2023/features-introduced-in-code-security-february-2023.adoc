|*Code Security Developer-Based Metering Plan*

|Prisma Cloud is introducing a new developer-based metering plan for Code Security.
The plan introduces an a-la-carte model which includes three Code Security modules each using credits per developer.

* *Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security*: The module requires 3 credits per developer to help you with security throughout the infrastructure lifecycle.
* *Software Composition Analysis (SCA)*: The model requires 4 credits per developer where developers are equipped to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in open-source dependencies.
* *Secrets Security*: The module requires 1 credit per developer to scan all files to prevent exposing API keys, passwords, certificates, tokens, and other sensitive secrets with high fidelity using any of your VCS integrations.

A credit per developer within each of the modules is a user who actively commits on Git, identified through a unique Git email address with a contribution history to any Git repositories in the last 90 days.
Enable one or more Code Security modules for an enhanced shift-left experience on the Prisma Cloud console (*Settings > Code Security Configuration*)
You can always choose to reconfigure your licensing configuration during the shift-left experience.

|*Manage Network Tunnels for self-hosted version control systems (VCS)*

| Establish secure and managed access between your self-hosted version control systems (VCS) and Prisma Cloud using Transporter.
After configuring a Transporter in your environment, followed by authentication from Prisma Cloud, Transporter establishes a network tunnel through the WebSocket over HTTPS. A single Transporter on the Prisma Cloud can secure multiple VCS integrations, or you can use multiple Transporters. This feature will be available on request.
