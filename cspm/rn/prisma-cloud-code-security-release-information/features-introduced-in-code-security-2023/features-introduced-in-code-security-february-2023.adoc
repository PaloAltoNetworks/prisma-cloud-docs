|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*License Updates for Code Security*

|Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition is introducing two new Code Security modules:

* Software Composition Analysis (SCA), offered at 4 credits per developer.
* Secrets Scanning, offered at 1 credit per developer.

Additionally, the existing Prisma Cloud Code Security module is being renamed to IaC Security, and offered at 3 credits per developer.
To avail of these new modules, you need to switch from a resource-block based metering plan to a developer-based plan. You can make this switch from *Settings > Code Security Configuration* on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. After you switch, the new plan will calculate your credit usage based on the number of developers who use the Code Security modules that are enabled.

|*Manage Network Tunnels for self-hosted version control systems (VCS)*

| Establish secure and managed access between your self-hosted version control systems (VCS) and Prisma Cloud using Transporter.
After configuring a Transporter in your environment, followed by authentication from Prisma Cloud, Transporter establishes a network tunnel through the WebSocket over HTTPS. A single Transporter on the Prisma Cloud can secure multiple VCS integrations, or you can use multiple Transporters. This feature will be available on request.
