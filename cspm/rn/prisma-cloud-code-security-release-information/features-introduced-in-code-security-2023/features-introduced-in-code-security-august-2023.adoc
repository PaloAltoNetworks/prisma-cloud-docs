|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Code Security has a New Name*
//RLP-106732
|Starting with 23.8.1, Cloud Application Security is the new name for the combination of the Cloud Code Security capabilities and the newly introduced CI/CD Security module. CI/CD Security is available as a standard a-la-carte option or as an add-on with the Prisma Cloud Runtime Security Foundations or Advanced bundles.

Owing to the name change, the path to Projects, Development Pipelines and Supply Chain will now be Application Security instead of Code Security on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The change does impact any existing workflows for scanning and fixing issues.


|*New Policies for Cloud Application Security (previously Cloud Code Security)*
//RLP-107182
|Starting with the 23.8.1 release, 125 new Config policies of subtype Build that enable the detection of CI/CD security risks will be enabled by default and available on the *Policies* page. With the release, the Code Security capabilities are being renamed as Application Security, and also will introduce CI/CD Security.

These new policies will not generate any alerts until you enable  the new *CI/CD Security* capability on "Settings > Application Security Configuration". When you subscribe the CI/CD Security capability, when it becomes available, the alerts will display on "Application Security > CI/CD Risks".
