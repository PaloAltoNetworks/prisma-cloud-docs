== Features Introduced in March 2022

Learn about the new Code Security capabilities on Prismaâ„¢ Cloud Enterprise Edition (SaaS) in March 2022.

The following new features or enhancements are available for Prisma Cloud Code Security. These capabilities help agile teams add security checks to their existing IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) model and enforce security throughout the build lifecycle.

|Feature
|Description


|*IaC Tag and Trace*
|Use the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/iac-tag-and-trace[tagging] capability to manage resource tags in the most cost and time-efficient manner, and trace drift in configuration. Tracing helps you identify what has changed and where, so that you can keep cloud configurations synchronized with IaC templates.

Using Yor, an auto-tagging tool, all runtime resources are scanned, and for every non-compliant resource, Yor auto creates a PR (Pull Request) in the repository for you to review.You can then manage a list of tag and tag rules for your IaC infrastructure on menu:Code{sp}Security[Projects > Manage Tags] to enable or disable auto-created tags from Yor ( yor_trace), manage out-of-the-box tags, and custom tags, edit, clone, and delete custom tags, or add a new tag and a tag rule.

|*Supply Chain Security*
|To help you assess and mitigate the risks in your supply chain (menu:Code{sp}Security[Supply Chain]) provides a view into how your Iac templates and application security are connected. The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/supply-chain-security.html[dashboard] maps all of the components and processes of your software supply chain to help you understand the threat surface, identify the risk chains, and show you where you need to focus your security efforts.

The new supply chain graph leverages a new data model that uses data from the current scanner findings, to provide you with real-time discovery of potential misconfigurations and where vulnerabilities exist in both code and in resources that are deployed. The graph helps you visualize the files, resources, and pipeline components that make up your code and ultimately, your cloud environments.

|*Code Security API*
|The https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/code[Prisma Cloud Code Security API] is now available. This API enables you to:

* Initiate Code Security scans of repositories you've added to Prisma Cloud
* View the repositories you've connected to Code Security
* Manage Code Security suppression rules
* Fix or suppress Code Security policy violations
