|*IaC Security in Git Repositories, CI/CD and IDEs*

|*Visibility and Remediation*
|In addition to continuously scanning your Git repositories and viewing results directly on the Prisma Cloud administrative console, you can export the results to different SIEM tools to support your workflows.

You can also remediate and suppress issues through Pull Request (PR) automation workflows in the Prisma Cloud administrative console as well as special syntax in the actual IaC code. For example, you can add a commented annotation in your source code and suppress findings in IaC files.

|The Out-of the-Box build policies on Prisma Cloud have been updated to include all IaC Security related policies from Bridgecrew. The name and descriptions of the Bridgecrew policies integrated on Prisma Cloud have been updated to be consistent with the platform.
