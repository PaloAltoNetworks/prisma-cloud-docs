|*Development Pipelines*
|https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/development-pipelines.html[Development pipelines] provides a bird’s eye view of your onboarded repositories and latest scan results across all VCS and CI/CD integrations.

This summary view (menu:Code{sp}Security[Development Pipelines]) enables you to hone in to what matters most to you:

* Focus on VCS repositories with the highest rate of failed pull or merge requests.
* Review VCS repositories with the highest activity based on active git users who committed changes to the default branch weekly andover the last 90 days.
* Assess the most recent code reviews that triggered scans with the largest number of critical alerts and failures.
* Scan the results for the last 1000 code scans across all integrations.
* Define enforcement rules that determine your quality criteria for all scans within a repository.
