|Feature
|Description


|*Software Composition Analysis (SCA)*
|Software Composition Analysis (https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/software-composition-analysis[SCA]) enables you to continuously scan any open source packages defined in your source code. The scan enables you to find and fix vulnerabilities in code and identify license violations earlier in the development lifecycle so that you can address risks in a timely manner. The scan runs across all integrations of repositories, IDE and CI/CD pipelines to give you:

* Contextual information on Bill of Materials or Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), an inventory list of all open source packages and third-party components your source code utilizes. (menu:Code{sp}Security[Development Pipelines])

* Visualization on direct and sub-dependencies between open source packages to help you identify vulnerabilities outside root dependency. (menu:Code{sp}Security[Supply Chain])

* Information to identify potential software license violations and manually fix or suppress the issue. (menu:Code{sp}Security[Projects])

* A list of vulnerabilities identified on open source packages that you can either suppress or directly fix in code. (menu:Code{sp}Security[Projects])
