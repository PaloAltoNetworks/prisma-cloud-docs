|Description


|*Enforcement Thresholds and Scope*
|https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/enforcement[Enforcement] enables you to define the thresholds for reducing unnecessary noise in your code reviews and focusing on the most critical issues across the following categories— Open Source (SCA), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Secrets, Container Images, and Build Integrity.

Based on best practice guidelines Prisma Cloud provides default enforcement settings. If you had previously configured any rules on menu:Settings[Code Security Configuration], these are migrated as your thresholds and scope for enforcement.

To modify the enforcement configuration (menu:Code{sp}Security[Projects > More Actions > Enforcement]) for all repositories that you are monitoring using Prisma Cloud, you must specify the severity —Critical, High, Medium and Low—of policy violations for which you want to soft fail, hard fail, or enable bot comments to suggest fixes where available.You can also add exceptions for one or more repositories where you need a more stringent or more lenient approach to enforcement.

|*Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)*
|Integrate https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/get-started/connect-your-repositories/add-terraform-run-tasks[Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)](menu:Settings[Add Repositories > Terraform Cloud (Run Tasks)]) to seamlessly add policy-as-code checks to your Terraform pipelines for completely automated security guardrails and enable you to collect feedback or directly block insecure deployments.

|Change
|Description


|*Code Reviews and Pull Request Bot Comments for Code Security Configuration*
|With this release, new Enforcement options are available for code reviews. With the enhancement, the ability to configure Code Reviews and Pull Request Bot Comments is no longer part of the Code Security Configuration on menu:Settings[Code Security Configuration]. Instead, these capabilities are now available as a part of Enforcement on menu:Code{sp}Security[Projects > More Actions > Enforcement].

This change does not impact your existing configuration. All your existing configurations are migrated over as *Enforcement* settings. You can review and manage the enforcement thresholds and exceptions from menu:Code{sp}Security[Projects > More Actions > Enforcement].
