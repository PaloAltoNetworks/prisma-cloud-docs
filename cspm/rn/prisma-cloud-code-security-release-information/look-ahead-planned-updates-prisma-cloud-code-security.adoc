|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


|*GitHub VCS Integration*

|To help ensure that your GitHub organization and repository and GitLab repository configurations are using proper branch protection and build integrity guidelines, Prisma Cloud is adding Build Integrity policies in the upcoming release. These permissions are required to pull organization and repository configurations and scan them for Supply Chain policy violations.
The following additional read-only permissions are being requested:

* administration: read-only
* actions: read-only
* repository_hooks: read-only
* organization_hooks: read-only

If you opt to reject or ignore the request for the additional permissions, there will be no impact on existing scans; however, you will not be able to detect violations of the build integrity policies.
