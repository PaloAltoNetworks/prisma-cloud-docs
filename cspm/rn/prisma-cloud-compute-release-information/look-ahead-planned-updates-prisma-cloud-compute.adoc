//=== Deprecation Notices

//=== Changes in Existing Behavior

=== Breaking Changes

//CWP-49402 - Document GCP org policy exclusion mechanism
* TBD

=== API Changes
//CWP-29369 - Support for GitLab Container Registry
Registry Settings API supports GitLab Container Registry

Starting with 30.03, you no longer need to add GitLab Container Registry through Docker V2 registry which required administrative permissions to scan all registries.

You can now directly add GitLab Container Registry in the `POST, settings/registry` endpoint by using the new schema `gitlabRegistrySpec` in the request body to add GitLab Container Registry.

To add, you must specify the following parameters:

* *version*:  Specify the value `gitlab` for GitLab Container Registry.
* *registry*: Specify the GitLab registry URL address. Example, for native registries, you can specify the address as `https://registry.gitlab.com` 
* *credentialID*: Specify the GitLab credential that you added in the credential store in Prisma Cloud Compute. Example, API token that has atleast the `read_api` scope.
* *gitlabRegistrySpec*: Specify at least one of the following fields:

        * *userID*: Specify your GitLab user ID to add all registries associated with it.
        * *projectIDs*: Specify the project IDs to add all registries associated with a GitLab project.
        * *groupIDs*: Specify the group ID to add all registries associated with a GitLab group.
        * *excludedGroupIDs*: Specify the top level group IDs that you don't want to add.


*Old (30.02 and earlier releases)* 

Example request body schema:

[source,json]

    "version": "2",
    "registry": "",

    "os": "linux",
    "cap": 5,
    "scanners": 2,
    "collections": ["All"]
}

*New (in release 30.03)*

Example request body schema showing *gitlabRegistrySpec* that contains the *userID* to add and scan all registries associated with it:

    "version":"gitlab",

    "namespace":"",
    "repository":"",
