|*Support 3rd party packages on Windows*
//CWP-46134	
|This feature adds support for scanning vulnerabilities on 3rd part packages on Windows machines: node-nodejs, python, ruby-gem, java-jar, nuget.

|*Tags support of agentless scanning*
//CWP-48025
+++<draft-comment>CWP-46156</draft-comment>+++

|The new include hosts by tag feature allows you to select a subset of your hosts for scanning based on their tags. You can also use the improved tags UI to view and manage your tags more easily. Additionally, you can now use wildcards to exclude or include hosts that match a certain tag pattern. For example, you can use `web-*` to include all hosts that have a tag starting with `web-`. This feature helps you scan your hosts more effectively and flexibly.

|*Refactor agentless scanner orchestrator to support parallel scans of accounts/regions.*
+++<draft-comment>CWP-44459</draft-comment>+++
|Adds the ability for Agentless scanning to scan accounts and regions within those accounts in parallel.
This capability will be a gradual roll out on all Prisma Cloud tenants.

Additional changes include:

- UI enhancements: 

-- You can now see specific account status (scanning, completed etc.), and accounts by that status

-- The cloud accounts page now shows the general scan progress instead of the progress bar

- Hub account related changes:

-- Hub account is now treated as an account dedicated for Agentless scanning and hence will be used to only scan other accounts

-- Scan related configuration are done centrally on the hub account configuration and not required to be duplicated across all target accounts. e.g., networking configuration can only be set on the hub account.

2+|*Enhancement in Host Security*

|*Discovery Date for Host vulnerability scan results*
+++<draft-comment>CWP-47858</draft-comment>+++
