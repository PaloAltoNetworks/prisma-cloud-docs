=== Enhancements

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|Expanded Support for Red Hat's Non-RPM Content
|The Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream now includes vulnerability data on non-RPM content from Red Hat, including binaries, Python scripts, JavaScript files, and Java JAR files within layered products like OpenShift.
Rather than just flagging these as vulnerable, Prima Cloud can now leverage Red Hat's own detailed image analysis, enhancing precision in threat detection.

|End of Support for Cloud Native Network Segmentation (CNNS)
|The ability to create CNNS policies that Defenders use to limit traffic from containers and hosts is being deprecated. The configuration settings on the console (*Compute > Defend > CNNS*) and the corresponding APIs for CNNS will be removed in the next major release.

Radar has a container and a host view, where you can view the network topology for your containerized apps and hosts respectively, and this will continue to be available.

List of API endpoints that are no longer supported:

* PUT, `{{/api/v<VERSION>/policies/firewall/network/container}}`
* GET, `{{/api/v<VERSION>/policies/firewall/network}}`
* GET, `{{/api/v<VERSION>/audits/firewall/network/container/download}}`
* GET, `{{/api/v<VERSION>/audits/firewall/network/container}}`
* GET, `{{/api/v<VERSION>/audits/firewall/network/host/download}}`
* GET, `{{/api/v<VERSION>/audits/firewall/network/host}}`

|End of Support for Docker Access Control
|Docker Access Control (`defend/access/docker`) and the Access User role (`manage/authentication/roles`)  are no longer supported.

|Support for Code Repo Scanning
|Scanning your code repositories from the Prisma Cloud Compute console at *Compute > Monitor> Vulnerabilities > Code repositories* and use of Twistcli for code repo scanning was planned for End of Support in v32.0.xxx. The deprecation is now  extended until the next major release code named O'Neal (v33.0.xxx), when the support will be dropped.

You must now use the *Code Security* capabilities on Prisma Cloud to scan IaC templates, code repositories, and CI pipelines for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

|Agentless Scanning for Azure - Error in onboarded Azure government accounts
|Fixed an issue preventing agentless scanning of onboarded Azure government accounts

|Unable to scan containers when failing to list one container's details
|Fixed an issue caused when listing container details of containers on hosts using Docker as the CRI. The issue led to agentless scanning not discovering containers on the specified host.
The fix improves the scan process tolerance to errors during the retrieval of containers metadata.

|Inconsistent reporting of AKS cluster names and type
|Fixed an issue where AKS cluster names were not properly processed and the cluster was incorrectly classified as a generic Kubernetes cluster instead of an AKS cluster.
Now, the cluster names and their type are  properly parsed as AKS clusters.
