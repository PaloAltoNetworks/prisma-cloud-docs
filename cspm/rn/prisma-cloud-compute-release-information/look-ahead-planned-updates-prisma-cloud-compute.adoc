== Look Ahead â€” Planned Updates on Prisma Cloud Compute

Review any deprecation notices and new features planned in the next Prisma Cloud Compute release.

See xref:prisma-cloud-compute-release-information.adoc#id79d9af81-3080-471d-9cd1-afe25c775be3[Prisma Cloud Compute Release Information] for the latest features of the host, container, and serverless capabilities that are available on the *Compute* tab on Prisma Cloud.
//The latest release 31.00.xx is planned for August 20, 2023.

The details and functionality listed below are a preview of what is planned in the next Compute update planned for August 20, 2023; the changes listed herein and the actual release date, are subject to change.

=== Defender Upgrade
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|*Plan to Upgrade Defender Versions 22.06 and Earlier*
| With the upcoming v31.xx.xxx (Newton) release, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/welcome/support_lifecycle[Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2)] are v31.xx.xxx, v30.xx.xxx, and v22.12.xxx. 

To prepare for this update,  you must upgrade your Defenders from version v22.06.xx.xxx (Kepler) or earlier to a later version.
Failure to upgrade Defenders will result in disconnection of any Defender version below 22.12 such as 22.06.

=== Enhancements

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|*Expanded Support for Red Hat's Non-RPM Content*
|The Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream now includes vulnerability data on non-RPM content from Red Hat, including binaries, Python scripts, JavaScript files, and Java JAR files within layered products like OpenShift.
Rather than just flagging these as vulnerable, Prima Cloud can now leverage Red Hat's own detailed image analysis, enhancing precision in threat detection.

|*Support of Registry Tags directly in Compute Collections*
|Added support for registry labels under collections to enable role-based access control (RBAC).
The scan results for deployed images are now segregated with a *Custom label* within collections.
This enhancement facilitates the association between the registry and the scanned images pertaining to that registry, along with registry-based role-based access control (RBAC) for improved security and management.

|*Support for Continuous Integration (CI) Scanning of Images on Linux Using Containerd*
|Added the ability for users to run CI scans on Linux using the containerd runtime. This change benefits customers using Kubernetes environments, which no longer support Docker as they need to perform CI scans without Docker.

|*GKE CIS Compliance Checks for Worker Nodes*
|CIS Benchmark for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) version 1.4.0 is now supported.
This update includes compliance checks for worker nodes.

=== Deprecation Notices
[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|*End of Support for Docker Access Control*
|The Docker Access Control at *Defend > Access > Docker* and Access User role at *Manage > Authentication > Roles* were planned for End of Support in Newton (v31.00.xxx) as announced in https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-release-notes/release-information/release-notes-22-06#:~:text=Upcoming%20Deprecation%20Notifications[22.06 Release Notes].
The deprecation is now extended until the next release Newton Update 1 (v31.01.xxx), when the feature will be no longer supported.

|*Support for Code Repo Scanning*
|Scanning your code repositories from the Prisma Cloud Compute console at *Compute > Monitor> Vulnerabilities > Code repositories* and use of Twistcli for code repo scanning was planned for End of Support in this release v31.0.xxx. The deprecation notice is now  extended until the next major release code named O'Neal (v32.0.xxx), when the capability will be dropped.

You must now use the *Code Security* capabilities on Prisma Cloud to scan IaC templates, code repositories, and CI pipelines for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

|*Support for Cloud Native Network Segmentation (CNNS)*
//https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-49167
|The ability to create CNNS policies that Defenders use to limit traffic from containers and hosts was planned for End of Support in this release v31.0.xxx. The deprecation notice is now  extended until the next major release code named O'Neal (v32.0.xxx). The configuration settings on the console (*Compute > Defend > CNNS*) and the corresponding APIs for CNNS will be dropped in v32.0.xxx.

Radar has a container and a host view, where you can view the network topology for your containerized apps and hosts respectively, and this will continue to be available.

//=== Changes in Existing Behavior

//=== Breaking Changes

=== Fixed Issues

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===

|*Fixed Harbor support*
|Fixed an issue limiting the support of Prisma Cloud Compute as a pluggable scanner in Harbor.
The support is now extended to instances where the Defenders operate in a CRI environment.

|*Fixed Missing version detection in JAR packages*
|Fixed an issue that caused missing version detection for jar packages when the version name included a date, for example, 20171018.

|*Agentless Scanning for Azure - Fixed error in onboarded Azure government accounts*
|Fixed an issue preventing agentless scanning of onboarded Azure government accounts

|*Agentless Scanning - Fixed being unable to scan containers when failing to list one container's details*
|Fixed an issue caused when listing container details of containers on hosts using Docker as the CRI. The issue led to agentless scanning not discovering containers on the specified host.
The fix improves the scan process tolerance to errors during the retrieval of containers metadata.

|*Agentless Scanning - Fixed missing OS labels of hosts scanned using agentless scanning*
|Added missing OS labels, both `osDistro` and `osVersion`, to hosts scanned by agentless scanning.

|*Inconsistent reporting of AKS cluster names and type*
|Fixed an issue where AKS cluster names were not properly processed and the cluster was incorrectly classified as a generic Kubernetes cluster instead of an AKS cluster.
Now, the cluster names and their type are  properly parsed as AKS clusters.
