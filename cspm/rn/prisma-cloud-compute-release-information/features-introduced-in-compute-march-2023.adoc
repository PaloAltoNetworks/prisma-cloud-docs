2+|*CVE Coverage Update*

|
| As part of the 22.12 release, Prisma Cloud has rolled out updates to its vulnerability data for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the Intelligence Stream. The new additions are as follows:

//https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/CWP-46080
* Fixed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25173[CVE-2023-25173] and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25153[CVE-2023-25153] (Severity - Moderate): `containerd` vulnerability seen in <compute and/or defender>, <impacting this> are addressed by upgrading to `containerd` version v1.6.18 and v1.5.18.
* Fixed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1996[CVE-2022-1996] (Severity - Critical) is included in the Intelligence Stream feed. The Go-Restful package is a transitive dependency that is pulled with http://k8s.io/client-go[k8s.io/client-go] and http://k8s.io/kube-openapi[k8s.io/kube-openapi] and is not being used directly in the Compute Defender and Console, thus it is suppressed.

2+|*Enhancements*

|
|Improved testing to support the automatic updates of GKE Autopilot clusters. The latest three Prisma Cloud releases are tested daily using the latest GKE Autopilot version for continued support.

|
//CWP-45310
|Added permissions context to Defender upgrades.
When you select to Upgrade all Defenders under *Manage >  Defenders > Deployed Defenders*, you can only upgrade the Defenders that are eligible for upgrade and for which you have the permissions to upgrade, based on your Prisma Cloud role.
This change applies to upgrades for Host and Container Defenders on Linux and Windows.
