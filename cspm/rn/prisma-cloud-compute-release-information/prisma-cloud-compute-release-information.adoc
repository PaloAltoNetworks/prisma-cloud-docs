https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin[Prisma™ Cloud] is an API-based integration that provides security at all stages of the software delivery process. It provides visibility in to your resources deployed across different environments, and checks your adherence to compliance standards and security best practices for your assets at runtime, and IaC templates and images even before the resources are deployed.

On Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition, the *Compute* tab comprises the Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) capabilities that help you secure your host, containers, and serverless deployments across public cloud, private cloud and on-premises environments, throughout the application lifecycle. It combines runtime protection with vulnerability management and compliance to secure cloud native workloads across build, deploy and run stages of the lifecycle.
