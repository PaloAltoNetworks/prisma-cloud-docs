|Feature
|Description


|OpenShift Version Support
|Support for OpenShift 4.9.0.


|Debug Mode for App-Embedded Defender
|To debug crashes or other issues when Defender can't connect to Console, you can enable the debug mode for App-Embedded Defender to write all logs to stdout.

To enable the debug mode, specify an environment variable named screen:[TW_DEBUG] and set it to screen:[TRUE]


|WAAS — Support for an SNI-Based Proxy
|WAAS adds support for Server Name Indication field (SNI) in a proxy so that you can serve multiple top-level domains, each with different TLS certificates, on the same internal port.

Support for SNI enables certificate verification for different applications where you need to forward TLS traffic to the host specified in the SNI.

|Change in Behavior


|Filtering For Unactionable Vulnerabilities
|On menu:Compute[Manage > System > Scan > Unactionable vulnerabilities] when you enable the toggle, vulnerabilities are filtered by both severity level and fix plan. Previously, when the toggle was enabled, it filtered out vulnerabilities by severity level only. Now, the results for unactionable vulnerabilities do not include:

* Vulnerabilities with a severity level of *negligible* and a fix plan of *won't fix*.

* Vulnerabilities of any severity with a fix plan of *won't fix*.


|Serverless Scan Results
|The last serverless scan results on menu:Defend[Vulnerabilities > Functions > Functions] are retained if a currently running scan is cancelled by a newly invoked scan.

Previously, when an in-progress serverless scan was cancelled, the results from the last scan were deleted, and the display would include empty or partial results.

The new scan that caused the previous scan to be cancelled won't start or run.
