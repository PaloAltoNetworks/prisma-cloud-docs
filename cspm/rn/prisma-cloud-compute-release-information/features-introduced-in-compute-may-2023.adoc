[#disa-stig]
=== DISA STIG Scan Findings and Justifications

Every https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-public-sector/Release_Findings[release], we perform an SCAP scan of the Prisma Cloud Compute Console and Defender images. The process is based upon the U.S. Air Force's Platform 1 "Repo One" OpenSCAP scan of the Prisma Cloud Compute images. We compare our scan results to IronBank's latest approved UBI8-minimal scan findings. Any discrepancies are addressed or justified.
