=== New Features in Prisma Cloud Compute

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|Feature
|Description


|*HTTPS Proxy Support for Agentless Scanning*
+++<draft-comment>39229</draft-comment>+++
|Agentless scanning now supports connections over an HTTPS proxy server. If you use custom certificates for authentication, you can now configure custom certificates for the connection to Console when using Agentless scanning.


|*Support for Embedding a Defender in a CloudFormation Fargate Task*
+++<draft-comment>39754</draft-comment>+++
|Prisma Cloud Compute now supports embedding a Defender to a CloudFormation Fargate task in the YAML format, in addition to the JSON format. You can use a full CloudFormation template that contains other objects in addition to the Fargate task to generate a protected Fargate task definition.

Use the Console (menu:Compute[Manage > Defenders > Deploy > Defenders]) or the APIs (/api/22.06/defenders/fargate.yaml, /api/22.06/defenders/fargate.json) to complete the workflow.


|*Cloud Native Network Segmentation*
+++<draft-comment>GH#39872</draft-comment>+++
|The Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF) is now renamed as Cloud Native Network Segmentation (CNNS) in menu:Compute[Radars > Settings] , and you can create policies for enforcing Layer 4 communication from hosts and containers on menu:Compute[Defend > CNNS].


|*Update for CVE-2022-36085*
|As part of the 22.06.213 release, Prisma Cloud has rolled out an update to the vulnerability data stream for https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36085[CVE-2022-36085]. After updating to the enhanced intelligence feed, you may see alerts on vulnerabilities in Prisma Cloud components and Defender images of releases 22.06 or older versions. We have determined that Prisma Cloud components are not impacted by these vulnerabilities. There is no risk to continue running any of the supported Prisma Cloud releases.

=== Addressed Issues

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|ISSUE
|DESCRIPTION


|PCSUP-10988

+++<draft-comment>PCSUP-1940</draft-comment>+++
|Fixed an internal error that failed to refresh the vulnerability statistics under menu:Compute[Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer].


|PCSUP-10841
|Fixed an issue with permissions in the AWS Gov template for agentless scanning.


|PCSUP-10791
|Fixed an issue with editing WAAS rules. On upgrade to 22.06, you could not update or modify WAAS rules configured to protect the same port for multiple protocols, such as TLS, HTTP2, and gRPC.With this fix, such rules can now be modified.


|PCSUP-10632
|Fixed an issue that caused Defender to incorrectly report the Host OS as SLES15SP1 instead of SLES15.


|PCSUP-10507
|Fixed two issues with Defenders running on containerd/CRI-O nodes:

Defenders attempted to scan host file systems during image scans for containers that changed to the host mount namespace. This issue is fixed.

Defenders attempted to scan the host filesystem as some parent directory was a symlink. The issue was fixed by ignoring the images scans running from the host namespace to avoid false binary detections.

|*Maven system dependencies*
+++<draft-comment>// GH#38468</draft-comment>+++
|With the End of Support for Maven system dependencies, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender[Defender injection for Java functions] is now implemented using the bundle as a Maven internal repository. With this update, userinput:[<systemPath>] dependency is no longer used.


|*Compile dependency in Gradle 7.0*
+++<draft-comment>// GH#39984</draft-comment>+++
|With the End of Support for compile dependency in Gradle 7.0, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender[Defender injection for Java functions] is updated to an implementation dependency using an internal repository.

|*Breaking Change in Lagrange*
+++<draft-comment>// GH#40768</draft-comment>+++
|On upgrade to the next release, code named Lagrange that is planned for the end of this CY, if you have configured an alert profile on menu:Compute[Manage > Alerts] and enabled *Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed)* and *Immediately alert for deployed resources*, you will now receive immediate alerts for vulnerable registry images along with immediate alerts for deployed images.

image::immediate-alert-registry-images.png[scale=25]

The volume of immediate alerts that are generated maybe much higher than what you've seen in the previous releases because support for immediate alerting for registry images is being added in Lagrange. With this change, the *Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed)* option is being separated into two: *Deployed images vulnerabilities* and *Registry images vulnerabilities*, and both these triggers will be automatically enabled on upgrade, if the original trigger was enabled in the alert profile.
