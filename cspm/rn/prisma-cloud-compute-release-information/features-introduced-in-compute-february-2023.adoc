Upgrade your Prisma Cloud console and deployed Defenders if you use WAAS to inspect HTTP2 traffic.

* https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1495[CVE-2022-41721] is included in the Intelligence Stream feed. Prisma Cloud doesn't use `MaxBytesHandler` and this vulnerability doesn't impact Prisma Cloud components.
You can continue to run any of the supported Prisma Cloud releases without risk from this vulnerability.
To remove the vulnerability alert, upgrade to the latest 22.12 release.
If you are not ready to upgrade right away, add an exception in the default *Ignore Twistlock Components* rule.
Go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Deployed* to add the exception to suppress the vulnerability alerts for CVE-2022-41721.

2+|*Enhancements*

//CWP-36621
|Added support for cgroupv2:
|* *Scans*:
** Full support for cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.
** Hybrid mode not supported: this will not fail the scan, but the scan will run without the process limitation protection.

* *WAAS*:
** In-Line firewall:
*** Full support for cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.
*** Hybrid mode: partially supported. It is supported if the memory and CPU controllers are both under the legacy hierarchy (v1). Otherwise, the firewall will fail.

** Out-Of-Band firewall:
*** Only cgroup v1 is fully supported.
*** Cgroup v2: not supported. The firewall will run but the memory limit of the defender's cgroup will not be increased.
*** Hybrid mode: partially supported. Same as WAAS In-Line.

* *Support*: cgroup v2 is not supported for Talos and other operating systems that don't have `systemd`.
