//CWP-47358
|*Package URL (pURL) Format Support for Vulnerabilities*
|Prisma Cloud now adds package URLs (pURL) for packages and vulnerabilities while https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/tools/twistcli_scan_images[scanning the images using twistcli]. This helps to reliably reference the same software package using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.

As you scan images with `twistcli`, you can filter the CVEs based on the pURL format in the CVE viewer.

//CWP-44490
|*Registry Scan Scale Support Increased to 100k Images*
|Registry image scan limit has been increased to 1,000,000 from 100,000 for all image types.

//CWP-29369
|*Support for GitLab Container Registry*
|Added support for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/registry_scanning/scan-gitlab[scanning GitLab Container Registry] without using admin credentials to manage and get a full list of all container registries/images.

//CWP-41082
|*Malware Support through Wildfire Integration*
|Added enhanced malware https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning[agentless scanning] through an integration with Palo Alto Networks Advanced WildFire, the industry's leading malware scanning feed.
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/compliance/malware[Malware scanning] is supported across all Cloud Service Providers for Linux and Windows hosts and Linux container images, covering files suspected as Malware or Grayware.
Malware scanning supports ELF binaries in Linux and supports binaries and shared libraries in Windows, providing comprehensive protection.

//CWP-44086
|*Scan Errors Visibility Improvements in Agentless Scanning*
|To get the most out of agentless scanning, this update categorizes issues during the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning[agentless scan process], provides detailed information on their nature, source, and troubleshooting steps, and offers a seamless user interface experience. Easily understand and resolve issues, improving scan coverage and streamlining your scanning process.

As a side effect, this update might display erroneous scan details, that would be auto-remediated by a maximum of 2 agentless scan cycles.

//CWP-48291
|*Added Support for Parallel Agentless Scans of Accounts/Regions*
|Updated the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning#scanning-process[agentless scanning process] to scan accounts and regions within those accounts in parallel.

|CHANGE
|DESCRIPTION

//CWP-29369 and CWP-49652
|*Registry Settings API supports GitLab Container Registry*
|Starting with 30.03, you no longer need to add GitLab Container Registry through Docker V2 registry which required administrative permissions to scan all images.

You can now directly add GitLab Container Registry in the `POST, settings/registry` endpoint by using the new schema `gitlabRegistrySpec` in the request body.

To add, you must specify the following parameters:

* *version*:  Specify the value *gitlab* for GitLab Container Registry.
* *registry*: Specify the GitLab registry URL address. Example, for native registries, you can specify the address as "https://registry.gitlab.com" 
* *credentialID*: Specify the GitLab credential that you added in the credential store in Prisma Cloud Compute. For example, an API token that has atleast the *read_api* scope.
* *gitlabRegistrySpec*: Specify at least one of the following fields:

    * *userID*: Specify your GitLab user ID to add all registries associated with it.
    * *projectIDs*: Specify the project IDs to add all registries associated with a GitLab project.
    * *groupIDs*: Specify the group ID to add all registries associated with a GitLab group.
    * *excludedGroupIDs*: Specify the top-level group IDs that you don't want to add.

*Old (30.02 and earlier releases)* 

Example request body schema:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "2",
    "registry": "",
    "credentialID": "<GitLab Token>",
    "repository": "library/ubuntu",
    "tag": "16.04",
    "os": "linux",
    "cap": 5,
    "scanners": 2,
    "collections": ["All"]
}
----

*New (in release 30.03)*

Example request body schema showing *gitlabRegistrySpec* that contains the *userID* to add and scan all registries associated with it:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version":"gitlab",
    "registry":"https://registry.gitlab.com",
    "namespace":"",
    "repository":"",
    "tag":"",
    "credentialID":"<GitLab Token>",
    "os":"linux",
    "harborDeploymentSecurity":false,
    "collections":["All"],
    "cap":5,
    "scanners":2,
    "versionPattern":"",
    "gitlabRegistrySpec":{"userID":"14631394"}
}
