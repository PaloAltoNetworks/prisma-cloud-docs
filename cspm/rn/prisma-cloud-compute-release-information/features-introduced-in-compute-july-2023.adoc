|Prisma Cloud now adds package URLs (pURL) for packages and vulnerabilities while https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/tools/twistcli_scan_images[scanning the images using `twistcli`]. This helps to reliably reference the same software package using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.

As you scan images with `twistcli`, you can filter the CVEs based on the pURL format in the CVE viewer.
