|Issue ID
|Description

//CWP-51415
|tt:[Fixed in 31.02.133]
|Fixed issue in RHEL clusters running NodeOS where compliance checks didn't show any non-compliant alerts.

//CWP-51013
|tt:[Fixed in 31.02.133]
|Fixed an issue where Defender failed to block containers when containers were restarted frequently and generated too many audit events. This was fixed by decreasing the number of requests sent to the Console.

//CWP-51942 //PCSUP-18500
|tt:[Fixed in 31.02.133] 
//*REST API Rate Limiting*
|Fixed an issue where REST API requests triggered rate limiting after 23 requests in a 30 second interval. With this fix, the rate limit for Prisma Cloud Compute REST APIs is increased to 30 requests in 30 seconds.

//CWP-50733 //PCSUP-18095
|tt:[Fixed in 31.01.123] 
//*Host Defender Deployment Erorr*
|Fixed an error in deploying and upgrading the Host Defenders on Windows Server 2019 installed on AWS.

//CWP-35771 //PCSUP-7591
|tt:[Fixed in 31.01.123] 
//*Node count for EKS clusters in Cloud discovery*
|Fixed an issue where node count was missing for EKS clusters under *Manage > Cloud accounts* cloud *Discovery* report. The correct node count is now displayed on the Console and in https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-cloud-discovery[API Cloud Discovery scan results].

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
//*Harbor support*
|Fixed an issue limiting the support of Prisma Cloud Compute as a pluggable scanner in Harbor.
The support is now extended to instances where the Defenders operate in a CRI environment.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
// *Missing version detection in JAR packages*
|Fixed an issue that caused missing version detection for jar packages when the version name included a date, for example, 20171018.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129]
// *Agentless Scanning for Azure - Error in onboarded Azure government accounts*
|Fixed an issue preventing agentless scanning of onboarded Azure government accounts

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
//*Agentless Scanning - Unable to scan containers when failing to list one container's details*
|Fixed an issue caused when listing container details of containers on hosts using Docker as the CRI. The issue led to agentless scanning not discovering containers on the specified host.
The fix improves the scan process tolerance to errors during the retrieval of containers metadata.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
// *Agentless Scanning - Missing OS labels of hosts scanned using agentless scanning*
|Added missing OS labels, both `osDistro` and `osVersion`, to hosts scanned by agentless scanning.

//CWP-50923
|
//*Inconsistent reporting of AKS cluster names and type*
|AKS clusters with an underscore "_" in the resource group name are detected as vanilla Kubernetes clusters instead of AKS clusters in the host scan results.

|*PCSUP-11309*
//added Kepler Update 2
|The userinput:[--tarball] option in twistcli does not scan for compliance checks. Currently, only vulnerabilities are detected successfully.

|*—* 
// #22837
|Windows hosts running Defender are reported as unprotected. This issue occurs when Defender is installed on Windows hosts in AWS and Cloud Discovery is configured to scan your environment for protected hosts.


|*—* 
//25757
|If you have the same custom compliance rule in use in a host policy (effect: alert) and a container policy (effect: block), the rules will enforce your policy (as expected), but the audit message for a blocked container will incorrectly refer to the host policy and host rule name.


|*—* 
// #35634/35308
|On the menu:Radar[Containers], K3s clusters are not displayed when a Defender is deployed with an empty cluster name. You can view the containers within these clusters under *Non-cluster containers*.

|*—* 
// GH#42826
|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

|*PCSUP-12197*
// CWP-41449
|For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.

As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.

//GH#42826
//|*-*
//|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

//CWP-39278
|*-*
|Compliance check 6361 fails for hosts running RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
The check to ensure the `iptables` package is installed fails because `iptables` was deprecated in RHEL 9 and replaced with the `nftables` package.
