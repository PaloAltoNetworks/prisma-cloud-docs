|Issue ID
|Description

|*PCSUP-11558*
//CWP-42634
|CVSS3 score wasn't displayed for Harbor 2.5 and up. This issue was caused owing to a change in Harbor. 

tt:[Fixed in 22.12.427] With this fix, Prisma Cloud handles the change.

|*PCSUP-9241*
// #39394
|For the AWS US Gov region, alerts are not forwarded successfully to the AWS Security Hub integration.
//With this fix, the correct AWS product ARN for US and China regions are used.


|*PCSUP-11309*
//added Kepler Update 2
|The userinput:[--tarball] option in twistcli does not scan for compliance checks. Currently, only vulnerabilities are detected successfully.


|*—* 

// #22837
|Windows hosts running Defender are reported as unprotected. This issue occurs when Defender is installed on Windows hosts in AWS and Cloud Discovery is configured to scan your environment for protected hosts.


|*—* 

+++<draft-comment>25757</draft-comment>+++
|If you have the same custom compliance rule in use in a host policy (effect: alert) and a container policy (effect: block), the rules will enforce your policy (as expected), but the audit message for a blocked container will incorrectly refer to the host policy and host rule name.


|*—* 
// #35634/35308
|On the menu:Radar[Containers], K3s clusters are not displayed when a Defender is deployed with an empty cluster name. You can view the containers within these clusters under *Non-cluster containers*.

|*—* 
// GH#42826
|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

|*-*
//CWP-44743
|For App-Embedded WAAS events, the *Add as exception" button does not allow you to add an exception directly from an event.  
Workaround: Manually add exceptions to rules. Click the *Rule app ID* on the "Aggregated WAAS Events" page and edit the relevant detection.

|*PCSUP-12197*
// CWP-41449
|For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.

As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.

|*PCSUP-13637*
//CWP-45176
|Fixed an issue on Tanzu Application Services Windows apps where scanner containers were not removed if there was an error during download or upload of the app's droplet.
