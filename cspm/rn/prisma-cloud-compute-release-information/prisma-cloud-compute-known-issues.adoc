|Issue ID
|Description

|tt:[Fixed in 22.12.694]
//CWP-40807
|Fixed an issue where only the numeric part of the JAR version was detected in scans, making it impossible to distinguish between versions with non-numeric qualifiers. To avoid false positives for JAR files, upgrade your Defenders to Lagrange update 3 and rescan to see the accurate results.

|tt:[Fixed in 22.12.694]
//CWP-46005 CWP-46353
|Fixed a bug, wherein the count of events for WAAS agentless did not correspond to the actual number of attack requests sent.

|tt:[22.12.585 or earlier]
//CWP-44527
|Unable to deploy a VPC configuration for WAAS agentless deployment, because the Prisma Cloud Console address is grayed out.

|*PCSUP-11558* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.427]
//CWP-42634
|CVSS3 score wasn't displayed for Harbor 2.5 and up. This issue was caused owing to a change in Harbor. 

With this fix, Prisma Cloud handles the change.

|*PCSUP-9241*  tt:[22.12.415 or later]
// #39394
|For the AWS US Gov region, alerts are not forwarded successfully to the AWS Security Hub integration.
//With this fix, the correct AWS product ARN for US and China regions are used.

|*PCSUP-11309*
//added Kepler Update 2
|The userinput:[--tarball] option in twistcli does not scan for compliance checks. Currently, only vulnerabilities are detected successfully.


|*—* 

// #22837
|Windows hosts running Defender are reported as unprotected. This issue occurs when Defender is installed on Windows hosts in AWS and Cloud Discovery is configured to scan your environment for protected hosts.


|*—* 
//25757
|If you have the same custom compliance rule in use in a host policy (effect: alert) and a container policy (effect: block), the rules will enforce your policy (as expected), but the audit message for a blocked container will incorrectly refer to the host policy and host rule name.


|*—* 
// #35634/35308
|On the menu:Radar[Containers], K3s clusters are not displayed when a Defender is deployed with an empty cluster name. You can view the containers within these clusters under *Non-cluster containers*.

|*—* 
// GH#42826
|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

|*PCSUP-12197*
// CWP-41449
|For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.

As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.

//GH#42826
|*-* tt:[22.12.415 or later]
|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

//CWP-39278
|*-*
|Compliance check 6361 fails for hosts running RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
The check to ensure the `iptables` package is installed fails because `iptables` was deprecated in RHEL 9 and replaced with the `nftables` package.

//CWP-45194 - this will be fixed in 22.12.xxx Lagrange Update 3
|*-* tt:[22.12.582] 
|The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admincompute/waas/waas_api_discovery#_inspect_discovered_endpoints[API endpoints discovered] on App-embedded deployments are missing workload values and show zero vulnerabilities, although the protected workload has vulnerabilites.


|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed crypto miner check issue that adversely impacted the performance of the host runtime protection and of the host.
Enable this check to get alerts when crypto miners are created or executed in your deployment.
You can prevent their execution by setting the *Effect* to *Prevent* in your runtime rules.

//CWP-44668 - validated by Elad/Matangi on the ticket + Add this as a known issue in 22.12 file
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed an issue in grouping the columns under *Monitor > Events*.
The events grouped by any field now display relevant results.

//CWP- 44496
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed `security group is malformed` error causing the VM image scans to fail in AWS EC2 environments.

//CWP-44755
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed issue where GCP accounts onboarded to Prisma Cloud that were used as hub accounts.
If the account had a master service account, the account was not imported to Compute.

//CWP- 31538
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed an issue where adding or updating collections in large deployments took a significant amount of time to show in Prisma Cloud.

//CWP- 42596
|*PCSUP-12236* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed an issue where the *Refresh* action on the Vulnerability Explorer page/API failed in cases where some images in the environment had a large number of containers running (~10-20K containers per image).

//CWP-44743 - Issue fixed - Reference - Alex's email
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|For App-Embedded WAAS events, the *Add as exception" button does not allow you to add an exception directly from an event.  

Workaround: Manually add exceptions to rules. Click the *Rule app ID* on the *Aggregated WAAS Events* page and edit the relevant detection.

With this fix, you can add an exception directly from an event with the *Add as exception* button.

//CWP-43836 GH##41137 - Issue fixed - Reference - Alex's email

|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed an issue where the Prisma Cloud console displayed an expired certificate warning for Defenders even if the certificate was not in use.
Now there is no incorrect warning displayed.

//CWP-44663 
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed an issue wherein the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/registry_scanning/configure_registry_scanning[registry scan] stops when there is no running Defender found in one of the registry's pre-defined scopes.
The scan will continue, and the skipped registry will be re-scanned once a running defender is found for the registry's scope.

//CWP- 44659
|*-* tt:[Fixed in 22.12.582]
|Fixed a Definition Scan API error that happened when trying to display non-printable characters in the code editor.
