|Issue ID
|Description

//CWP-50733 //PCSUP-18095
|tt:[Fixed in 31.01.123] 
//*Host Defender Deployment Erorr*
|Fixed an error in deploying and upgrading the Host Defenders on Windows Server 2019 installed on AWS.

//CWP-35771 //PCSUP-7591
|tt:[Fixed in 31.01.123] 
//*Node count for EKS clusters in Cloud discovery*
|Fixed an issue where node count was missing for EKS clusters under *Manage > Cloud accounts* cloud *Discovery* report. The correct node count is now displayed on the Console and in https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-cloud-discovery[API Cloud Discovery scan results].

//CWP-50923
|tt:[Fixed in 31.01.123]
//*AKS cluster names*
|Fixed an issue where AKS cluster names were not properly processed and the cluster was incorrectly classified as a generic Kubernetes cluster instead of an AKS cluster.
Now, the cluster names and their type are properly parsed as AKS clusters.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
//*Harbor support*
|Fixed an issue limiting the support of Prisma Cloud Compute as a pluggable scanner in Harbor.
The support is now extended to instances where the Defenders operate in a CRI environment.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
// *Missing version detection in JAR packages*
|Fixed an issue that caused missing version detection for jar packages when the version name included a date, for example, 20171018.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129]
// *Agentless Scanning for Azure - Error in onboarded Azure government accounts*
|Fixed an issue preventing agentless scanning of onboarded Azure government accounts

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
//*Agentless Scanning - Unable to scan containers when failing to list one container's details*
|Fixed an issue caused when listing container details of containers on hosts using Docker as the CRI. The issue led to agentless scanning not discovering containers on the specified host.
The fix improves the scan process tolerance to errors during the retrieval of containers metadata.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
// *Agentless Scanning - Missing OS labels of hosts scanned using agentless scanning*
|Added missing OS labels, both `osDistro` and `osVersion`, to hosts scanned by agentless scanning.

|tt:[Fixed in 31.00.129] 
// *Inconsistent reporting of AKS cluster names and type*
|Fixed an issue where AKS cluster names were not properly processed and the cluster was incorrectly classified as a generic Kubernetes cluster instead of an AKS cluster.
Now, the cluster names and their type are  properly parsed as AKS clusters.

//CWP-49610
|tt:[Fixed in 30.03.122]
|Due to a bug in Azure API, disks created by the agentless scanning process could potentially remain dangling (unattached). These disks are created with https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/delete?tabs=portal2%2Ccli3%2Cportal4%2Cportal5[Delete with VM] option which should ensure that they are deleted once the scanner VM has terminated.

Due to a bug in Azure API, the disks cleanup is not always guaranteed which leaves some disks under the `PCCAgentlessScanResourceGroup` as unattached.

This fix explicitly deletes any dangling disks after scanner instance termination as part of the cleanup phase at the end of the agentless scan cycle, thus ensuring no resources are left unattached.

//CWP-45391
|tt:[Fixed in 30.02.123]
|Fixed incorrect "Fix status" of the CVEs that originated from National Vulnerability Database (NVD). With this update, the "Fix status" for such CVEs remains empty when there is no fix available in the NVD, instead of calculating a wrong fix status.

//CWP-47729
|tt:[Fixed in 30.02.123]
|Fixed an issue with the Defenders and agentless scans detecting an incorrect Kubernetes version.
The Kubernetes version in the scan results on Prisma Console now matches the Kubernetes version that is installed on the host.

//CWP-45046
|tt:[Fixed in 30.02.123]
|Fixed a certificate error during the serverless scan in GCP when TLS proxy is enabled.
This was addressed by adding support for global proxy in GCP client.

//CWP-48075
|tt:[Fixed in 30.01.152]
|Addressed an issue that caused the Console to be unresponsive when a database restore was unsuccessful. With this fix, when the database restore fails, Console reverts the changes and falls back to the database state before the restore was initiated.

//CWP-27668
|tt:[Fixed in 30.01.152]
|Fixed incorrect CVE matching to the base layer for the binaries installed without a package manager.
There are differences in the results between an image created by Dockerfile and an image pulled by the registry. The vulnerabilities scan results attribute correctly to the base layer for the images built from a Dockerfile.

//GH#31220
|tt:[Fixed in 30.00.140]
|False "Passed" result caused when both alert threshold and failure threshold are off, with exceptions for specific CVEs. 
With this fix, exceptions set to fail now fail as expected, even when the thresholds are off.

//CWP-45454
|tt:[Fixed in 30.00.140]
|App-embedded Defender scan results display the removed or disconnected instances of the images.

//CWP-42650
|tt:[Fixed in 30.00.140]
|Missing Vulnerabilities of JARs on non-Maven Packages.

//CWP-42922
|tt:[Fixed in 30.00.140]
|Missing paths for Ruby packages in the scan results. 
With this fix, the package path in *Monitor > Vulnerabilities/Compliance > Images* helps you identify where the package is installed in your environment.

//CWP-46429
|tt:[Fixed in 30.00.140]
|Missing Vulnerabilities for Oracle Linux.

|*PCSUP-9241*  tt:[Fixed in 30.00.140]
// #39394
|For the AWS US Gov region, alerts are not forwarded successfully to the AWS Security Hub integration.
With this fix, the correct AWS product ARN for US and China regions are used.

|*PCSUP-11309*
//added Kepler Update 2
|The userinput:[--tarball] option in twistcli does not scan for compliance checks. Currently, only vulnerabilities are detected successfully.

|*—* 
// #22837
|Windows hosts running Defender are reported as unprotected. This issue occurs when Defender is installed on Windows hosts in AWS and Cloud Discovery is configured to scan your environment for protected hosts.


|*—* 
//25757
|If you have the same custom compliance rule in use in a host policy (effect: alert) and a container policy (effect: block), the rules will enforce your policy (as expected), but the audit message for a blocked container will incorrectly refer to the host policy and host rule name.


|*—* 
// #35634/35308
|On the menu:Radar[Containers], K3s clusters are not displayed when a Defender is deployed with an empty cluster name. You can view the containers within these clusters under *Non-cluster containers*.

|*—* 
// GH#42826
|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

|*PCSUP-12197*
// CWP-41449
|For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.

As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.

//GH#42826

|A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console.

//CWP-39278
|*-*
|Compliance check 6361 fails for hosts running RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
The check to ensure the `iptables` package is installed fails because `iptables` was deprecated in RHEL 9 and replaced with the `nftables` package.
