The Namespace Editor role will be removed in a future release.


|tt:[Deprecation Notice—Non-Standard Tag Names]
|With the 22.1.2 release, a standardized tag format is being introduced. See xref:features-introduced-in-microsegmentation-2022/features-introduced-in-microsegmentation-january-2022.adoc#ide1149dd5-03df-40d2-8359-6635412cff18[Features Introduced in January 2022]

All your existing tags will continue to be supported until further notice.

We recommend that you modify all your existing rulesets to use the new standardized tag format, to allow or deny communication and access to resources. This will enable you to be ready for the specific release where the new tag format will be enforced.
