|tt:[22.2.1] *Proxy Support*

+++<draft-comment>CNS-3317</draft-comment>+++
|If you have an explicit proxy in your environment, Enforcers can now establish connections to the backend through the explicit proxy.

While the connection is MTLS encrypted, when installing the Enforcer (menu:Network{sp}Security[Agent > Deploy]) you can configure it to accept a connection from a proxy that does not terminate TLS connections.
