=== Best practice

Document your install.
There is no difference between installing and upgrading the product.
Console is stateful, but it stores its state in a volume outside the container.
Defenders are stateless.
So upgrades simply require replacing the running containers with newer ones.

Many customers cannot recall how they installed Prisma Cloud when it comes time to upgrade months later.
When working on your first install, keep good notes about the parameters of your install.
You'll use them again when you upgrade Prisma Cloud.
