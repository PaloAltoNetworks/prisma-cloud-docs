== Plan

Plan how Prisma Cloud should be deployed to your environment.

image::ops_timeline_plan.png[width=850]

The first consideration is Console.
Console serves as both the management interface and the API.
Use it to define policy and monitor your environment.
When you deploy Prisma Cloud, install Console first.

The next consideration is Defender.
Defender enforces the policies you set in Console.
It must run on every host you want to secure.
Defender connects to Console over the network to retrieve policies and report data.

The big problems to solve in the planning phase are:

* Where should Console run?
* How many instances of Console should be deployed?
* Which hosts must be protected by Defender?
* How does Defender connect over the network to Console?


=== Concerns and constraints

Prisma Cloud can work within the constraints of almost any topology.
The placement of Console drives the design.
The discussion in following sections will help you assess your options and select the best deployment pattern.
Use one of the following deployment patterns as a starting point:

* 1 Console per environment.
* 1 Console for the production environment and 1 Console for all other environments (dev, test, staging, pre-prod, etc).
* 1 Console for all environments (also known as a "single pane of glass").
* Projects, which support multi-tenancy and/or very large scale environments (more than 5,000 hosts).


=== Enumerate your environments

An environment is a logical grouping of hosts, such as a cluster, that supports the execution of your app workload.
Here, environment is loosely defined because its scope can differ from organization to organization.
For example, a product group might have its own environment, segmented into dev, test, and prod.
A large organization might have separate such environments for each product group in a division.
Or it might simply classify everything as prod or non-prod that’s in two large environments shared across the organization.

The simplest deployment pattern calls for installing one Console per environment.
When you have many environments, however, this pattern is di cult to manage.
Projects, with it’s support for multi-tenancy, can help by allowing you to manage a large environment from one central Console.


=== Organizational and management structure

The relationship between your teams and your environments, along with who has authority to set policy, further constrains how you can deploy Prisma Cloud.

How do you separate the management of your different environments?
How much sharing between environments is there?
For example, if dev and prod are completely isolated from each other, then you could deploy one Console to each environment.
Alternatively, you could use Prisma Cloud’s native support for multi-tenancy (known as Projects) to deploy a supervisor Console to each environment, and manage access to each environment from single central Console.

What about security rules and policies?
Do the people managing each environment have the autonomy to configure their own rules?
If so, then the same patterns are applicable (one Console per environment, or multi-tenancy with projects).
If not, you could deploy a single Console to manage both environments.


=== Network topology

Your network topology also constrains the available options.
Defenders must be able to communicate with Console.
If a Defender can’t reach a Console, you might be forced to install a Console in that environment.
For example, an air-gapped environment would be forced to run a dedicated instance of Console.


=== Identity

Prisma Cloud supports integration with enterprise directory services and identity providers so that you can reuse existing users and groups to manage access to Console.
Which identity provider will you use?
How will you assign roles?
Prisma Cloud offers a number of preconfigured roles for the various personas that can interact with the tool.

==== Best practice

Deploy Prisma Cloud to at least one environment other than prod.
For example, consider running Prisma Cloud in both your prod and corresponding pre-prod (or staging) environment.
If you deploy Prisma Cloud to just your prod environment, then every change to Prisma Cloud (upgrades, new rules) could incapacitate a mission critical prod environment.
Instead, test and simulate changes in your pre-prod environment before rolling them out to your prod environment.

Prisma Cloud's license does not restrict the number of Consoles you can deploy.
You're free to run and operate as many Consoles as you like.
Currently, more than 3/4 of our customers deploy multiple Consoles.
