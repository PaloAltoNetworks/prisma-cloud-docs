=== Known issues

// #26088
* Defender containers in Defender DaemonSets still display as vulnerable after upgrade.
This happens because the auto-upgrade mechanism updates the Defender binary only, not the entire image, and the vulnerabilities exist in the image base layer.
To resolve the issue, redeploy all Defender DaemonSets.


=== Upcoming deprecations

Starting on June 14, 2021, we'll publish https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cwpp[API documentation] for our https://prisma.pan.dev/docs/cloud/cwpp/stable-endpoints[stable endpoints] only.

Stable endpoints have always been fully supported, and we have been committed to minimizing changes to them so that your integrations don't break when upgrading to newer versions of Compute.

Starting with our next release (codenamed Iverson), we'll further enhance how we support our API with versioned endpoints.
All stable endpoints will be versioned.
Versioned endpoints will be supported for the current release and the previous two releases (that is, Console will serve all three versions).
When you upgrade Compute, integrations can still access the endpoints from previous releases, so you can expect integrations to remain fully functional after upgrades, with full support across three major release cycles.
