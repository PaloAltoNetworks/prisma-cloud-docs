[#new-features-agentless-security]
=== New Features in Agentless Security

==== Support for Third-Party Packages on Windows

//CWP-46134	
This feature adds support for scanning vulnerabilities on third-party packages on Windows machines: `Node-Node.js`, `Python`, `Ruby-Gems`, `Java-JAR`, and `NuGet`.

==== Selective Scanning of Hosts with Include Tags
//CWP-46156
The new *Include hosts by tag* option allows you to select a subset of your hosts for scanning based on their tags. The tags interface is enhanced to help you view and manage your tags more easily.
Additionally, you can now use wildcards to exclude or include hosts that matach a certain tag pattern. For example, you can use `web-*` to include all hosts that have a tag starting with `web-`.

==== Agentless Scanning in Parallel Across Accounts and Regions
//CWP-44459
Adds the ability for Agentless scanning to scan accounts and regions within those accounts in parallel.
This capability will be a gradual roll out on all Prisma Cloud tenants.

Additional changes include:

* UI enhancements:

** You can now see specific account status (for example, scanning and completed), and accounts by that status

** The cloud accounts page now shows the general scan progress instead of the progress bar

* Hub account related changes:

** Hub account is now treated as an account dedicated for Agentless scanning and hence will be used to only scan other accounts

** Scan related configuration are done centrally on the hub account configuration and not required to be duplicated across all target accounts. As an example, networking configuration can only be set on the hub account.

[#addressed-issues]
=== Addressed Issues

//CWP-48075
* Addressed an issue, wherein the Console would hang due to a failed database restore. Now, when the database restore fails, the Console will revert the changes and fallback to the database state it had before the restore started.

//CWP-27668
* Fixed incorrect CVE matching to the base layer for the binaries installed without a package manager.
There are differences in the results between an image created by Dockerfile and an image pulled by the registry. The vulnerabilities scan results attribute correctly to the base layer for the images built from a Dockerfile.
