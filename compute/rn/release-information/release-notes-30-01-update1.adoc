[#new-features-agentless-security]
=== New Features in Agentless Security

==== Support for Third-Party Packages on Windows

//CWP-46134	
This feature adds support for scanning vulnerabilities on third-party packages on Windows machines: `Node-Node.js`, `Python`, `Ruby-Gems`, `Java-JAR`, and `NuGet`.

==== Selective Scanning of Hosts with Include Tags
//CWP-46156
The new *Include hosts by tag* option allows you to select a subset of your hosts for scanning based on their tags. The tags interface is enhanced to help you view and manage your tags more easily.
Additionally, you can now use wildcards to exclude or include hosts that match a certain tag pattern. For example, you can use `web-*` to include all hosts that have a tag starting with `web-`.

==== UI Enhancements
//CWP-44459

* You can now see specific account statuses (for example, scanning and completed) and sort accounts by that status.

* The cloud accounts page now shows the general scan progress instead of the progress bar.

==== Hub Account Changes

* Hub account is now treated as an account dedicated for Agentless scanning and hence will be used to only scan other accounts.

* Scan related configurations are done centrally on the hub account configuration and are not required to be duplicated across all target accounts. As an example, you can set networking configuration only on the hub account.

==== Agentless scanning in AWS: Specify a subnet and use a private IP

You can now specify a subnet name and use a private IP from that subnet to report the agentless scanning results back to Prisma Cloud.

[#addressed-issues]
=== Addressed Issues

//CWP-48075
* Addressed an issue that caused the Console to be unresponsive when a database restore was unsuccessful. With this fix, when the database restore fails, Console reverts the changes and falls back to the database state before the restore was initiated.

//CWP-27668
* Fixed incorrect CVE matching to the base layer for the binaries installed without a package manager.
There are differences in the results between an image created by Dockerfile and an image pulled by the registry. The vulnerabilities scan results attribute correctly to the base layer for the images built from a Dockerfile.

=== End of Support Notifications
//CWP-46828
