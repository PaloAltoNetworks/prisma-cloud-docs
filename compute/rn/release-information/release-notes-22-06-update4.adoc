=== Addressed Issues

//GH#42846 No asset record on Asset Explorer view for EKS app embd asset

//GH#42572 PCSUP-12237 | [WAAS][Credits] Credits calculated based on disconnected Defenders
// To be verified by Elad and @ngans on the ticket
Fixed an error in the the credit usage utilization for WAAS. With this fix, when container Defenders are disconnected for 24 hours the credits usage is automatically stopped until the Defenders reconnect.

// GH#42423 related to #42289
// To be verified by @bhayuny
Improved the user experience with setting the collection scope in runtime policy rules. If you have a large number ( greater than 6000 ) collections, the time to view the list of collections and set the scope in the policy is improved.

//Alternate blurb to be verified by @bhayuny
Setting the collection scope for greater than 6000 collections under runtime policy rules would freeze, this is now fixed.
