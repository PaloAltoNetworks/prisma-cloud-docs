Now when the APIs for the service are disabled on the CSP, cloud discovery or registry scanning do not display these as errors in scan results. 
The messages are added to the console logs.

* Fixed an issue with incorrect cluster information in image scan results on "Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Deployed".

In addition, you were unable to save an Out-of-Band WAAS rule with a scope that includes a namespace selection, or does not include an image selection.
These issues are fixed.

=== Upcoming breaking changes

* Intelligence Stream
TBD
//As part of this release, Prisma Cloud has rolled out an update to the vulnerability data stream for https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36085[CVE-2022-36085]. After updating to the enhanced intelligence feed, you may see alerts on vulnerabilities in Prisma Cloud components and Defender images of releases 22.06 Update 1 or older versions. We have determined that Prisma Cloud components are not impacted by these vulnerabilities. There is no risk to continue running any of the supported Prisma Cloud releases.

// To ensure these vulnerability alerts do not display, we recommend upgrading to the latest 22.06 release where applicable. If you are not ready to upgrade right away, add an exception in the default Ignore Twistlock Components rule (under Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Deployed) to suppress these vulnerability alerts.
