//GH#40694	PCSUP-10618	
* Fixed an issue where errors were reported in scan results when the cloud service provider APIs are disabled.
+
Now when the APIs for the service are disabled on the CSP, cloud discovery or registry scanning do not display these as errors in scan results. 
The messages are added to the console logs.

//GH#40533	PCSUP-10621	
* Fixed an issue with incorrect cluster information in image scan results on "Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Deployed".

//GH#38960		
* When adding a new Out-of-Band WAAS rule, you were unable to select a container name in the rule scope.
+
In addition, you were unable to save an Out-of-Band WAAS rule with a scope that includes a namespace selection, or does not include an image selection.
These issues are fixed.

=== Upcoming Breaking Changes

* *Intelligence Stream*
//GH#83003
+
As part of the upcoming feature release (Lagrange), the Intelligence Stream is being updated to include additional and enhanced risk factor data.
With this IS update, if you are on Prisma Cloud Compute Edition v22.06, you must upgrade to Kepler Update 3, before the Lagrange release targeted for early December 2022.
+
The upgrade to Kepler Update 3 is required to ensure that you continue to receive the latest vulnerability data from the Palo Alto Networks CDN.


// GH#40768
* *Alert Profile*
+
On upgrade to the upcomimg release (Lagrange), if you have configured an alert profile on "Compute > Manage > Alerts" and enabled the *Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed) trigger* as well as the *Immediately alert for deployed resources* setting, you will now be getting immediate alerts for vulnerable registry images along with immediate alerts for deployed images.
+
image::immediate-alert-registry-images.png[width=400]
+
The volume of immediate alerts that are generated may be much higher than what you've seen in the previous releases because support for immediate alerting for registry images is being added in Lagrange. With this change, the Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed) option is being separated into two: Deployed images vulnerabilities and Registry images vulnerabilities, and both these triggers will be enabled if the original trigger was enabled in the alert profile.
