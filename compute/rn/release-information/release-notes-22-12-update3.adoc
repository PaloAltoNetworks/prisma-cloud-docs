[#upgrade-path]
=== Upgrade Path to 22.12.694

If you are running a Prisma Cloud console version 22.06 or earlier, you must first upgrade the console to 22.12.585 and then to 22.12.694.

[#cve-coverage-update]
=== CVE Coverage Update

//CWP-46080

* Fixed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25173[CVE-2023-25173] and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25153[CVE-2023-25153] (Severity - Moderate): the `containerd` package is used in the Prisma Cloud Defender and for Agentless Scanning. To address the vulnerability, upgrade to `containerd` version v1.6.18 or v1.5.18 as needed.

* Fixed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1996[CVE-2022-1996] (Severity - Critical) is included in the Intelligence Stream feed. The Go-Restful package is a transitive dependency that is pulled with http://k8s.io/client-go[k8s.io/client-go] and http://k8s.io/kube-openapi[k8s.io/kube-openapi] and is not being used directly in the Compute Defender and Console, thus it is suppressed.

[#enhancements]
=== Enhancements

//CWP-45310

* Defender Upgrade All Improvements- When you select to Upgrade all Defenders (*Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders*), you can only upgrade the Defenders that are eligible for the upgrade and for which you have the permission to upgrade, based on the collections that are assigned to your Prisma Cloud role. A confirmation dialog displays to confirm the upgrade. This change applies to upgrades for Host and Single Container Defenders on Linux and Windows.

//CWP-45932

* Improved testing to support the automatic updates of GKE Autopilot clusters.
The latest three Prisma Cloud releases are tested daily using the latest GKE Autopilot version for continued support.

//CWP-41081

* Added support to scan images and containers running on cloud hosts in the supported Oracle Cloud environments.

[#bug-fixes]
=== Addressed Issues

//CWP-46005 CWP-46353
* The count of events for WAAS agentless did not correspond to the actual number of attack requests sent, this is now fixed.

//CWP-45194
* Fixed an API Discovery issue where https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/waas/waas_api_discovery#_inspect_discovered_endpoints[API endpoints discovered] on app-embedded deployments were missing workload value and were showing zero vulnerabilities when the protected workload had vulnerabilities.

//CWP-46099
* On upgrading from 22.06 to 22.12.415, the compliance policy rules configured to "Block" effect fail the creation and edition of policies. This issue is fixed in 22.12.694, the "Block" effect for these compliance policies is disabled and set to "Alert" effect under *Defend > Compliance > Containers and images > Deployed > Add rule*.
