=== Enhancements
// GithubIssue PCSUP-issue#

// GH#39229
==== HTTPS Proxy Support for Agentless Scanning

* Agentless scanning now supports connections over an HTTPS proxy server.  If you use custom certificates for authentication, you can now configure custom certificates for the connection to Console when using https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/configure/configure-agentless-scanning[agentless scanning].

// GH# 39754
==== Embed a Defender in a CloudFormation Fargate Task in YAML format
* Prisma Cloud Compute now supports embedding a Defender to a CloudFormation Fargate task in the YAML format, in addition to the JSON format.
+
Also, Prisma Cloud now supports generating a protected Fargate task definition for a full CloudFormation template that contains other resources except for the task definition itself.
+
Use the Console (Manage > Defenders > Deploy > Defenders) or the APIs (/api/22.06/defenders/fargate.yaml, /api/22.06/defenders/fargate.json) to complete the workflow.

// GH#39262
==== Support for Additional Orchestrators on x86 Architecture
  
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) version 1.24.2 with containerd version 1.6.6

* Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) version 1.23.9 with containerd version 1.6.6

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) version 1.24.3 with containerd version 1.6.4+azure-4 running on Linux

* AKS version 1.24.3 running with containerd version 1.6.6+azure on Windows

* Lightweight Kubernetes (k3s) version v1.24.4+k3s1 with containerd 1.6.6-k3s1

* Openshift version 4.11 with CRIO 1.24.1

* Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) version 1.24.4+rke2r1 with containerd 1.6.6-k3s1

//GH#39872
==== Name Update for Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF) 
The Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF) is now renamed as Cloud Native Network Segmentation (CNNS). 


=== Addressed Issues

// GH#40449 PCSUP-10632
* Fixed an issue that caused Defender to incorrectly report the Host OS as SLES15SP1 instead of SLES15.

// GH#40673 #PCSUP-10988  #PCSUP-1940
* Fixed an internal error that failed to refresh the vulnerability statistics under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer*.

// GH#32310 PCSUP-10507
* Fixed two issues with Defenders running on containerd/CRI-O nodes:

** Defenders attempted to scan host file systems during image scans for containers that changed to the host mount namespace. This issue is fixed.

** Defenders attempted to scan the host filesystem as some parent directory was pointing to host directories. This was fixed by detecting the correct mount points.

// GH#40515 PCSUP-10791
* Fixed an issue that prevented editing WAAS rules. On upgrade to 22.06, it was not possible to update or modify WAAS rules configured to protect the same port at multiple endpoints with different attributes, such as TLS, HTTP2, and gRPC.
With this fix, such rules can now be modified.

// GH#40525 PCSUP-10552
* Fixed the *"Missing required VM instance data"* error encountered during agentless scanning on Azure.
Azure hosts with unmanaged operating system disks are skipped during the scan.
Agentless scanning doesn't support Azure hosts with an unmanaged operating system disk.

// GH#40607	PCSUP-10655

* Fixed a high memory usage issue in Linux distributions where CNNF/CNNS was enabled. In addition to upgrading to this release, CNNF/CNNS users are advised to upgrade 4.15.x kernel to >=5.4.x kernel.

=== Known Issues
// GH# PCSUP-
// GH#39394	PCSUP-9241
* Prisma Cloud integration with AWS Security Hub fails on US government regions.

=== End of Support Notifications

// GH#38468
* With the end of support for Maven system dependencies, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender[Defender injection for java functions] is now implemented using the bundle as a Maven internal repository. With this update, `<systemPath>` dependency is no longer used. 

// GH#39984
* With the end of support for compile dependency in Gradle 7.0, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender[Defender injection for java functions] is updated to implementation dependency using an internal repository.

=== Upcoming breaking changes

// GH#40768
On upgrade to the next release, Lagrange, if you have configured an alert profile on *Compute > Manage > Alerts* and enabled the *Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed) trigger* as well as the *Immediately alert for deployed resources* setting, you will now be getting immediate alerts for vulnerable registry images along with immediate alerts for deployed images.

image::immediate-alert-registry-images.png[width=400]

The volume of immediate alerts that are generated may be much higher than what you've seen in the previous releases because support for immediate alerting for registry images is being added in Lagrange. With this change, the Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed) option is being separated into two: Deployed images vulnerabilities and Registry images vulnerabilities, and both these triggers will be enabled if the original trigger was enabled in the alert profile.
