=== Enhancements
// GithubIssue PCSUP-issue#

// GH#39229
==== HTTPS Proxy Support for Agentless Scanning

* Agentless scanning now supports connections over an HTTPS proxy server.  If you use custom certificates for authentication, you can now configure custom certificates for the connection to Console when using https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/configure/configure-agentless-scanning[agentless scanning].

// GH# 39754
==== Embed a Defender in a CloudFormation Fargate Task in YAML format
* Prisma Cloud Compute now supports embedding a Defender to a CloudFormation Fargate task in the YAML format, in addition to the JSON format.
+
Also, Prisma Cloud now supports generating a protected Fargate task definition for a full CloudFormation template that contains other resources except for the task definition itself.
+
Use the Console (Manage > Defenders > Deploy > Defenders) or the APIs (/api/22.06/defenders/fargate.yaml, /api/22.06/defenders/fargate.json) to complete the workflow.

// GH#39262

//GH#39872
==== Name Update for Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF) 
The Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF) is now renamed as Cloud Native Network Segmentation (CNNS). 


=== Addressed Issues

// GH#40449 PCSUP-10632
* Fixed an issue that caused Defender to incorrectly report the Host OS as SLES15SP1 instead of SLES15.

// GH#40673 #PCSUP-10988  #PCSUP-1940
* Fixed an internal error that failed to refresh the vulnerability statistics under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Vulnerability Explorer*.

// GH#39394	PCSUP-9241
* Fixed an explicit deny error when sending a test alert to the AWS Security Hub integration. With this fix, the correct AWS product ARN for US and China regions are used.

// GH#32310 PCSUP-10507
Fixed two issues with Defenders running on containerd/CRI-O nodes:
* Defenders attempted to scan host file systems during image scans for containers that changed to the host mount namespace. This issue is fixed.
* Defenders attempted to scan the host filesystem as some parent directory was a symlink. The issue was fixed by ignoring the image scans running from the host namespace to avoid false binary detections.

// GH#40515 PCSUP-10791
Fixed an issue that prevented editing WAAS rules. On upgrade to 22.06, it was not possible to update or modify WAAS rules configured to protect the same port at multiple endpoints with different attributes, such as TLS, HTTP2, and gRPC.
With this fix, such rules can now be modified.

// GH#40525 PCSUP-10552
Fixed a missing required VM instance data error for agentless scanning on Azure.
Agentless scanning doesn't support Azure hosts without a managed operating system disk.
Such hosts are marked without failing and skipped during the scan.

=== Known Issues
// GH# PCSUP-

=== End of Support Notifications

// GH#38468
* With the end of support for Maven system dependencies, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender[Defender injection for java functions] is now implemented using the bundle as a Maven internal repository. With this update, `<systemPath>` dependency is no longer used. 

// GH#39984
* With the end of support for compile dependency in Gradle 7.0, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender[Defender injection for java functions] is updated to implementation dependency using an internal repository.

=== Upcoming breaking changes

// GH#40768
On upgrade to the next release, Lagrange, if you have configured an alert profile on *Compute > Manage > Alerts* and enabled the *Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed) trigger* as well as the *Immediately alert for deployed resources* setting, you will now be getting immediate alerts for vulnerable registry images along with immediate alerts for deployed images.

image::immediate-alert-registry-images.png[width=400]

The volume of immediate alerts that are generated may be much higher than what you've seen in the previous releases because support for immediate alerting for registry images is being added in Lagrange. With this change, the Image vulnerabilities (registry and deployed) option is being separated into two: Deployed images vulnerabilities and Registry images vulnerabilities, and both these triggers will be enabled if the original trigger was enabled in the alert profile.
