// GH#39668 #PCSUP-9482

// GH#39821 On-prem only
* Fixed the validity period error of https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/configure/certificates[self-signed certificates]. The limit of 365 has been waved off and the value can now be a whole number greater than or equal to 1.

[#known-issue]
=== Known Issues

// GH#39682 PCSUP-9275
* Defenders are not accepting the self-signed proxy certificate configured for TLS intercept proxies. 
+
*Workaround*: Ensure the following conditions are met to workaround the issue.
+
** Your proxy trusts the Prisma Cloud Console Certificate Authority (CA).
** Your proxy uses the client certificate of the Defender when the proxy sends requests from the Defender to the console.
** You obtained the certificates of the Defender and the Prisma Cloud Console CA. Use the `/api/v1/certs/server-certs.sh` API to obtain the needed files: 
*** The client key of the Defender: `defender-client-key.pem`
*** The client certificate of the Defender: `defender-client-cert.pem` 
*** The Prisma Cloud Console CA certificate: `ca.pem`
** You obtained the password for the client key of the Defender using the `api/v1/certs/service-parameter` API.
