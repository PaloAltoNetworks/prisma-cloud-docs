=== Known Issues

// GH#39682 PCSUP-9275
* Defenders are not accepting the self-signed proxy certificate configured for TLS intercept proxies. 
+
*Workaround*: Ensure the following conditions are met to workaround the issue.
+
** Your proxy trusts the Prisma Cloud Console Certificate Authority (CA).
** Your proxy uses the client certificate of the Defender when the proxy sends requests from the Defender to the console.
** You obtained the certificates of the Defender and the Prisma Cloud Console CA. Use the `/api/v1/certs/server-certs.sh` API to obtain the needed files: 
*** The client key of the Defender: `defender-client-key.pem`
*** The client certificate of the Defender: `defender-client-cert.pem` 
*** The Prisma Cloud Console CA certificate: `ca.pem`
** You obtained the password for the client key of the Defender using the `api/v1/certs/service-parameter` API.
