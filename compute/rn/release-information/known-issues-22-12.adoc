//CWP-44683 | Moved to Maxwell? The Fix version changed on 22 Feb, 2023 on the ticket
* tt:[22.12.582] The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/waas/waas_api_discovery[API discovery] database has an optimal size, beyond which the path entries that have not been accessed for the longest time will be removed.

//CWP-46005 known issue - this will be fixed in 22.13.xxx Lagrange Update 3

//CWP-45194 known issue - this will be fixed in 22.13.xxx Lagrange Update 3
* tt:[22.12.582] The https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/waas/waas_api_discovery#_inspect_discovered_endpoints[API endpoints discovered] on App-embedded deployments are missing workload values and show zero vulnerabilities, although the protected workload has vulnerabilites.

//CWP-44668 - validated by Elad/Matangi on the ticket + Add this as a known issue in 22.12 file

//CWP-44743

Workaround: Manually add exceptions to rules. Click the *Rule app ID* on the "Aggregated WAAS Events" page and edit the relevant detection.
+
This issue is fixed in 22.12.582.

//CWP-43836 GH##41137
* tt:[22.12.415 and 22.12.427] The console displays an expired certificate warning for Defenders even if the certificate is not in use. This issue only occurs when you have certificates that are more than 3 years old.
+
Confirm that the Defenders are connected and ignore the UI notification banner.
+
*Workaround*: Delete the `*.pem.old` certficate to remove this UI notification banner.
+
This issue is fixed in 22.12.582.

//GH#39394 PCSUP-9241
* tt:[22.12.415 or later] Prisma Cloud integration with AWS Security Hub fails on US Gov regions.

//GH#42826
* tt:[22.12.415 or later] A `404 Not Found error` is displayed when performing a sandbox image analysis using older version of twistcli, such as v22.06, with the 22.12 console. 

//CWP-39278
* Compliance check 6361 fails for hosts running RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.
The check to ensure the `iptables` package is installed fails because `iptables` was deprecated in RHEL 9 and replaced with the `nftables` package.

//PCSUP-12197/CWP-41449
* For an application that originates from an OS package, the vulnerability data for CVEs is sourced from the relevant feed for the OS package. In some cases, like with Amazon Linux and Photon OS, this CVE information is provided in security advisories such as Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) for Amazon, and PHSA for Photon. In such cases, the correlation for the relevant vulnerabilities is limited.
As an example, when the application “python” is sourced from an Amazon Python package, CVEs found for the python application (as a binary) will not be correlated with the relevant Amazon CVEs from the ALAS.
