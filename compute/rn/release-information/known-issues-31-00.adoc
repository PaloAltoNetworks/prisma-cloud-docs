== 31.00 Known Issues

Review the list of known issues on the 31.00 release.

=== Fixed Issues

==== Fixed Harbor support

Fixed an issue limiting the support of Prisma Cloud Compute as a pluggable scanner in Harbor.
The support is now extended to instances where the Defenders operate in a CRI environment.

==== Fixed Missing version detection in JAR packages

Fixed an issue that caused missing version detection for jar packages when the version name included a date, for example, 20171018.

==== Agentless Scanning for Azure - Fixed error in onboarded Azure government accounts

Fixed an issue preventing agentless scanning of onboarded Azure government accounts

==== Agentless Scanning - Fixed being unable to scan containers when failing to list one container's details

Fixed an issue caused when listing container details of containers on hosts using Docker as the CRI. The issue led to agentless scanning not discovering containers on the specified host.
The fix improves the scan process tolerance to errors during the retrieval of containers metadata.

==== Agentless Scanning - Fixed missing OS labels of hosts scanned using agentless scanning

Added missing OS labels, both `osDistro` and `osVersion`, to hosts scanned by agentless scanning.

==== Inconsistent reporting of AKS cluster names and type

Fixed an issue where AKS cluster names were not properly processed and the cluster was incorrectly classified as a generic Kubernetes cluster instead of an AKS cluster.
Now, the cluster names and their type are  properly parsed as AKS clusters.
