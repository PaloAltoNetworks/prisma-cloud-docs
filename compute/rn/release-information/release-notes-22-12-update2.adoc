=== Enhancements

//CWP-36621
* Added support for cgroupv2:

** *Scans*:
*** Full support for cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.
*** Hybrid mode not supported: this will not fail the scan, but the scan will run without the process limitation protection.

** *WAAS*:
*** In-Line firewall:
- Full support for cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.
- Hybrid mode: partially supported. It is supported if the memory and CPU controllers are both under the legacy hierarchy (v1). Otherwise, the firewall will fail.

*** Out-Of-Band firewall:
- Only cgroup v1 is fully supported.
- Cgroup v2: not supported. The firewall will run but the memory limit of the defender's cgroup will not be increased.
- Hybrid mode: partially supported. Same as WAAS In-Line.

** *Console deployment*:
*** Not supported in cgroup v2. The console can run on cgroup v2, but the stat periodic process will fail to run and will log an error to the console log.

** cgroup v2 is not supported for Talos and other Operating Systems, as both don't have `Systemd`.
