[#cve-coverage-update]
=== CVE Coverage Update

//CWP- 45155 and CWP- 45090
* Fixed https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1144[CVE-2022-41717] and https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0969[CVE-2022-27664]: Updated the `golang.org/x/net` Go module to v0.5.0.
WAAS deployments were affected if you have a HTTP2 applications and have deployed WAAS to inspect HTTP2 traffic.
Upgrade your Prisma Cloud console and deployed Defenders if you use WAAS to inspect HTTP2 traffic.

* Fixed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0247[CVE-2023-0247]: Updated the `bits-and-blooms/bloom` Go module to v3.3.1.

* https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1495[CVE-2022-41721] is included in the Intelligence Stream feed. Prisma Cloud doesn't use `MaxBytesHandler` and this vulnerability doesn't impact Prisma Cloud components.
You can continue to run any of the supported Prisma Cloud releases without risk from this vulnerability.
To remove the vulnerability alert, upgrade to the latest 22.12 release.
If you are not ready to upgrade right away, add an exception in the default *Ignore Twistlock Components* rule.
Go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Deployed* to add the exception to suppress the vulnerability alerts for CVE-2022-41721.

//CWP-45741
* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1996[CVE-2022-1996] is included in the Intelligence Stream feed.
The Go-Restful package is a transitive dependency that is pulled with `k8s.io/client-go` and `k8s.io/kube-openapi` and is not being used directly in the Compute Defender and Console, thus it is suppressed.

* The `ubi-minimal` base image's packages are updated to the latest.

[#enhancements]
=== Enhancements

//CWP-36621
* Added support for cgroupv2:

** *Scans*:
*** Full support for cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.
*** Hybrid mode not supported: this will not fail the scan, but the scan will run without the process limitation protection.

** *WAAS*:
*** In-Line firewall:
- Full support for cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.
- Hybrid mode: partially supported. It is supported if the memory and CPU controllers are both under the legacy hierarchy (v1). Otherwise, the firewall will fail.

*** Out-Of-Band firewall:
- Only cgroup v1 is fully supported.
- Cgroup v2: not supported. The firewall will run but the memory limit of the defender's cgroup will not be increased.
- Hybrid mode: partially supported. Same as WAAS In-Line.

** *Console deployment*:
*** Not supported in cgroup v2. The console can run on cgroup v2, but the stat periodic process will fail to run and will log an error to the console log.

** cgroup v2 is not supported for Talos and other Operating Systems, as both don't have `Systemd`.

Added a log in cases when during image scan, the package manager folders required for the scan (e.g, /var/lib/dpkg) don't exist. The log will appear either in the Defender logs or twistcli stdout.
In these cases, the scan might end with 0 vulnerabilities for this image.
