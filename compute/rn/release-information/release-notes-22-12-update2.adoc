=== Enhancements

[NOTE]
====
- From Rodrigo: We have a single section with all enhancements since we are not shipping a lot of features. Is the "Enhancements" heading agreeable to all?
We also have two issues listing addressed vulnerabilities in twistlock but it isn't clear what the message for customers needs to be. I added the information I have but please advise and provide the details that internal and external customers need to know. Should we include the CVE fixes under Enhancements, fixed issues, or its own CVE Coverage section?
