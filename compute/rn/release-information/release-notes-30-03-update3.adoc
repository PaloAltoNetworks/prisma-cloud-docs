//CWP-47358
==== Package URL (pURL) Format Support for Vulnerabilities

Prisma Cloud now adds package URLs (pURL) for packages and vulnerabilities while https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/tools/twistcli_scan_images[scanning the images using twistcli]. This helps to reliably reference the same software package using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.

As you scan images with `twistcli`, you can filter the CVEs based on the pURL format in the CVE viewer.

==== Scan errors visibility improvements - accounts/ region error scope

Introducing Enhanced Issue Visibility: To get the most out of agentless scanning, this update categorizes issues during the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/30/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning[agentless scan process], provides detailed information on their nature, source, and troubleshooting steps, and offers a seamless user interface experience. Easily understand and resolve issues, improving scan coverage and streamlining your scanning process.
Go to *Compute > Monitor > Vulnerabilities or Compliance* and select the *Hosts or Images* tab to check the prisma/prisma-cloud/30/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning-results[agentless scan results].

//CWP-48291
==== Added Support for Parallel Agentless Scans of Accounts and Regions

Updated the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/30/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning#scanning-process[agentless scanning process] to scan accounts and regions within those accounts in parallel.

==== Registry Settings API supports GitLab Container Registry

Starting with 30.03, you no longer need to add GitLab Container Registry through Docker V2 registry which required administrative permissions to scan all images.

You can now directly add GitLab Container Registry in the `POST, settings/registry` endpoint by using the new schema `gitlabRegistrySpec` in the request body.

To add, you must specify the following parameters:

* *version*:  Specify the value *gitlab* for GitLab Container Registry.
* *registry*: Specify the GitLab registry URL address. Example, for native registries, you can specify the address as "https://registry.gitlab.com" 
* *credentialID*: Specify the GitLab credential that you added in the credential store in Prisma Cloud Compute. For example, an API token that has atleast the *read_api* scope.
* *gitlabRegistrySpec*: Specify at least one of the following fields:

    * *userID*: Specify your GitLab user ID to add all registries associated with it.
    * *projectIDs*: Specify the project IDs to add all registries associated with a GitLab project.
    * *groupIDs*: Specify the group ID to add all registries associated with a GitLab group.
    * *excludedGroupIDs*: Specify the top-level group IDs that you don't want to add.

*Old (30.02 and earlier releases)* 

Example request body schema:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version": "2",
    "registry": "",
    "credentialID": "<GitLab Token>",
    "repository": "library/ubuntu",
    "tag": "16.04",
    "os": "linux",
    "cap": 5,
    "scanners": 2,
    "collections": ["All"]
}
----

*New (in release 30.03)*

Example request body schema showing *gitlabRegistrySpec* that contains the *userID* to add and scan all registries associated with it:

[source,json]
----
{
    "version":"gitlab",
    "registry":"https://registry.gitlab.com",
    "namespace":"",
    "repository":"",
    "tag":"",
    "credentialID":"<GitLab Token>",
    "os":"linux",
    "harborDeploymentSecurity":false,
    "collections":["All"],
    "cap":5,
    "scanners":2,
    "versionPattern":"",
    "gitlabRegistrySpec":{"userID":"14631394"}
}

//CWP-49610
* Fixed an issue in Azure API that left the disks created by the agentless scanning process in a dangling state once the scanner VM was terminated.
