=== DISA STIG scan findings and justifications

Every release, we perform an SCAP scan of the Prisma Cloud Compute Console and Defender images.
The process is based upon the U.S. Air Force’s Platform 1 https://repo1.dso.mil/ironbank-tools/ironbank-pipeline/-/blob/master/stages/scanning/oscap-compliance-run.sh["Repo One" OpenSCAP scan] of the Prisma Cloud Compute images.
We compare our scan results to https://ironbank.dso.mil/about[IronBank’s] latest approved UBI8-minimal scan findings.
Any discrepancies are addressed or justified.

[#_breaking_changes]
=== Breaking changes

Be aware of the following breaking changes when upgrading to 21.04:

// #24602
* For Fargate and App-Embedded Defenders: Until this release, Prisma Cloud kept the task running if the connectivity to Console failed because of corrupt installation bundles (we just log and run the task anyway).
Now, if a task is failing or is in an error state, Prisma Cloud doesn't allow connections back to Console.

// #20768
* Compliance Explorer has been refactored to make it easier to understand how your environments, and segments of your environment, comply to policy.
Because the structure of the data has changed, existing compliance statistics will be deleted on upgrade.
Also:
** CSV export for the main table have changed according to the new table structure.
** CSV export for the compliance check dialog table have changed.
The CSV will be taken from the download API for images, containers, hosts, and serverless pages.
** Compliance metrics in Radar's sidebar have been updated to align with the new data and structure in Compliance Explorer.
** Istio compliance checks opened from Compliance explorer don't have a list of affected resources in the dialog.

// #27074
* Prometheus compliance fields have changed.
Up until this release, Prisma Cloud had metrics by impacted resources (e.g. images_critical_compliance).
Now we provide the total number of failed checks by severity.
The new metrics are:
** `low_compliance` - Total number of low severity failed compliance checks.
** `medium_compliance` - Total number of medium severity failed compliance checks.
** `high_compliance` - Total number of high severity failed compliance checks.
** `critical_compliance` - Total number of critical severity failed compliance checks.

// #23922
* The JSON file output from twistcli image scans has the following schema changes:
** Publish date - name changed, date format instead of days.
** Discovered date - name changed, date format instead of days.
** Risk factors - string array instead of an empty JSON format.

// #23922
* The twistcli flag `--include-package-files` has been deprecated and removed.

// #29049
* If you're using Kubernetes auditing, you must redeploy the AuditSink after upgrading.
Console's certificate might be renewed during upgrade, so your cluster won't be able to send audits to Prisma Cloud Console.

// #28359
* Starting with this release, only users with the administrator role can download debug logs and create backups.
The operator and auditor roles can no longer perform these actions.
The artifacts from these actions contain sensitive information that could be used to escalate privileges in Prisma Cloud.
Only admins can:
** Download debug logs from *Manage > Logs > Console*.
** Create backups from *Manage > System > Backup & restore*.

// #28237
* The _Access User_ role lost all of its permissions, except access to some generally available API endpoints that are open to all authenticated users.
Access Users will no longer be able to login to the Console UI.
This role will be removed in the next release.
As a reminder, the Access User role was originally designed for users to install certificates as part of a mechanism to control access to Docker commands.

// #17804
* Defender Manager user role (Mapped to "Cloud Provisioning Admin" permission group on SaaS) will no longer be able to perform CI scans. 

// #19679
* As part of the work to introduce the new ATT&CK dashboard, all audits will be discarded on upgrade.

// #23839
* Installations using legacy host based licensing will not have the WAAS feature available

//#23776
* Due to reuse of network ranges in customer VPCs defenders on different clusters have the same name therefore host names were renamed.
Therefore, upon defender upgrade the old defender will appear at console as disconnected until automatically removed by the console. The upgraded defender will appear under it's new format name. Note: if the old defender(s) was specifically selected for registry scan, it will be needed to be reselected with their updated name 
New format names listed below:
** AWS format: hostname => hostname-unique AWS instance ID
For example: ip-172-31-80-18.ec2.internal => ip-172-31-80-18.ec2.internal-i-07dca3f58ecf1e48a
** Azure format: hostname => hostname-custom resource group name-subscription ID
For example: aks-agentpool-16678185-vmss000000 => aks-agentpool-16678185-vmss000000-MC_alexs-aks_alexs-aks_eastus-ae02981e-e1bd-49ec-ad81-801f157a944e

//#26088
* Customers using automatic upgrade of defender may see vulnerabiliteis reported on their defenders. This is due to the fact that the automatic upgrade replaces the binary during  while the vulenabilit(ies) exist on the base layer. In order to fix this, manual upgrade of the defenders will need to be performed  


=== Breaking changes in the API

For complete information about breaking changes and deprecated endpoints in the API, see the https://prisma.pan.dev/docs/cloud/cwpp/porting-guide/[21.04 API porting guide].


=== Deprecated this release

// #23566
* The _Registry scanner_ role for Defenders has been deprecated and removed.
Starting this release, Defenders are selected to perform registry scanning based on collections.
To determine which Defenders are part of the scanner pool, filter the table in *Manage > Defenders > Manage > Defenders* by collection.

// #26112
* The *Roles* column in the table in *Manage > Defenders > Manage > Defenders* has been deprecated and removed.
Defenders can no longer have the *Registry scanner* role (see above).
Also, the table already contains data to show if a Defender has the *Docker proxy* role.
See the *Listerner type* column in the table in *Manage > Defenders > Manage > Defenders*.
If listener type is set to *TCP Socket*, Defender acts as a Docker proxy.

// #23566
* Compliance check 420, _Image is not updated to latest_, has been deprecated and removed from the product.

// #25866
* As part of the work to improve runtime support for App-Embedded Defenders, explicitly denied lists in App-Embedded runtime rules have been deprecated.
By default, everything is denied unless explicitly allow-listed.


=== Upcoming deprecations

* The *Access User* role will be deprecated in the next release (code-named Iverson).
