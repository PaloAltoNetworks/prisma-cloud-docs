==== Severity Based Actions for Packages in Vulnerability Rules

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/31/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/vuln_management_rules[Vulnerability policy rules] can now be scoped based on the severity threshold per package, in addition to scoping the vulnerabilities by collections.
You can now define the severity threshold per package type for alert and block actions.

The package type severity thresholds apply to all workload types: deployed images, CI Images, hosts, VM images, functions, and CI Functions.

With this feature, you can monitor alerts at a granular level and focus on vulnerabilities in specific packages.

//CWP-48931
==== Parallel Registry Scanning

Prisma Cloud now supports scanning up to 4 registries in parallel as compared to scanning one registry at a time earlier under https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/31/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/vulnerability_management/registry_scanning/configure_registry_scanning[Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registries].
You can trigger a registry scan at the time of configuring the registry. The new registry scans wait in a queue until the previous scan completes.

You can either scan all registries or select multiple registries to scan in parallel, thus reducing the scan time.
By default, the Console is set to scan only 1 registry at a time. You can edit this registry scan limit to scan up to 4 registries in parallel by setting the `REGISTRY_SCANNERS = 4` in `twistlock.cfg` file.

//CWP-35771 //PCSUP-7591
* Fixed an issue where node count was missing for EKS clusters under *Manage > Cloud accounts* cloud *Discovery* report. The correct node count is now displayed on the Console and in https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cwpp/get-cloud-discovery[API Cloud Discovery scan results].

//CWP-50923
* Fixed an issue where AKS cluster names were not properly processed and the cluster was incorrectly classified as a generic Kubernetes cluster instead of an AKS cluster.
Now, the cluster names and their type are  properly parsed as AKS clusters.
