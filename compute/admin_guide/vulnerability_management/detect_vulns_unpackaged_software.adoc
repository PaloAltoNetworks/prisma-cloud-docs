== Vulnerabilities Detection

=== Supported packages and languages

Scan reports have a Package info tab, which lists all the packages installed in an image or host.
The following list shows the package types that are currently supported and can be seen in scan results, by the name they are shown in the scan.

* *Package* - supported Operating Systems packages, such as an RPM (Red Hat and derived distributions), dpkg/deb (Debian and derived distributions), or apk (Alpine Linux).
* *Jar* - the Java Archive format, which is a zip file with a standard structure. The war file format, or web app archive, is also supported.
* *Python* - a Python library.
* *Nodejs* - a Node.js library.
* *Gem* - a Ruby gem library.
* *Go* - a GoLang library
* *App* - a binary associated with a well-known application, such as Nginx or PostgreSQL. A full list of supported applications is listed below.

Prisma Cloud uses a variety of approaches for package detection, these are purpose-built differently for images and hosts. For example, the host Defender only scans applications, as well as language-based packages, if the processes are running. The Windows Defender only scans packages that are installed with a package manager, missing Microsoft hotfixes, and .net framework applications.

=== Unpackaged software

Typically, the software is added to container images and hosts with a package manager, such as `apt`, `yum`, and `npm`.
Prisma Cloud has a diverse set of upstream vulnerability data sources covering many different package managers across operating systems, including coverage for `Go`, `Java`, `Node.js`, `Python`, and `Ruby` components.
Prisma Cloud typically uses the package manager's metadata to discover installed components and versions, comparing this data to the data in the Intelligence Stream's real-time CVE feed.

Sometimes, you might install software without a package manager.
For example, the software might be built from a source and then added to an image with the Dockerfile `ADD` instruction, or your developers might unzip software from a tarball to a location on a host, and utilize the application.
In these cases, there is no package manager data associated with the application.

Prisma Cloud uses a variety of analysis techniques to detect metadata about software not installed by package managers. These are purpose-built differently for images and hosts.

This analysis augments existing vulnerability detection and blocking mechanisms, giving you a single view of all vulnerabilities, regardless of how the software is installed (distro's package manager, language runtime package manager, or without a package manager).
