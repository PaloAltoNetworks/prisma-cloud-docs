=== Scan images on Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)

To scan a repository, Prisma Cloud has to authenticate with ECR using either an IAM user (service account) or IAM role.
The minimum permissions policy required is *AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly*.
It is a managed, predefined policy.
AWS managed policies grant the minimum set of permissions required for common use cases so you don't need to spend a lot of time investigating permissions yourself.

The *AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly* permissions policy is currently defined as follows:
