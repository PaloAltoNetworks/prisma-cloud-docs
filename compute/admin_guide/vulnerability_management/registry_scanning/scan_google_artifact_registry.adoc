== Scan images in Google Artifact Registry

Although Artifact Registry supports a number of content types (for example, Java, Node.js, and Python language packages), Prisma Cloud only supports discovering and scanning Docker images.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud doesn't support scanning Helm charts saved as OCI images and stored in Artifact Registry.
Helm charts saved as OCI images have a single layer that contains the Helm package.
It is only a way to store a Helm chart, but it has no meaning in terms of a container.
Therefore, Prisma Cloud can't scan it.

=== Create a new registry scan

*Prerequisites:*

* xref:../../install/deploy-defender/defender_types.adoc[Deploy a Defender] somewhere in your environment.

* Create GCP credentials (service account) with, at minimum, the https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles[Artifact Registry Reader role(`roles/artifactregistry.reader`)].

* Add the service account credentials to the Prisma Cloud Compute Console credentials store under *Manage > Cloud accounts*.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, then go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registry settings*.

. Select *Add registry*.

. In *Version*, select *Google Artifact Registry*. 

. In *Registry*, enter the registry address.
+
The format for the address is <GCP-region>-docker.pkg.dev.
+
For example, europe-north1-docker.pkg.dev
+
Multi-region registry addresses are also supported, <GCP-multi-region>-docker.pkg.dev.
For example, us-docker.pkg.dev, europe-docker.pkg.dev, and asia-docker.pkg.dev.

. In *Credential*, select the service account you created in *Manage > Cloud accounts*.
+
If the credentials haven't been created already, click *+* to create them now.
If creating credentials:

.. In *Cloud accounts onboarding*, select *GCP* for the cloud provider.

.. Enter a credential name.

.. Select the credential level.

.. Paste the JSON token blob from your service account into the *Service Account* field.
Leave the *API Token* field blank.

.. Select *Next*.

.. Disable agentless scanning, then select *Next*.

.. Disable cloud discovery, then select *Add account*.

. (Optional) Refine which images Prisma Cloud should scan with the *Repositories*, *Repositories to exclude*, *Tags*, and *Tags to exclude* fields.
+
xref:../../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc[Pattern matching] is supported.

. In *OS type*, specify whether the repo holds *Linux* or *Windows* images.

. In *Scanners scope*, select the Defenders to use for the scan.
+
Console selects the available Defenders from this scope to execute the scan job.
For more information, see xref:../../vulnerability_management/registry_scanning/configure_registry_scanning.adoc#_deployment_patterns[deployment patterns].

. In *Number of scanners*, enter the number of Defenders across which scan jobs can be distributed.

. Set *Cap* to the number of most recent images to scan.
+
Leaving *Cap* set to *5* will scan the 5 most recent images.
Setting this field to *0* will scan all images.

. Select *Add and scan*.
+
Verify that the images in the repository are being scanned under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registries*.
