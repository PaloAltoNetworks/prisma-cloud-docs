=== Scan images in the OpenShift integrated Docker registry

To scan an OpenShift integrated registry, create a new registry scan setting.

*Prerequisites:*

* xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc#[Installed a Defender] within in your OpenShift cluster.
* Service account to authenticate to the internal registry.
** We recommend you use the existing `twistlock-service` account.
** The Defender authenticates to the OpenShift registry using this service account. 
** Added the cluster role permission of registry-viewer to the twistlock-service account.
+
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user registry-viewer system:serviceaccount:<twistlock_project>:twistlock-service
----
** Obtain the password for the twistlock-service account.
*** Determine the secret used by the service account `oc describe sa twistlock-service -n <twistlock_project>`
*** Use the *Image pull secrets* value (e.g. twistlock-service-dockercfg-64jtt) in the following command, for example:
+
----
oc get secret twistlock-service-dockercfg-64jtt -n twistlock --output=json|grep openshift.io/token-secret.value
----
*** Copy the openshift.io/token-secret.value for use later in the workflow.
*** If you use the OpenShift UI to obtain the token, click view-all to see the full token. 

[.procedure]
. Open Console, then go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Registry*.

. Click *Add registry*.

. In *Version*, select *Red Hat OpenShift*.

. Enter the registry address in the *Registry* field.

. In *Repository* , specify the repository to scan.
+
If you leave this field blank or enter a wildcard, Prisma Cloud finds and scans all repositories in the registry.
+
If you specify a partial string that ends with a wildcard, Prisma Cloud finds and scans all repositories that start with the partial string.
+
If you specify an exact match, Prisma Cloud scans just the specified repository.

. Click in the *Credential* field, then click *Add new*.
+
// Specifying credentials for OpenShift's integrated registry: https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/17150

.. Select the *Basic authentication* credential type

.. In *Username*, enter any arbitrary value.

.. In *Password*, enter the service account token you copied when you completed the prerequisite.

.. Save your credentials.

. In *OS type*, specify whether the repo holds *Linux* or *Windows* images.

. In *Scanners scope*, specify the collections of defenders to use for the scan.
+
Console selects the available Defenders from the scope to execute the scan job according to the *Number of scanners* setting.
For more information, see xref:../../vulnerability_management/registry_scanning.adoc#_deployment_patterns[deployment patterns].

. In *Number of scanners*, enter the number of Defenders across which scan jobs can be distributed.

. Set *Cap* to the number of most recent images to scan.
Leaving *Cap* set to *5* will scan the 5 most recent images.
Setting this field to *0* will scan all images.

. Click *Add*.

. Click the *Save* button.

=== Results

Verify that the images in the repository are being scanned.

[.procedure]

A progress indicator at the top right of the window shows the status of the current scan.
As the scan of each image is completed, its findings are added to the results table.

. To get details about the vulnerabilities in an image, click on it.
+
To force a specific repository to be scanned again, select *Scan* from the top right of the results table, then click on the specific registry to rescan.
