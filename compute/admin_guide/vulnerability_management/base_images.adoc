== Base images

Prisma Cloud lets you filter out base image vulnerabilities from your scan reports.

A base image is a starting point or an initial step for the image. Dockerfile usually starts from a base image.
Filtering out vulnerabilities which their source is the base image can help your teams focus on the vulnerabilities relevant for them to fix.

NOTE: Excluding base image vulnerabilities is currently not supported for Windows images.

=== Define base images

For Prisma Cloud to be able to exclude base image vulnerabilities, first identify the base images in your environment.

To define your base images, go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Base images*.
The base images you define must reside in your registry and they must be scanned in order to exclude their vulnerabilities from scan reports.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Base images*.

. Click *Add New*.

. Specify the base image and provide a description for it.
+
The base image should be specified in the following format: _registry/repo:tag_.
You can use wildcards for the tag's definition.

. Click *Save*.

. You can view the specific base image digests of the base image you created using the *View images* action.
+
These are the digests found in the registry scanning that are matching the base image you defined.
+
NOTE: Prisma Cloud stores a maximum of the 50 latest digests per base image. When the limit is reached, the oldest digests are overwritten as new digests are discovered.

=== Exclude base images vulnerabilities

When reviewing the health of the images in your environment, whether they are deployed images, registry images, or images scanned in a CI process, you can exclude the base image's vulnerabilities from the scan results.

[.procedure]
. Open the Console, then go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Deployed images / Registries / CI*. 

. Use the *Exclude base images vulns* filter to exclude the vulnerabilities coming from base images. You will see the vulnerabilities counters changing.

. Click on an image report to open a detailed report.

. Review the filtered vulnerabilities. For reviewing the base image, use the link in the top of the page.

. In the *Layers* tab, the vulnerabilities counters will also exclude base image vulnerabilities, and you'll see an indication for the base image's layers.
