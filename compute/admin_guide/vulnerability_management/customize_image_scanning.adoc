== Customize image scanning

You can customize how Prisma Cloud scans images and reports data.


[.task]
=== Configuring the severity of reported CVEs

By default, Prisma Cloud reports all vulnerabilities.
Setting the minimum reported severity lets you clean up the reported vulnerabilities to an actionable set.

To configure a minimum severity, install a new vulnerability rule, which overrides the default rule.
Note that Prisma Cloud maps the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to a
xref:../vulnerability_management/cvss_scoring.adoc#[grading system that ranges from Low to Critical.]

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Policy*.

. Click *Add rule*.

. Give your rule a name.

. In the table of *Severity based actions*, set the *Severity* in each row to an appropriate level.
For example, if you want to concentrate on just the most severe issues, set every row to *Critical*.

. Click *Save*.

. View the scan reports for all the entities in your system.
+
Go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities*.
All reported vulnerabilities match or exceed the severity setting in your custom rule.


=== Scanning custom components

Prisma Cloud lets you scan for insecure versions of proprietary software components.

First, augment Prisma Cloud's Intelligence Stream with your own custom data that specifies a package type, name, and version number.
Then configure Prisma Cloud to take action (alert, block) when the scanner finds this package in an image.
By default, Prisma Cloud raises an alert when it detects a vulnerability in a custom component.

Prisma Cloud supports the following package types:

* Distro packages (deb, rpm).
* Binaries.
* Nodejs packages.
* Python packages.
* Ruby gems.
* Java artifacts (JAR files).

For cases where Prisma Cloud does not offer built-in support for a package type, you can specify an MD5 hash for the file.


[.task]
=== Defining a custom vulnerability

Define a custom vulnerability.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Manage > System > Custom Feeds*.

. Click on *Custom Vulnerabilities*.

. Click *Add*.

.. Enter a name for your vulnerability..

.. From the drop-down list, select a package type.
+
For Debian packages, RPM packages, and shared libraries, select *package*.
+
If your package type is not supported, select *binary*.

.. Enter the name of your package/binary.
+
Package names can be specified using wild cards (*).

.. Specify the range of package versions for which your rule applies.
+
The following formats can be used to specify versions:
+
[cols="25%,50%,25%", options="header"]
|===
|Rule
|Format
|Example

|Specific version
|Enter a single multi-dot number.
|1.1

|Range of versions: Min and max are known.
|Enter two multi-dot numbers, separated by a dash.
|5.4-5.5

|Range of versions: Only min version is known.
|Specify a multi-dot number for the minimum version, followed by a dash, then a wild card.
|0.22.4.1-*

|Range of versions: Only max version is known.
|Specify a wild card (*) for the minimum version, followed by a dash, then a multi-dot number for the maximum version.
|*-0.22.4.1
|===
+
If package type is set to binary, the version fields are not visible.
Instead, enter the MD5 hash for your file or binary.

. Click *Save*.
+
Your custom vulnerability is now available to the scanner.
+
By default, an alert is logged if an image scan detects a component that you have designated as vulnerable.
To see the default rule, go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images*, and click on the *Default - alert all components* rule.  To change the default rule, select a different Alert or block threshold.
To take a different action, create a new vulnerability rule.
