== Malware scanning

Besides detecting software vulnerabilities (CVEs) and compliance issues (such as images configured to run as root), Prisma Cloud also detects malware in your container images.
No special configuration is required to enable this feature.

Malware analysis uses the data from Intelligence Stream, the xref:../configure/wildfire.adoc [Wildfire service], and custom feeds. Uploads to WildFire for malware analysis does not apply to Defenders, it is only for container CI and runtime protection for containers and hosts.  When using Defenders to scan images in a registry or images that are deployed, the MD5 signature is used.

See xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#malware-signatures[Import custom malware data], for information on how to upload custom malware data to Console and use it for image scanning.

NOTE: Malware scanning and detection is supported for Linux container images only.
Windows containers are not supported.

=== Detecting malware

The image scanner looks for malware in binaries in the image layers, including the base layer. When Prisma Cloud detects malware in an image, it logs the vulnerability in the image scan report.

To review the results of an image scan:

[.procedure]
. Open Console, then go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images*.

. Click on an image to get a detailed report from the last image scan.

. In the detailed report, click on the *Compliance* tab.

Issues with vulnerability ID 422 means that your image contains a file with an md5 signature of known malware.
