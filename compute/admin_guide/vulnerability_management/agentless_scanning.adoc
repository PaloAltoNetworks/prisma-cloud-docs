== Agentless scanning

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a virtual machine without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the instance.
Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders.
Currently, Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on AWS hosts for vulnerabilities.
Agentless capabilities will continue to be enhanced over future releases in parallel with Defender capabilities.

=== Prerequisites

* Before configuring agentless scanning for your cloud accounts, ensure you have added an access key with the required permissions to Prisma Cloud.
+
. Navigate to *System > Authentication > Credential store*.
+
. Click on *Actions* button in the right corner where you can download the list of required agentless permissions.
+
You can also manually download the file from https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/downloads/Agentless_Permissions.pdf[here].

* Ensure you have connectivity to Prisma Cloud Console over HTTPS from your cloud account.
+
By default, Prisma Cloud uses the default security group with default VPC for connection back to Console.
Optionally, you can specify a custom security group to use for connection to Console by providing security group name in the configuration settings. Prisma Cloud will automatically lookup VPC assigned, from the provided security group.

=== Prerequisites

* https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/add-aws-cloud-account-to-prisma-cloud.html[Onboard your AWS account], and ensure you select the *Monitor and Protect* mode on Prisma Cloud. 
+
The specific permissions to perform Agentless scanning in your AWS cloud accounts are documented in the CFT for the *Read-Write (Limited)* role.

* For currently onboarded accounts, if onboarded using the *Monitor* mode, switch to *Monitor and Protect* or selectively update the permissions for agentless scanning from the permissions documented in the template for the *Read-Write (Limited)* role. 

* If the existing account was onboarded for *Monitor and Protect*, update the CFT for the new permissions.

* Ensure you have connectivity to the Prisma Cloud administrative console from your cloud account.
+
Prisma Cloud uses the default VPC and security group.
If needed, you can specify a custom security group in the configuration settings.
// For agentless scanning, Prisma Cloud creates temporary EC2 spot instances and infrastructure within this VPC for the scan and uses the security group to communicate with the Prisma Cloud console.

=== Architecture

There are two ways you can set up agentless scanning with Prisma Cloud.

* Scan all hosts of a cloud account within the same cloud account (called 'target' account which is independent), or
* Scan all hosts of a cloud account (target account which is dependent on another account) in another dedicated cloud account (called 'scan hub account'). 

*Option 1: Scan within the same account*

. Onboard cloud accounts inside Prisma Cloud Compute with specific permissions required for agentless setup.
These permissions can be downloaded from UI during agentless scan setup. 
. Prisma Cloud enumerates instances in each account and creates snapshots for each instance.
. Prisma Cloud starts spot instances within the customerâ€™s accounts, attaches snapshots, injects twistcli, performs analysis.
These instances will be referred to as "scanners".
. Scanners send results to Console and then get deleted.
. Process repeats for periodic scans.

NOTE: In the downloaded tarball, the cloud formation template that applies to this setup has the suffix *_target_user_permissions.json*.

*Option 2: Scan within a dedicated cloud account*

. Onboard accounts with different permissions for dedicated scan hub account which will perform all scans vs other target accounts that have hosts to be scanned.
. Prisma Cloud only spins up scanners in the dedicated scan hub cloud account and attaches snapshots of instances from other accounts to the scanners in this account. 
. Scanners send results to Console and then get deleted.
. Process repeats for periodic scans.

NOTE: In the downloaded tarball, the cloud formation template that applies to the target account (account that needs to be scanned) has the suffix *_hub_target_user_permissions.json* and the cloud formation template that applies to the scan hub account (account that is dedicated for scanning all other accounts) has the suffix *_hub_user_permissions.json*.

=== Configure a scan

You can use agentless scanning in multiple platforms.
Each platform requires you to complete a xref:../configure/configure-agentless-scanning.adoc[platform-specific configuration].

=== Results

Navigate to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Hosts* to view agentless scan results.
You can see a column named *Agentless* in the results page.
On the rows where agentless is *Enabled*, scan results are provided by agentless scanning. 

Agentless scans provide risk factors associated with each vulnerability such as package in use, exposed to internet, etc. (learn more https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/vuln_explorer[here]).
You can add tags and create policies in alert mode for exceptions.
Agentless scanning is integrated with Vulnerability Explorer and Host Radar.

*Scan Settings:*
Periodic scans occur every 24 hours by default.
You can change the scan interval under *Manage - System > Scan - Agentless* setting.
You can also perform on-demand scans by clicking the *Agentless scan* button on the *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Hosts* page.
