== Agentless scanning

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a virtual machine without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the instance.
Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders.
Currently, Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on AWS, GCP and Azure hosts for vulnerabilities and compliance.
Agentless capabilities will continue to be enhanced over future releases in parallel with Defender capabilities.

See xref:../configure/agentless-scanning-modes.adoc[scanning modes] to review the scanning options and xref:../configure/configure-agentless-scanning.adoc[to configure agentless scanning].

=== Vulnerability Scan

Agentless scan results are cohesively integrated with Defender results throughout the Console to provide seamless experience.

Vulnerability scan  rules  control the data surfaced in Prisma Cloud Console, including scan reports and Radar visualizations. To modify these rules, see xref:./vulnerability_management_rules.adoc[vulnerability scan rules].  


==== View Scan Results

Navigate to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Hosts* to view agentless vulnerability scan results.
You can see a column named *Scanned by* in the results page.
On the rows where entry is *Agentless*, scan results are provided by agentless scanning. 

Agentless scans provide risk factors associated with each vulnerability such as package in use, exposed to internet, etc. (https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/compliance/compliance_explorer[here]).
You can add tags and create policies in alert mode for exceptions.
Agentless scanning is integrated with Vulnerability Explorer and Host Radar.

Agentless scans also provide: 

* Host Compliance and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/compliance/custom_compliance_checks[custom compliance] scans
* Unscanned region detection with Cloud Discovery integration
* Pending OS security updates 


==== Compliance scans

Navigate to *Monitor > Compliance > Hosts* to view agentless compliance scan results.
You can see a column named *Scanned by* in the results page.
On the rows where entry is *Agentless*, scan results are provided by agentless scanning.

Agentless scans provide risk factors associated with each compliance issue and overall compliance rate for host benchmarks. (learn more https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/vuln_explorer[here]).
You can add tags and create policies in alert mode for exceptions.
Agentless scanning is integrated with Compliance Explorer and Host Radar. 

==== Custom Compliance scans

You can create custom compliance checks on file systems for your host and add them to your compliance policy for scanning. 
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/compliance/custom_compliance_checks[Follow the instructions] to enable custom compliance checks in a single step for both Defenders and Agentless scans. 

==== Pending OS updates

Unpatched OSes lead to security risks and greater possibility of exploits. 
Through agentless scanning, find pending OS security updates as a compliance check.

You can search for all hosts with pending OS updates by searching for "Ensure no pending OS updates" string in Compliance explorer page (Monitor > Compliance > Compliance eExplorer tab).

*Syntax:*
 <package name> [<current version>] (<new version available> â€¦)

==== Cloud Discovery

When cloud discovery is enabled, agentless scans are automatically integrated with the results to provide visibility into all regions and cloud accounts where agentless scanning is not enabled along with undefended hosts.
