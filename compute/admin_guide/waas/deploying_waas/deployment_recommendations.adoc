== Recommended WAAS Deployment Phases

It is recommended that WAAS is first deployed in non-production environments, and then promoted and implemented in production environments gradually.
Below are the guidelines for each of the recommended phases and their prerequisites.

*Prerequisites:*

* A way to test the application before deploying WAAS and verify that it's working properly, e.g. a working cURL command with the expected outcome.
* A certificate (public certificate and private key files in PEM format) is required if the application employs TLS.
* If you are planning to protect API endpoints, please provide API specification files if available (Swagger or OpenAPI 3)

[.procedure]
. Deploy WAAS in a test environment (preferably one that is as similar to production as possible). 
+
All protections will be set to "Alert".

. Allow WAAS to inspect traffic to the test environment for a few days, then regroup to examine triggers and findings. It is recommended to generate traffic to the test environment preferably requests that simulate real user messages. 
+
The goal here is to fine-tune protections so that they correspond with the design of the protected application.
+
This would also be a good way to assess the performance impact introduced by WAAS and compare it to the performance of the application prior to the deployment of WAAS .

. Following the successful completion of phases 1 and 2, we deploy WAAS on a small portion of production with the same configuration that we tested in the test environment. 
+
We then examine the findings after a few days and make any necessary adjustments to the policies.

. Deploying WAAS across the entire production deployment of the application.
