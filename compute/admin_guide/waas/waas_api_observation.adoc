== API Discovery

WAAS can automatically learn the API endpoints in your app, show an endpoint usage report, and let you export all discovered endpoints as an OpenAPI 3.0 spec file.

=== Enable API discovery

When API discovery is enabled, Defender inspects API traffic routed to the protected app.
Defenders learn the endpoints in your API by analyzing incoming requests and generating a tree of API paths.
Every 30 minutes, Defender sends Console a diff of what it has learned since its last update.
Console merges the update with what it already knows about the API.

The API discovery subsystem attempts to ignore all HTTP traffic that doesn't resemble an API call.
Defender uses some criteria for identifying which requests to inspect:

* Requests must have non-error response codes.
* Requests must not have an extension (.css, .html, etc).
* Requests content type must be textual (`text/`), application (`application/`), or empty.

API discovery is enabled by default.
Learning is either on or off.
(Compare this to container runtime protection, where there's a learning period, and after the learning period has elapsed, the model of "known good activity" is locked.) 

To enable API discovery for a protected app:

[.procedure]
. Log in to the Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > {Container (Inline/Out-Of-Band) | Host (Inline/Out-Of-Band) | Agentless}*.

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter the required details.

. Enable *API endpoint discovery*.

. *Save* the rule.
+
NOTE: If you have not enabled *API endpoint discovery* while creating a rule, you can also enable it after the rule creation.

=== Inspect discovered endpoints

The endpoint report under *Monitor* > *WAAS* > *API discovery* > enumerates discovered APIs per path, HTTP method, app, and on image basis. It shows information such as Path, HTTP method, Hits, API protection status, *Path risk factors*, *Workload* that's running these resources, Image Risk factors, Resource Vulnerabilities, and last seen date.
Select a path to get more statistics on an endpoint and view the JSON structure.

Select an endpoint to view the sidecar with additional statistics, such as request and response size ranges, and the sum of each specific returned status code.
The statistics also show the `json` payload that was sent with the API request.

You can export the discovered endpoints for an app as an OpenAPI spec file.
Alternatively, you can select the 3 dots `...` and Delete, to delete everything that WAAS has learned about the API for an app so far.

NOTE: If a rule with an app is deleted from the WAAS policy, its learned endpoints are also deleted.

*Path risk profiling*

The *Path risk factors* indicate the three critical path risks identified in the endpoints:
* Endpoints accessible from the internet (icon).
* Endpoints that do not require authentication (icon) to be accessed.
* Endpoints with sensitive data (icon) such as Credit card, PII, ID query parameter, and Session cookies, .etc. The xref:log-scrubbing.adoc[sensitive data] is defined under *Defend > WAAS > Sensitive data*.

For example, the risk factors in the screenshot under the section `Inspect discovered endpoints`, detect the resource path`/login` with vulnerable API endpoints that are exposed to the internet, APIs with sensitive data, and APIs that allow unauthenticated access to them.

*Protecting endpoints*

To protect a path, select *Protect* next to a resource, set effects for all API endpoints discovered in the App, and select *Protect all*.
This enables you to protect all the API endpoints in the resource path identified within an app to the WAAS policy rule, and not just the selected path.

*Export API specifications*

Select *Export OpenAPI* next to the resource path to export all the API endpoints, HTTP method, and the Server name discovered by the app for the given WAAS policy rule as OpenAPI 3.0 JSON.
