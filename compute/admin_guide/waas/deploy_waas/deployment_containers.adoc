=== Create a WAAS In-Line rule for Containers

[.procedure]

. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > Container > In-Line*.
. Click *Add Rule*.
. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.

+
NOTE: Collections define a combination of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_collection.png[scale=20]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid - instead, only specify your web application images.
. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*.
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.
. (Optional) Enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint to protect the ports identified in the unprotected web apps report *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
+
NOTE: As an additional measure, you can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app to also include the ports that may not have been detected automatically.
+
By enabling both *Automatically detect ports* and *API endpoint discovery*, you can monitor your API endpoints and ports without having to add an application and without configuring any policies. 

. *Save* the rule.

=== Add an App (policy) to the rule
