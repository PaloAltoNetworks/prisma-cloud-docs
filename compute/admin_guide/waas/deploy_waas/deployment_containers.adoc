== Deploy WAAS for Containers

[.task]
=== Create a WAAS rule for Containers

[.procedure]

. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS*.
. Select the *Container*.
. Click *Add Rule*.
. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+

+
NOTE: Collections define a combination of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_collection.png[width=550]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid - instead, only specify your web application images.
. (Optional) Enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint to protect the ports identified in the unprotected web apps report *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
+
NOTE: As an additional measure, you can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app to also include the ports that may not have been detected automatically.
. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*.
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API observations > Out of band observations.
+
NOTE: By enabling both *Automatically detect ports* and *API endpoint discovery*, you can monitor your API endpoints and ports without having to add an application and without configuring any policies. 

. *Save* the rule.

[.task]
=== Add an App (policy) to the rule

[.procedure]
. Select a WAAS container rule to add an App in.

.. Click *Add app*.
.. In *App Definition*, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
+
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load. Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]
+
If you do not have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.
.. In the *Endpoint setup* tab, click *Add Endpoint*.
+
image::cnaf_add_endpoint.png[width=550]
+
image::waas_endpoint_lineitem.png[width=550]
+
* Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the the value of the external port is "80" for non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.site", "docs.example.site", "www.example.site:8080", etc. 
+
* Enter *App ports* (optional, if you selected *Automatically detect ports* while creating the rule). 
+
When *Automatically detect ports* is selected, any ports specified in a protected endpoint definition will be appended to the list of protected ports.
+
* Specify the TCP port listening for inbound HTTP traffic.
+
NOTE: If your application uses *TLS* or *gRPC*, you must specify a port number.
+
* Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on, when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api", etc.
+
* If your application uses TLS, set *TLS* to *On*.
+
* If your application uses HTTP/2, set *HTTP/2* to *On*.
+
WAAS must be able to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic to function properly.
+
* If your application uses gRPC, set *gRPC* to *On*.

.. Click *Response headers* to add or override HTTP response headers in responses sent from the protected application.
+
image::waas_response_headers.png[width=550] 

.. Click *Create Endpoint*.

.. To facilitate inspection, after creating all endpoints, click *View TLS settings* in the endpoint setup menu.
+ 
image::waas_tls_settings.png[width=550,align="left"]
+
TLS settings:
+
image::waas_tls_settings_detailed.png[width=550,align="left"]
+
* *Certificate* - Copy and paste your server's certificate and private key into the certificate input box (e.g., `cat server-cert.pem server-key > certs.pem`).
+
* *Minimum TLS version* - A minimum version of TLS can be enforced by WAAS to prevent downgrading attacks (the default value is TLS 1.2).
+
* *HSTS* - The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)] response header lets web servers tell browsers to use HTTPS only, not HTTP.
When enabled, WAAS would add the HSTS response header to all HTTPS server responses (if it is not already present) with the preconfigured directives - `max-age`, `includeSubDomains`, and `preload`.
+
... `max-age=<expire-time>` - Time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
+
... `includeSubDomains` (optional) - If selected, HSTS protection applies to all the site's subdomains as well.
+
... `preload` (optional) - For more details, see the following https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security#preloading_strict_transport_security[link].

.. If your application requires [API protection], select the *API Protection* tab and define for each path the allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions on the [API protection] help page.

. Continue to *App Firewall* tab, select xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc[protections] to enable and assign them with <<../waas-intro.adoc#actions>>.
+
image::waas_firewall_protections_with_banner.png[width=750]

. Continue to *Access Control* tab and select <<../waas_access_control.adoc#,access controls>> to enable.

. Continue to *DoS protection* tab and configure <<../waas_dos_protection.adoc#,DoS protection>> thresholds.

. Continue to *Bot protection* tab and select <<../waas_bot_protection.adoc#,bot protections>> to enable.

. Click *Save*.

. You should be redirected to the *Rule Overview* page.
+
Select the created new rule to display *Rule Resources* and for each application a list of *protected endpoints* and *enabled protections*.
+
image::waas_rule_overview.png[width=650]

. Test protected endpoint using the following xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc#sanity_tests[sanity tests].

. Go to *Monitor > Events*, click on *WAAS for containers* and observe events generated. 
+
