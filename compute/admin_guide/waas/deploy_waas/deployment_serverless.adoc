== Deploying WAAS for serverless functions

[.task]
=== Create a WAAS rule for serverless

When Serverless Defender is embedded in a function, it offers built-in web application firewall (WAF) capabilities, including protection against:

* SQL injection (SQLi) attacks
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
* Command injection (CMDi) attacks
* Local file system inclusion (LFI) attacks
* Code injection attacks

NOTE: Some xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc[protections] are not available for WAAS serverless deployment.

*Prerequisites:* You already xref:../../install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender.adoc[embedded Serverless Defender] into your function.

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter a rule name.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.

Collections define a combination of functions to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:

Use xref:../../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc[pattern matching] to precisely target your rule.

. Select *Alert* or *Prevent*.

. If necessary, adjust the *Proxy timeout*
+
NOTE: The maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire request, including the body. A 500 error response is returned if a request is not read within the timeout period. For applications dealing with large files, adjusting the proxy timeout is necessary.
