== Deploy WAAS Out-Of-Band with VPC Traffic Mirroring

Out-Of-Band WAAS rules inspect HTTP requests and responses via a mirror of the traffic to provide WAAS detections. 
VPC traffic mirroring feature can mirror the traffic for Out-Of-Band inspection to Prisma Cloud Compute Defenders.
In Out-Of-Band mode, WAAS does not proxy traffic to or from the protected application and all the detections are applied on a read-only copy of the traffic. 
As a result, there is no risk of interfering with the application flow.

WAAS can observe a mirror of HTTP traffic flowing to and from CSP (AWS) instances even if they are not protected by a Prisma Cloud Compute Defender.

To enable Out-Of-Band protection using VPC traffic mirroring, deploy one or more Prisma Cloud Compute agents on the target instance on which the traffic will be mirrored.x
The agents deployed for Out-Of-Band traffic mirror are termed Observers.
The target instance is configured on a separate instance within the same VPC to receive Out-Of-Band traffic from the unprotected applications on the source instance. These Observers on the target instance inspect Out-Of-Band traffic and send audits of any events they identify to the console.

=== Prerequisites

* Deployed Observers should have connectivity to Prisma Cloud Compute console.

* Console and the Observers must be running 22.06 version or later.

* Monitoring applications Out-Of-Band via VPC traffic mirroring is subject to limitations, quotas, and checksum offloading as defined in the  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-limits.html[AWS documentation].

* To configure WAAS Out-Of-Band with AWS VPC traffic mirroring, apply the permission template ending in https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/waas/aws/agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json[agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json] to AWS CloudFormation console for your account. For detailed instructions on how to apply cloud formation templates, refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html[AWS documentation].
+
Edit the template and replace the "USER-agentless-app-firewall" value with the actual username.

* Create an AWS Cloud account under *Compute > Manage > Cloud accounts* using the `Access key` from your AWS account.

=== Create a WAAS rule for Out-Of-Band VPC Traffic Mirroring

To deploy WAAS for Out-Of-Band with VPC traffic mirroring, create a new rule, configure VPC, define application endpoints, and select protections.

[.procedure]
. Create a WAAS rule under *Defend > WAAS > Agentless > Add rule*.
. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
. Add *VPC Configuration* to allow the mirrored traffic to flow from the source instance to the Prisma Cloud Observer deployed on the target instance.
.. Select *Console address* as the hostname of the Console to connect to.
.. Select the AWS *Cloud account*.
.. Select the AWS *Region* where the mirrored VMs are located in.
.. Enter the *VPC ID* to look for instances to mirror and to deploy the Observer in. 
.. Enter the *VPC Subnet ID* to look for instances to be mirrored only in the selected Subnet ID, and to deploy the Observer in.
.. Specify the *Tags* or wildcards identifying the EC2 instances to mirror in Key:Value format or "*".
.. Enter *Instance names* or wildcards to identify the EC2 instances to mirror.
.. Enter the *Ports* to mirror.
.. Select the *Instance type* to use for the Observer instance.
.. Click *Add*.

+
Deployment will be done using a dynamically constructed AWS CloudFormation template, programmatically with CloudFormation API.
. (Optional) Toggle to enable *API endpoint discovery*.
+
When enabled, the Observer inspects the mirrored traffic to and from the remote applications.
The Observer reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.
. *Save* the rule.

[.task]
=== Add an App (policy) to the rule

[.procedure]
. Select a WAAS rule to add an App in.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the *App Definition* tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

=== VPC Configuration Status

Once a VPC configuration is saved, a cloud formation template will be created and deployed in the selected region. You can track the stack deployment through Prisma Console. 

* *Deploying*: The WAAS rule is getting ready as the Observer is being deployed in the AWS instance and the session is being established between the Observer and the resources.

* *Ready*: The WAAS rule is ready to be protecting the selected resources. The Observer will check for new instances (based on the selected tags or instance names) once every hour.

* *Error*: The rule is in error and the deployment failed. Fix the error, and click *Update* to reapply the configuration.

* *Deleting process*: The Observer deployment is being torn down, and the session is being terminated.

* *Deleting process error*: Error in tearing down the Observer setup on AWS VPC.

image::waas-agentless-rules.png[width=350]
+
Use *Refresh* to see the updated status of the rules on the UI.
+
NOTE: Only when the configuration is in *Error* status, an *Update* is allowed to reapply the configuration.

=== Updating VPC Configurations

You can update the VPC configurations for ports, tags, Console name, and EC2 instance names, this will update the AWS CloudFormation template and AWS will create/destroy only the updated AWS resources.

image::edit-vpc-configuration.png[width=350]

Edit the fields and *Save* to reapply the configurations.

[#actions]
=== WAAS Actions for Out-Of-Band traffic

The following actions are applicable for the HTTP requests or responses related to the *Out-Of-Band traffic*:

* *Alert* - An audit is generated for visibility.

* *Disable* - The WAAS action is disabled.

=== Limitations

*Limitations for setting traffic mirroring imposed by AWS*

* Not all AWS instance types support traffic mirroring, for example, T2 is not supported (relevant for both source and target EC2 instances)

* If more than 10 instances are mirrored to the same EC2 instance (which is running the defender), a network load balancer has to be used:

** Maximum number of sessions per account: 10000
** Maximum number of sources per Network Load Balancer: No limit
** Maximum number of sessions per target (smaller sizes): 10
** Maximum number of sources per target (largest size): 100 (for example, m5.24xlarge)

*TLS Limitations*

* TLS settings for Out-of-Band do not support TLS 1.3.

* Only the following RSA Key Exchange cipher suites are supported:

** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

* TLS connections using extended_master_secret(23) in the negotiation are not supported as part of this feature.

* Out-of-Band does not support HTTP/2 protocol.

* DHKE is not supported due to a lack of information required to generate the encryption key.

* The full handshake process must be captured. Partial transmission or session resumption process inspection won't be decrypted.

* Same VPC configuration cannot be used to inspect both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you must create two different Agentless rules one for each HTTP and HTTPS traffic monitoring. 
+
NOTE: Upgrading VPC observer should be done through *Manage > Defenders*.

=== Troubleshooting VPC traffic mirroring

* `Failed to set up VPC traffic mirroring: failed creating AWS stack, status ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`.
+
When the configuration status shows the following error, as shown in the screenshot below, check the AWS CloudFormation stack events for the error.
+
image::err1-failed-to-setup-vpc.png[width=350]
+
Some of the scenarios in the AWS CloudFormation that may lead to the above error:

** *Error*: `You are not authorized to perform this operation`
+
*Reason*: The selected AWS cloud account doesn't have enough permissions for deployment.
+
image::err2-not-authorized.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- Modify the account with the correct permissions as mentioned in the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/waas/aws/agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json[agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json] file, and select *Update* to retry the deployment.
- Delete the rule in error and create a new rule in AWS Cloud account with the permissions as mentioned in the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/waas/aws/agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json[agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json] file to AWS CloudFormation console for your account.

** *Error*: `SessionNumber 1 already in use for eni-*`
+
*Reason*: Trying to mirror an already mirrored EC2 instance (either by WAAS or another product).
+
image::err3-session-already-in-use.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- Edit the VPC configuration and remove the instance from the tags or instance names list, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.
- Remove the mirroring from the machine from the other rule/other product, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.

** *Error*: `WaitCondition received failed message: 'Defender deployment failed' for uniqueid: i-xxxx.`
+
*Reason*: Failed to deploy because the Console is not accessible from AWS.
+
image::err4-failedcondition-received.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- Check if https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/configure/configure-agentless-scanning#_configure_agentless_scanning__onboard_aws_accounts_for_agentless_scanning[AWS account can connect with the Prisma Cloud Console] with Console URL that you selected.
+
If the Console is unreachable, delete the rule and create a new rule with a valid Prisma Cloud Console URL.
+
If the Console is not reachable due to a firewall rule or other blocking rules, fix the rule to allow the connectivity to the Console, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.

** *Error*: `Failed to find VMs to mirror`
+
*Reason*: The security token included in the request is invalid.
+
image::err5-failed-to-find-vms.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- *Edit Configuration* to ensure that the AWS cloud account exists for the user, and also ensure that a correct secret key is used, *Save* the configuration.
- Click *Update* to reapply the configuration.
