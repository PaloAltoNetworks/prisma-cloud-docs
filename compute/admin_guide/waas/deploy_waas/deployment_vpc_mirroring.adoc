== Deploy WAAS Agentless with VPC Traffic Mirroring

Out-Of-Band WAAS rules inspect HTTP requests and responses via a mirror of the traffic to provide WAAS detections. 
VPC traffic mirroring feature can mirror the traffic for Out-Of-Band inspection to Prisma Cloud Compute Defenders.
In Out-Of-Band mode, WAAS does not proxy traffic to or from the protected application and all the detections are applied on a read-only copy of the traffic. 
As a result, there is no risk of interfering with the application flow.

WAAS can observe a mirror of HTTP traffic flowing to and from CSP (AWS) instances even if they are not protected by a Prisma Cloud Compute Defender.

NOTE: VPC Observer is an EC2 instance running a Host defender for VPC Traffic Mirroring. 
The target instance is configured on a separate instance within the same VPC to receive Out-Of-Band traffic from the unprotected applications on the source instance. These Observers on the target instance inspect Out-Of-Band traffic and send audits of any events they identify to the console.

To setup WAAS Agentless with VPC traffic mirroring, specify the EC2 instances to mirror (exact names or using wildcards or tags) in a VPC, the ports to mirror, and other AWS parameters in a VPC traffic mirroring rule.
For each VPC traffic mirroring rule, a VPC Observer will be created in a VPC machine to receive the mirrored traffic (the VPC observer is an EC2 instance running a host defender).

=== Prerequisites

* Deployed Observers should have connectivity to Prisma Cloud Compute console.

* Console and the Observers must be running 22.06 version or later.

* Monitoring applications Out-Of-Band via VPC traffic mirroring is subject to limitations, quotas, and checksum offloading as defined in the  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-limits.html[AWS documentation].

* To configure WAAS Out-Of-Band with AWS VPC traffic mirroring, apply the permission template ending in https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/waas/aws/agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json[agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json] to AWS CloudFormation console for your account. For detailed instructions on how to apply cloud formation templates, refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html[AWS documentation].
+
Edit the template and replace the "USER-agentless-app-firewall" value with the actual username.

* Create an AWS Cloud account under *Compute > Manage > Cloud accounts* using the `Access key` from your AWS account.
+
NOTE: Cloud accounts require *Cloud discovery* to be enabled to discover the EC2 instances to mirror.

=== Create a WAAS rule for Out-Of-Band VPC Traffic Mirroring

To deploy WAAS for Out-Of-Band with VPC traffic mirroring, create a new rule, configure VPC, define application endpoints, and select protections.

[.procedure]
. Create a WAAS rule under *Defend > WAAS > Agentless > Add rule*.
. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
. Add *VPC Configuration* to allow the mirrored traffic to flow from the source instance to the Prisma Cloud Observer deployed on the target instance.
.. Select *Console address* as the hostname of the Console to connect to.
.. Select the AWS *Cloud account*.
.. Select the AWS *Region* where the mirrored VMs are located in.
.. Enter the *VPC ID* to look for instances to mirror and to deploy the Observer in. 
.. Enter the *VPC Subnet ID* to look for instances to be mirrored only in the selected Subnet ID, and to deploy the Observer in.
.. Specify the *Tags* or wildcards identifying the EC2 instances to mirror in Key:Value format or "*".
.. Enter *Instance names* or wildcards to identify the EC2 instances to mirror.
+
The instance to mirror is mapped by machine tags:instance names.
.. Enter the *Ports* to mirror.
+
You can enter a maximum of 5 ports. Port ranges are not supported.
.. Select the *Instance type* to use for the VPC Observer instance.
.. Click *Add*.
+

+
Deployment will be done using a dynamically constructed AWS CloudFormation template, programmatically with CloudFormation API. The WAAS rule is not immediately applied, there will be stages of the rules as the VPC configuration is being deployed in AWS. You can track the status of the deployment in the AWS CloudFormation stack, and also on Prisma Cloud Console.

. (Optional) Toggle to enable *API endpoint discovery*.
+
When enabled, the Observer inspects the mirrored traffic to and from the remote applications.
The Observer reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.
. *Save* the rule.

[.task]
=== Add an App (policy) to the rule

[.procedure]
. Select a WAAS rule to add an App in.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the *App Definition* tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

. If you do not have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.

.. In the *Endpoint Setup* tab, click *Add Endpoint*.

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas-oob-endpoint.png[width=350]

.. Enter *Port*.
+
Specify the TCP port listening for inbound HTTP traffic.

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. 

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on, when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api", etc. 

.. Click *Create*

.. If your application requires xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection], select the "API Protection" tab and define for each path the allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions in the xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection] help page.

+
NOTE: For more information, see the <<../waas_analytics.adoc#,WAAS analytics help page>>

=== VPC Configuration Status

Once the VPC configuration is saved, a cloud formation template will be created and deployed in the selected region. You can track the stack deployment stages through Prisma Console. 

* *Deploying*: The WAAS rule is getting ready as the Observer is being deployed in the AWS instance and the session is being established between the Observer and the resources.

* *Ready*: The WAAS rule is ready to be protecting the selected resources. The Observer will check for new instances (based on the selected tags or instance names) once every hour.

* *Error*: The rule is in error and the deployment failed. Fix the error, and click *Update* to reapply the configuration.

* *Deleting process*: The Observer deployment is being torn down, and the session is being terminated.

* *Deleting process error*: Error in tearing down the Observer setup on AWS VPC.

image::waas-agentless-rules.png[width=350]
+
Use *Refresh* to see the updated status of the rules on the UI.
+
NOTE: Only when the VPC configuration is in *Error* status, an *Update* is allowed to reapply the configuration.

You can *Delete* an Agentless rule, that will tear down the entire VPC stack configuration and resources. Once the rule deletion is complete, the rule will disapper from the Console and the Observer will be uninstalled.

The VPC Observer is installed under *Manage > Defenders * Deployed Defenders*. A VPC observer can only be deleted if you delete the rule from the Console.

=== Updating VPC Configurations

You can update the VPC configurations only tags, instance names, ports, and instance type of the VPC Observer. This will update the AWS CloudFormation template and AWS will create/destroy only the updated AWS resources.

If you update the instance type of the VPC Observer, the AWS will recreate the EC2 instance and there will be a downtime.

image::edit-vpc-configuration.png[width=250]

Edit the fields and *Save* to reapply the configurations.

[#actions]
=== WAAS Actions for Out-Of-Band traffic

The following actions are applicable for the HTTP requests or responses related to the *Out-Of-Band traffic*:

* *Alert* - An audit is generated for visibility.

* *Disable* - The WAAS action is disabled.

=== Limitations

*Limitations for setting traffic mirroring imposed by AWS*

* Not all AWS instance types support traffic mirroring, for example, T2 is not supported (relevant for both source and target EC2 instances)

* If more than 10 instances are mirrored to the same EC2 instance (which is running the defender), a network load balancer has to be used:

** Maximum number of sessions per account: 10000
** Maximum number of sources per Network Load Balancer: No limit
** Maximum number of sessions per target (smaller sizes): 10
** Maximum number of sources per target (largest size): 100 (for example, m5.24xlarge)

* Some regions don't currently support the m5n.2xlarge and m5n.4xlarge instance types, so these types cannot be used for the VPC Observer (For example, Paris).

*TLS Limitations*

* TLS settings for Out-of-Band do not support TLS 1.3.

* Only the following RSA Key Exchange cipher suites are supported:

** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

* TLS connections using extended_master_secret(23) in the negotiation are not supported as part of this feature.

* Out-of-Band does not support HTTP/2 protocol.

* DHKE is not supported due to a lack of information required to generate the encryption key.

* The full handshake process must be captured. Partial transmission or session resumption process inspection won't be decrypted.

* Same VPC configuration cannot be used to inspect both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you must create two different Agentless rules one for each HTTP and HTTPS traffic monitoring. 
+
NOTE: Upgrading VPC observer should be done through *Manage > Defenders*.

*WAAS Agentless Limitations*

* An EC2 instance can only be attached to one agentless rule.
* An agentless rule can only inspect machines from one VPC and Subnet combination.
* Each agentless rule can only have a maximum of 5 ports in the VPC configuration.
* Changing the VPC observer instance types involves downtime.
* Observer status is not monitored 
* Once the AWS setup is created/updated in agentless rule, the observer status is not monitored on the agentless rule, but you can check the status from under *Manage > Defenders > Deployed defenders* page.

=== Troubleshooting VPC traffic mirroring

* `Failed to set up VPC traffic mirroring: failed creating AWS stack, status ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`.
+
When the configuration status shows the following error, as shown in the screenshot below, check the AWS CloudFormation stack events for the error.
+
image::err1-failed-to-setup-vpc.png[width=350]
+
Some of the scenarios in the AWS CloudFormation that may lead to the above error:

** *Error*: `You are not authorized to perform this operation`
+
*Reason*: The selected AWS cloud account doesn't have enough permissions for deployment.
+
image::err2-not-authorized.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- Modify the account with the correct permissions as mentioned in the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/waas/aws/agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json[agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json] file, and select *Update* to retry the deployment.
- Delete the rule in error and create a new rule in AWS Cloud account with the permissions as mentioned in the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/waas/aws/agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json[agentless_app_firewall_permissions_template.json] file to AWS CloudFormation console for your account.

** *Error*: `SessionNumber 1 already in use for eni-*`
+
*Reason*: Trying to mirror an already mirrored EC2 instance (either by WAAS or another product).
+
image::err3-session-already-in-use.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- Edit the VPC configuration and remove the instance from the tags or instance names list, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.
- Remove the mirroring from the machine from the other rule/other product, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.

** *Error*: `WaitCondition received failed message: 'Defender deployment failed' for uniqueid: i-xxxx.`
+
*Reason*: Failed to deploy because the Console is not accessible from AWS.
+
image::err4-failedcondition-received.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- Check if https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/configure/configure-agentless-scanning#_configure_agentless_scanning__onboard_aws_accounts_for_agentless_scanning[AWS account can connect with the Prisma Cloud Console] with Console URL that you selected.
+
If the Console is unreachable, delete the rule and create a new rule with a valid Prisma Cloud Console URL.
+
If the Console is not reachable due to a firewall rule or other blocking rules, fix the rule to allow the connectivity to the Console, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.

** *Error*: `Failed to find VMs to mirror`
+
*Reason*: The security token included in the request is invalid.
+
image::err5-failed-to-find-vms.png[width=350]
+
*Solution*:
- *Edit Configuration* to ensure that the AWS cloud account exists for the user, and also ensure that a correct secret key is used, *Save* the configuration.
- Click *Update* to reapply the configuration.
