== Deploy WAAS Out-Of-Band

Out-Of-Band WAAS rules inspect HTTP requests and responses through a mirror of the traffic to provide WAAS detections. 
VPC traffic mirroring can mirror the traffic for Out-Of-Band inspection to Prisma Cloud Compute Defenders without additional configurations.

In Out-Of-Band mode, WAAS does not proxy traffic to or from the protected application and all the detections are applied on a read-only copy of the traffic. 
As a result, there is no risk of interfering with the application flow.

You can use the TLS protocol (1.0, 1.1, 1.2) over HTTP/1.1 with the following RSA Key Exchange cipher suites to protect the API endpoints:

* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
* TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

The full handshake process must be captured as partial transmission or session resumption process inspection are not (or cannot be) decrypted.

=== Prerequisites

* You have xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc#[installed a Container Defender] in your workload environment.
* The minimum version of Console and Defender is 22.12. 
* A TLS certificate in PEM format.

=== Create a WAAS rule for Out-Of-Band network traffic

To deploy WAAS for Out-Of-Band network traffic, create a new rule, define application endpoints, and select protections.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > [Container|Host] > Out-Of-Band*.

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[scale=20]
+
Collections define a combination of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_collection.png[scale=20]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid - instead, only specify your web application images.

. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.

. (Optional) Enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint to deploy the WAAS's protection on ports identified in the unprotected web apps report in *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
+
NOTE: As an additional measure, you can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app to also include the ports that may not have been detected automatically.
+
NOTE: By enabling both *Automatically detect ports* and *API endpoint discovery*, you can monitor your API endpoints and ports without having to add an application and without configuring any policies. 

. *Save* the rule.

[.task]
=== Add an App (policy) to the rule

[.procedure]
. Select a WAAS rule to add an App in.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the *App Definition* tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

. If you do not have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.

.. In *Endpoint Setup*, click *Add Endpoint*.

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas-oob-tls.png[width=350]

.. Enter *Port* (optional, if you selected *Automatically detect ports* while creating the rule). When *Automatically detect ports* is selected, any ports specified in a protected endpoint definition will be appended to the list of protected ports.
+
Specify the TCP port listening for inbound HTTP traffic.

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP hostnames are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
The external port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic.

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api", etc. 

.. You can select the TLS protocol (1.0, 1.1, 1.2) to protect the API endpoint and enter the TLS certificate in PEM format.
+
*Limitations*
+
... TLS connections using extended_master_secret(23) in the negotiation are not supported as part of this feature.

... DHKE is not supported due to a lack of information required to generate the encryption key.

... Out-of-Band does not support HTTP/2 protocol.

... TLS inspection for Out-of-Band WAAS is not supported on earlier versions of Console and Defender.

.. Click *Create*

.. If your application requires xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection], select the "API Protection" tab and define for each path the allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions in the xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection] help page.

. Continue to *App Firewall* tab, and select the protections as shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::waas_out_of_band_app_firewall.png[width=750]
For more information, see xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc[App Firewall settings].

. Continue to *DoS protection* tab, and select <<../waas_dos_protection.adoc#,DoS protection>> to enable.

. Continue to *Access Control* tab, and select <<../waas_access_control.adoc#,access controls>> to enable.

. Continue to *Bot protection* tab, and select the protections as shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::waas_out_of_band_bot_protection.png[width=750]
For more information, see xref:../waas_bot_protection.adoc[Bot protections].

. Continue to *Custom rules* tab and select <<../waas_custom_rules.adoc#,Custom rules>> to enable.

. Continue to *Advanced settings* tab, and set the options shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::waas_out_of_band_advanced_settings.png[width=750]
For more information, see xref:../waas_advanced_settings.adoc[Advanced settings].

. Click *Save*.

. You should be redirected to the *Rule Overview* page.
+
Select the created new rule to display *Rule Resources* and for each application a list of *protected endpoints* and *enabled protections* are displayed.
+
image::waas_out_of_band_rule_overview.png[scale=20]

. Test protected endpoint using the following xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc#sanity_tests[sanity tests].

. Go to *Monitor > Events*, click on *WAAS for containers/hosts*, and observe the events generated.

[#actions]
=== WAAS Actions for Out-Of-Band traffic

The following actions are applicable for the HTTP requests or responses related to the *Out-Of-Band traffic*:

* *Alert* - An audit is generated for visibility.

* *Disable* - The WAAS action is disabled.

=== Troubleshooting

*No inspection generated by WAAS Out-Of-Band for TLS protocol*

Ensure that the requests use a supported TLS protocol and cipher suite, and respect the limitations listed in the Limitations section.
