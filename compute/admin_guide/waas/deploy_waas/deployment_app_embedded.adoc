== Deploy WAAS for Containers Protected By App-Embedded Defender

In some environments, Prisma Cloud Defender must be embedded directly inside the container it is protecting. This type of Defender is known as an App-Embedded Defender.
App-Embedded Defender can secure these types of containers with all WAAS protection capabilities.

The only difference is that App-Embedded Defender runs as a reverse proxy to the container it's protecting.
As such, when you set up WAAS for App-Embedded, you must specify the exposed external port where App-Embedded Defender can listen, and the port (not exposed to the Internet) where your web application listens.
WAAS for App-Embedded forwards the filtered traffic to your application's port - unless an attack is detected and you set your WAAS for App-Embedded rule to *Prevent*.

When testing your Prisma Cloud-protected container, be sure you update the security group's inbound rules to permit TCP connections on the external port you entered in the WAAS rule. This is the exposed port that allows you to access your web application's container.
To disable WAAS protection, disable the WAAS rule, and re-expose the application's real port by modifying the security group's inbound rule.

To embed App-Embedded WAAS into your container or Fargate task:

[.task]
=== Create a rule for App-Embedded

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > App-Embedded*.
+

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter a *Rule name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.

+
Collections define a combination of App IDs to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:

. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*.
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.

. *Save* the rule.

=== Add an App (policy) to the rule

Comment: the following section should be modified, removing any reference to 'auto detect ports', as this is not available. Additionally, it'll be good to remove the comment about Linux/Windows hosts, as they are out of context here
