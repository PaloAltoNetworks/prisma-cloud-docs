== Deploying WAAS for Containers Protected By App-Embedded Defender

In some environments, Prisma Cloud Defender must be embedded directly inside the container it is protecting. This type of Defender is known as App-Embedded Defender.
App-Embedded Defender can secure these types of containers with all WAAS protection capabilities.

The only difference is that App Embedded Defender runs as a reverse proxy to the container it's protecting.
As such, when you set up WAAS for App-Embedded, you must specify the exposed external port where App-Embedded Defender can listen, and the port (not exposed to the Internet) where your web application listens.
WAAS for App-Embedded forwards the filtered traffic to your application's port - unless an attack is detected and you set your WAAS for App Embedded rule to *Prevent*.

When testing your Prisma Cloud-protected container, be sure you update the security group's inbound rules to permit TCP connections on the external port you entered in the WAAS rule. This is the exposed port that allows you to access your web application's container.
To disable WAAS protection, disable the WAAS rule, and re-expose the application's real port by modifying the security group's inbound rule.

To embed App-Embedded WAAS into your container or Fargate task:

[.task]
=== Create a rule for App Embedded

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS*.

. Select the *App Embedded* tab.
+
image::waas_deployment_types_app_embedded.png[width=400]

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
+
image::waas_create_new_rule.png[width=400]
. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[width=400]
+
Collections define a combination of App IDs to which WAAS should attach itself in order to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_app_embedded_collection.png[width=550]

. *Save* the rule.

[.task]
=== Add an App (policy) for App Embedded

[.procedure]
. Select a WAAS App-Embedded rule to add an App in.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the App Definition tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints. If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click Import, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your app’s endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

. If you don’t have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.

.. In the *Endpoint Setup* tab, click on *Add Endpoint*.
+
image::cnaf_add_endpoint.png[width=550]

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas_endpoint_lineitem_app_embbded.png[width=550]

.. Enter *App port (required)*
+
Specify the TCP port protected app listens on, WAAS sends traffic to your app over this port.

.. Enter *WAAS Port (required)*.
+
External port is the TCP port for the App-Embedded Defender to listen on for inbound HTTP traffic.

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the the value of the external port is "80" non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.com", "docs.example.com", "www.example.com:8080", etc.  

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin/", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api/", etc.

.. If your application uses TLS, set *TLS* to *On*. 
+
WAAS must be able to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic to function properly. 
+
To facilitate that, after creating all endpoints click on *View TLS settings* in the endpoint setup menu
+ 
image::waas_tls_settings.png[width=550,align="left"]
+
TLS settings:
+
image::waas_tls_settings_detailed.png[width=550,align="left"]

... *Certificate* - Copy and paste your server's certificate and private key into the certificate input box (e.g. cat server-cert.pem server-key > certs.pem)..

... *Minimum TLS version* - A minimum version of TLS can be enforced by WAAS to prevent downgrading attacks (default value is "1.2").

... *HSTS* - The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)] response header lets web servers tell browsers to use HTTPS only, not HTTP.
When enabled, WAAS adds the HSTS response header to all HTTPS server responses (if not already present) with the preconfigured directives - `max-age`, `includeSubDomains` and `preload`.
+
* `max-age=<expire-time>` - The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
* `includeSubDomains` (optional) - If selected this HSTS protection applies to all of the site's subdomains as well.
* `preload` (optional) - for more details please refer to the following https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security#preloading_strict_transport_security[link].

.. If your application uses gRPC, set *gRPC* to *On*.

.. If your application uses HTTP/2, set *HTTP/2* to *On*. 

.. Click *Create Endpoint*

.. If your application requires xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection], select the "API Protection" tab and define for each path allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions in the xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection] help page.

.. Click on the *Response headers* tab to add or override HTTP response headers in responses sent from the protected application.

. Continue to *App Firewall* tab, select xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc[protections] to enable and assign them with <<actions>>.
+
image::waas_firewall_protections_with_banner.png[width=750]
. Continue to *Access Control* tab and select <<../waas_access_control.adoc#,access controls>> to enable.

. Continue to *DoS protection* tab and configure <<../waas_dos_protection.adoc#,DoS protection>> thresholds.

. Continue to *Bot protection* tab and select <<../waas_bot_protection.adoc#,bot protections>> to enable.

. Click *Save*.

. You should be redirected to the *Rule Overview* page.
+
Select the new rule to display *Rule Resources* and for each application a list of *protected endpoints* and *enabled protections*.
+
image::waas_rule_overview.png[width=650]

. Test protected container using the following xref:../waas/waas_app_firewall.adoc#sanity_tests[sanity tests].

. Go to *Monitor > Events*, click on *WAAS for App-Embedded* and observe events generated.
