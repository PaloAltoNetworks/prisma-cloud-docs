== Deploy WAAS for Hosts

To deploy WAAS to protect a host running a non-containerized web application, create a new rule, specify the host(s) where the application runs, define protected HTTP endpoints, and select protections.

[.task]
=== Create a WAAS rule for Hosts

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > Host*.

+

. Click *Add rule*.

.. Enter a *Rule Name* 

.. Enter *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.

.. Select *Operating system*

.. If necessary, adjust the *Proxy timeout*
+
NOTE: The maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire request, including the body. A 500 error response is returned if a request is not read within the timeout period. For applications dealing with large files, adjusting the proxy timeout is necessary.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[width=400]
+
Collections define a combination of hosts to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_host_collection.png[width=550]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all hosts using a wild card (`*`) is invalid and a waste of resources.
WAAS only needs to be applied to hosts that run applications that transmit and receive HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

. (Optional) Toggle to enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint.
+
When you select this option, WAAS deploys its protection on ports identified in the unprotected web apps report in *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
You can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app.

. (Optional) Toggle to enable *API endpoint discovery*.

. *Save* the rule.

[.task]
=== Add an App (policy) to the Host rule

[.procedure]
. Select a WAAS host rule to add an App in.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the App Definition tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
+
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click Import, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+

. If you don't have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.

.. In the *Endpoint Setup* tab, click on *Add Endpoint*
+
image::cnaf_add_endpoint.png[width=550]

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas_endpoint_lineitem.png[width=550]

.. Enter *Port* (optional, if you selected *Automatically detect ports* while creating the rule). When *Automatically detect ports* is selected, any ports specified in a protected endpoint definition will be appended to the list of protected ports.
+
Specify the TCP port protected app listens on, WAAS sends traffic to your app over this port.
+
NOTE: If your application uses *TLS* or *gRPC*, you must specify a port number.

.. Enter *WAAS Port (only required for Windows or when using xref:../waas_advanced_settings.adoc#remote-host["Remote host"] option)*.
+
Specify the TCP port on which WAAS listens. WAAS receives traffic from your end-users on this port, processes it, and then sends it to your app on the App port.
+
NOTE: Protecting Linux-based hosts does not require specifying a *`WAAS port`* since WAAS listens on the same port as the protected application.
Because of Windows internal traffic routing mechanisms WAAS and the protected application cannot use the same *`App port`*. Consequently, when protecting Windows-based hosts the *`WAAS port`* should be set to the port end-users send requests to, and the *`App port`* should be set to a *different* port on which the protected application would listen on and WAAS would forward traffic to.  

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the value of the external port is "80" for non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.site", "docs.example.site", "www.example.site:8080", etc. 

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin/", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api/", etc.

.. If your application uses TLS, set *TLS* to *On*. 
+
WAAS must be able to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic to function properly. 
+
To facilitate inspection, after creating all endpoints, click *View TLS settings* in the endpoint setup menu.
+

+
TLS settings:
+
image::waas_tls_settings_detailed.png[width=550,align="left"]

... *Certificate* - Copy and paste your server's certificate and private key into the certificate input box (e.g. cat server-cert.pem server-key > certs.pem).

... *Minimum TLS version* - Minimum version of TLS can be enforced by WAAS to prevent downgrading attacks (the default value is TLS 1.2).

... *HSTS* - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)] response header lets web servers tell browsers to use HTTPS only, not HTTP.
When enabled, WAAS adds the HSTS response header to all HTTPS server responses (if not already present) with the preconfigured directives - `max-age`, `includeSubDomains`, and `preload`.
+
* `max-age=<expire-time>` - Time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
* `includeSubDomains` (optional) - If selected, HSTS protection applies to all the site's subdomains as well.
* `preload` (optional) - For more details, refer to the following https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security#preloading_strict_transport_security[link].

.. If your application uses gRPC, set *gRPC* to *On*. 

.. If your application uses HTTP/2, set *HTTP/2* to *On*.

.. Click on the *Response headers* tab to add or override HTTP response headers in responses sent from the protected application.
+

.. Click *Create Endpoint*

.. If your application requires xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection], select the "API Protection" tab and define for each path allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions in the xref:../waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection] help page. 

. Continue to *App firewall* tab, select xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc[protections] to enable and assign them with xref:./deploy_waas[actions].
+

. Continue to *Access Control* tab and select <<../waas_access_control.adoc#,access controls>> to enable.

. Continue to *DoS protection* tab and configure <<../waas_dos_protection.adoc#,DoS protection>> thresholds.

. Continue to *Bot protection* tab and select <<../waas_bot_protection.adoc#,bot protections>> to enable.
. Click *Save*.

. You should be redirected to the *Rule Overview* page.
+
Select the created new rule to display *Rule Resources* and for each application a list of *protected endpoints* and *enabled protections*.
+
image::waas_rule_overview.png[width=650]

. Test protected endpoint using the following xref:../waas_app_firewall.adoc#sanity_tests[sanity tests].

. Go to *Monitor > Events*, click on *WAAS for hosts* and observe events generated.
