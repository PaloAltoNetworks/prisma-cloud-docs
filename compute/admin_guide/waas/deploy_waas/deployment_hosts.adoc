== Deploy WAAS In-Line for Hosts

To deploy WAAS to protect a host running a non-containerized web application, create a new rule, specify the host(s) where the application runs, define protected HTTP endpoints, and select protections.

[.task]
=== Create a WAAS In-Line rule for Hosts

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > Host > In-Line*.

. Click *Add rule*.

.. Enter a *Rule Name*

.. Enter *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.

.. Select *Operating system*

.. If necessary, adjust the *Proxy timeout*
+
NOTE: The maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire request, including the body. A 500 error response is returned if a request is not read within the timeout period. For applications dealing with large files, adjusting the proxy timeout is necessary.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.

Collections define a combination of hosts to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:

+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all hosts using a wild card (`*`) is invalid and a waste of resources.
WAAS only needs to be applied to hosts that run applications that transmit and receive HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*.
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.

. (Optional) Enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint.
+
When you select this option, WAAS deploys its protection on ports identified in the unprotected web apps report in *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
You can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app.
+
NOTE: *Automatically detect ports* is not available for Windows Operating System.

. *Save* the rule.

=== Add an App (policy) to the rule
