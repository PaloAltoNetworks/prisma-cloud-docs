== WAAS Sensitive Data

There may be sensitive data captured when WAAS events take place, such as access tokens, session cookies, PII, or other information considered to be personal by various laws and regulations.

By using WAAS sensitive data rules, users can mark *Sensitive data* and enable *Log scrubbing* based on regex patterns or its location in the HTTP request.
The data marked as sensitive will be flagged in API discovery, but will not be automatically scrubbed in the Logs.
To scrub the sensitive data in addition to marking it as sensitive, enable *Log scrubbing*, the data is scrubbed and replaced with placeholders in the logs before events are recorded.

NOTE: Scrubbing logs based on patterns only affect HTTP requests and not the responses.
The data from HTTP responses that appear in WAAS audits will not be scrubbed and replaced by the placeholder.

=== Add/Edit WAAS Scrubbing Rule

. Open the Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > Sensitive data*.

. Click on *Add rule* or select an existing rule.

. Enter Rule Name.

. Select rule type: pattern-based or location-based.

. For pattern-based rules:

+
NOTE: The pattern-based rule will match the given regex pattern by either "Request Parameter keys", or "Request Parameter Values" or "Response (Keys + Values)".
+
The pattern-matching feature for request parameter keys is only enabled for the Defender with a minimum version of 22.12.427.

.. Provide match pattern in the form of a regular expression (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[re2]), e.g. `^sessionID$`, `key-[a-zA-Z]{8,16}`.

.. Provide a placeholder string, e.g. `[scrubbed sessionID]`.
+
NOTE: Placeholder strings indicating the nature of the scrubbed data should be used as users will not be able to see the underlying scrubbed data.
+
NOTE: Scrubbing logs based on patterns will only affect HTTP requests and not the responses.
The data from HTTP responses that appear in WAAS audits will not be scrubbed and replaced by the placeholder.

. For location-based rules
+

.. Select the location of the data to be scrubbed.

.. Provide location details:

... For `query` / `cookie` / `header` / `form/multipart` - provide a match pattern in the form of a regular expression (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[re2]), e.g. `^SCookie.*$`, `item-[a-zA-Z]{8,16}`.

... For `XML (body)` / `JSON (body)` - provide the path using Prisma Cloud's custom format e.g. `/root/nested/id`. 

.. Provide a placeholder string, e.g. `[Scrubbed Session Cookie]`.
+
NOTE: Placeholder strings indicating the nature of the scrubbed data should be used, as users will not be able to see the underlying scrubbed data.
+

. Click *Save*.

*Sensitive Data & Log Scrubbing*
+
The location-based rule for sensitive data works by searching for the key value in the location, for example, query, cookie, header, form/multipart, XML, and JSON body.
For log scrubbing, WAAS replaces the value with the placeholder that you enter.
Data will now be scrubbed from any WAAS event before it is written (either to the Defender log or syslog) and sent to the console.
+
For example, the email ID is redacted in the below WAAS event audit.

[NOTE]
====
If sensitive data triggers events, both the forensic message and the recorded HTTP request are scrubbed.
Hence, placeholder strings indicating the nature of the scrubbed data should be used as users will not be able to see the underlying scrubbed data.
