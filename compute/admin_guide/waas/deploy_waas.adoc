== Deploying WAAS

WAAS (Web-Application and API Security) can secure both containerized and non-containerized web applications.
To deploy WAAS, create a new rule, and declare the entity to protect. 

Although the deployment method varies slightly depending on the type of entity you're protecting, the steps, in general, are:

. Define rule resource.
. Define application scope.
. Enable relevant protections.


=== Understanding WAAS rule resources and application scope

The WAAS rule engine is designed to let you tailor the best-suited protection for each part of your deployment. Each rule has two scopes:

* Rule resources.
* Application list.


==== Rule Resources

This scope defines, for each type of deployment, a combination of one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself in order to protect the web application:

* *_For containerized applications_* - Containers, images, namespaces, cloud account IDs, hosts. 
* *_For non-containerized applications_* - Host on which the application is running.
* *_For containers protected with App-Embedded Defender_* - App ID.
* *_For serverless functions_* - Function name.

NOTE: In the event of scope overlap (when multiple rules are applied to the same resource scope), the first rule by order will apply and all others will not apply. You can reorder rules via the `Order` column in WAAS rule tables by dragging and dropping rules.

==== Application List

This scope defines the protected application's endpoints within the deployment as a combination of one or more of the following:

* *_Port (Required)_* - For containerized applications, the internal port on which the application is listening. For all other types, the externally facing port.
* *_HTTP hostname_* - Default setting is set to `*` (wildcard indicating all hostnames)
* *_Base path_* - Lets you apply protection policy on certain paths of the application (e.g. "/admin", "/admin/*", etc.)
* *_TLS_* - TLS certificate to be used when expecting encrypted inbound traffic.

To better illustrate, consider the following deployment scenario for a web application running on-top of an NGINX cluster:

image::cnaf_deployment_example.png[width=650]

In this example, different policies apply for different parts of the application.
The steps for deploying a WAAS rule to protect the above described web application would be as follows:

. *Define rule resources* - Specify the resource collection the rule applies to. Collections are comprised of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself in order to protect the web application. In the following example, the rule will apply to all containers created by the nginx image. 
+
image::waas_nginx_scope.png[width=550]

. *Define protection policy for 'login', 'search' and 'product' endpoints* - Set OWASP Top 10 protection to "Prevent" and geo-based access control to "Alert".

. *Define protection policy for the application's API endpoints* - Set OWASP Top 10 and API protection to "Prevent" and HTTP header-based access control to "Alert".

Once the policy is defined, the rule overview shows the following rule resource and application definitions:

image::waas_rule_example.png[width=650]

* *_Rule Resources_* - Protection is applied to all NGINX images
* *_Apps List_* - We deployed two policies each covering a different endpoint in the application (defined by HTTP hostname, port and path combinations)


==== Protection evaluation flow

WAAS offers a range of protection targeted at different attack vectors.
Requests inspected by WAAS will be inspected in the following order of protections:

* Bot protection
* App firewall (OWASP Top-10)
* API protection 
* DoS protection

WAAS will continue to inspect a request until "Prevent" or "Ban" actions are triggered, at which point the request will be blocked, and the evaluation flow will be halted.

For instance, assume all protections in bot protection are set to "Prevent". An incoming request originating from a bot and containing a SQL injection payload would be blocked by the bot protection (since it precedes the app firewall in the evaluation flow), and the SQL injection payload will not be assessed by the app firewall.

In a different scenario, suppose that all bot protections are set to "Alert" and all app firewall protections are set to "Prevent". A request originating from a bot containing a command injection payload will generate an alert event by bot protection and will be blocked by the app firewall protection.

==== Deploying WAAS for Containers

To deploy WAAS for containerized web applications, create a new rule, specify the image name, define application endpoints and select protections. WAAS only needs to be applied to images that receive HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS*.

. Select the *Container* tab.
+
image::waas_deployment_types.png[width=400]

. Click *Add Rule*.

. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
+
image::waas_create_new_rule.png[width=400]

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[width=400]
+
Collections define a combination of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself in order to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_collection.png[width=550]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid - instead, only specify your web application images.

. Click *Add New App*.

. In the *App Definition* tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

. If you do not have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.

.. In the *General App Setup* tab, click *Add Endpoint*.
+
image::cnaf_add_endpoint.png[width=550]

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas_endpoint_lineitem.png[width=550]

.. Enter *Port (required)*
+
Specify the TCP port listening for inbound HTTP traffic.

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the the value of the external port is "80" for non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.site", "docs.example.site", "www.example.site:8080", etc. 

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on, when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api", etc.

.. If your application uses TLS, set *TLS* to *On*. 
+
WAAS must be able to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic to function properly. 
+
To facilitate inspection, after creating all endpoints, click *View TLS settings* in the endpoint setup menu.
+ 
image::waas_tls_settings.png[width=550,align="left"]
+
TLS settings:
+
image::waas_tls_settings_detailed.png[width=550,align="left"]

... *Certificate* - Copy and paste your server's certificate and private key into the certificate input box (e.g., `cat server-cert.pem server-key > certs.pem`).

... *Minimum TLS version* - A minimum version of TLS can be enforced by WAAS to prevent downgrading attacks (default value is TLS 1.2).

... *HSTS* - The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)] response header lets web servers tell browsers to use HTTPS only, not HTTP.
When enabled, WAAS would add the HSTS response header to all HTTPS server responses (if it is not already present) with the preconfigured directives - `max-age`, `includeSubDomains` and `preload`.
+
* `max-age=<expire-time>` - Time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
* `includeSubDomains` (optional) - If selected, HSTS protection applies to all the site's subdomains as well.
* `preload` (optional) - For more details, see the following https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security#preloading_strict_transport_security[link].

.. If your application uses gRPC, set *gRPC* to *On*. 

.. If your application uses HTTP/2, set *HTTP/2* to *On*. 

.. Click *Create Endpoint*

.. If your application requires xref:./waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection], select the "API Protection" tab and define for each path the allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions in the xref:./waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection] help page.

. Continue to *App Firewall* tab, select xref:./waas_app_firewall.adoc[protections] to enable and assign them with <<actions>>.
+
image::waas_firewall_protections_with_banner.png[width=750]

. Continue to *Access Control* tab and select <<./waas_access_control.adoc#,access controls>> to enable.

. Continue to *DoS protection* tab and configure <<./waas_dos_protection.adoc#,DoS protection>> thresholds.

. Continue to *Bot protection* tab and select <<./waas_bot_protection.adoc#,bot protections>> to enable.

. Click *Save*.

. You should be redirected to the *Rule Overview* page.
+
Select the created new rule to display *Rule Resources* and for each application a list of *protected endpoints* and *enabled protections*.

[.task]
==== Deploying WAAS for hosts

To deploy WAAS to protect a host running a non-containerized web application, create a new rule, specify the host(s) where the application runs, define protected HTTP endpoints and select protections.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS*.

. Select the *Host* tab
+
image::waas_deployment_types_host.png[width=400]

. Click *Add Rule*.
+
image::waas_create_new_rule.png[width=400]

.. Enter a *Rule Name* 

.. Enter *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.

.. Select *Operating system*

.. If necessary, adjust the *Proxy timeout*
+
NOTE: The maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire request, including the body. A 500 error response is returned if a request is not read within the timeout period. For applications dealing with large files, adjusting the proxy timeout is necessary.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[width=400]
+
Collections define a combination of hosts to which WAAS should attach itself in order to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_host_collection.png[width=550]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all hosts using a wild card (`*`) is invalid and a waste of resources.
WAAS only needs to be applied to hosts that run applications that transmit and receive HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

. Click *Add New App*.

. In the App Definition tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click Import, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

. If you don't have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specfying the host, port, and path.

.. In the *General App Setup* tab, click on *Add Endpoint*
+
image::cnaf_add_endpoint.png[width=550]

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas_endpoint_lineitem.png[width=550]

.. Enter *App Port (required)*.
+
Specify the TCP port protected app listens on, WAAS sends traffic to your app over this port.

.. Enter *WAAS Port (only required for Windows or when using xref:../waas/waas_advanced_settings.adoc#remote-host["Remote host"] option)*.
+
Specify the TCP port on which WAAS listens. WAAS receives traffic from your end users on this port, processes it, and then sends it to your app on the App port.
+
NOTE: Protecting Linux-based hosts does not require specifying a *`WAAS port`* since WAAS listens on the same port as the protected application.
Because of Windows internal traffic routing mechanisms WAAS and the protected application cannot use the same *`App port`*. Consequently, when protecting Windows-based hosts the *`WAAS port`* should be set to the port end-users send requests to and the *`App port`* should be set to a *different* port on which the protected application would listen on and WAAS would forward traffic to.  

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the value of the external port is "80" for non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.site", "docs.example.site", "www.example.site:8080", etc. 

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin/", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api/", etc.

.. If your application uses TLS, set *TLS* to *On*. 
+
WAAS must be able to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic to function properly.

==== Deploying WAAS for Containers Protected By App-Embedded Defender

In some environments, Prisma Cloud Defender must be embedded directly inside the container it is protecting. This type of Defender is known as App-Embedded Defender.
App-Embedded Defender can secure these types of containers with all WAAS protection capabilities.

The only difference is that App Embedded Defender runs as a reverse proxy to the container it's protecting.
As such, when you set up WAAS for App-Embedded, you must specify the exposed external port where App-Embedded Defender can listen, and the port (not exposed to the Internet) where your web application listens.
WAAS for App-Embedded forwards the filtered traffic to your application's port - unless an attack is detected and you set your WAAS for App Embedded rule to *Prevent*.

When testing your Prisma Cloud-protected container, be sure you update the security group's inbound rules to permit TCP connections on the external port you entered in the WAAS rule. This is the exposed port that allows you to access your web application's container.
To disable WAAS protection, disable the WAAS rule, and re-expose the application's real port by modifying the security group's inbound rule.

To embed App-Embedded WAAS into your container or Fargate task:

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS*.

. Select the *App Embedded* tab.

==== Deploying WAAS for serverless functions

When Serverless Defender is embedded in a function, it offers built-in web application firewall (WAF) capabilities, including protection against:

* SQL injection (SQLi) attacks
* Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
* Command injection (CMDi) attacks
* Local file system inclusion (LFI) attacks
* Code injection attacks

NOTE: Some xref:./waas_app_firewall.adoc[protections] are not available for WAAS serverless deployment.

*Prerequisites:* You already xref:../install/install_defender/install_serverless_defender.adoc[embedded Serverless Defender] into your function.

[#actions]
=== WAAS Actions
HTTP requests that trigger WAAS protections are subject to one of the following actions:

* *Alert* - Request is passed to the protected application and an audit is generated for visibility.
* *Prevent* - Request is denied from reaching the protected application, an audit is generated and WAAS responds with an HTML banner indicating the request was blocked.
* *Ban* - Can be applied on either IP or <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session IDs>>. All requests originating from the same IP/Prisma Session to the protected application are denied for the configured time period (default is 5 minutes) following the last detected attack.

NOTE: A message at the top of the page indicates the entity by which the ban will be applied (IP or Prisma Session ID).

NOTE: To enable ban by Prisma Session ID, <<./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session,Prisma Session Cookies>> has to be enabled in the Advanced Settings tab. For more information please refer to the xref:./waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session[Advanced Settings] help page.

NOTE: WAAS implements state, which is required for banning user sessions by IP address.
Because Defenders do not share state, any application that is replicated across multiple nodes must enable IP address stickiness on the load balancer.


[#recommended_deployment_phases]
=== Recommended WAAS Deployment Phases
HTTP requests that trigger WAAS protections are subject to one of the following actions:

====== Phase-1:
Deploy WAAS in a test environment (preferably one that is as similar to production as possible). 

All protections will be set to "Alert".

__Requirements:__

* A way to test the application before deploying WAAS and verify that it's working properly, e.g. a working cURL command with the expected outcome.
* A certificate (public certificate and private key files in PEM format) is required if the application employs TLS.
* If you are planning to protect API endpoints, please provide API specification files if available (Swagger or OpenAPI 3)

====== Phase-2:
Allow WAAS to inspect traffic to the test environment for a few days, then regroup to examine triggers and findings. 

The goal here is to fine-tune protections so that they correspond with the design of the protected application.

This would also be a good way to assess the performance impact introduced by WAAS and compare it to the performance of the application prior to the deployment of WAAS .

__Requirements:__

* It is necessary to generate traffic to the test environment preferably requests that simulate real user messages.

====== Phase-3:
Following the successful completion of phases 1 and 2, we deploy WAAS on a small portion of production with the same configuration that we tested in the test environment. 

We then examine the findings after a few days and make any necessary adjustments to the policies.

====== Phase-4:
Deploying WAAS across the entire production deployment of the application.


[#connectivity_monitor]

=== WAAS connectivity monitor

xref:../waas/waas-intro.adoc[WAAS] connectivity monitor monitors the connection between WAAS and the protected application.

WAAS connectivity monitor aggregates data on pages served by WAAS and the application responses.

In addition, it provides easy access to WAAS related errors registered in the Defender logs (Defenders sends logs to the Console every hour).

The monitor tab becomes available when you click on an image or host protected by xref:../waas/waas-intro.adoc[WAAS]. 

image::waas_radar_monitor.png[width=1000]

* *Last updated* - Most recent time when WAAS monitoring data was sent from the Defenders to the Console (Defender logs are sent to the Console on an hourly basis). By clicking on the *refresh* button users can initiate sending of newer data.

* *Aggregation start time* - Time when data aggregation began. By clicking on the *reset* button users can reset all counters.

* *WAAS errors* - To view recent errors related to a monitored image or host, click the *View recent errors* link.

* *WAAS statistics:*

** __Incoming requests__ - Count of HTTP requests inspected by WAAS since the start of aggregation.

** __Forwarded requests__ - Count of HTTP requests forwarded by WAAS to the protected application.

** __Interstitial pages served__ - Count of interstitial pages served by WAAS (interstitial pages are served once xref:../waas/waas_advanced_settings.adoc#prisma_session[Prisma Sessions Cookies] are enabled).

** __reCAPTCHAs served__ - Count of reCAPTCHA challenges served by WAAS (when enabled as part of xref:../waas/waas_bot_protection.adoc[bot protection]).

* *Application statistics* 

** Count of server responses returned from the protected application to WAAS grouped by HTTP response code prefix 

** Count of timeouts (a timeout is counted when a request is forwarded by WAAS to the protected application with no response received within the set timeout period).


NOTE: Existing WAAS and application statistics counts will be lost once users reset the aggregation start time. *`Reset`* will *not* affect WAAS errors and will not cause recent errors to be lost.

NOTE: For further details on WAAS deployment, monitoring and troubleshooting please refer to the xref:../waas/deploy_waas.adoc[WAAS deployment page]
