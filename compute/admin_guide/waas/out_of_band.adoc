== Deploying WAAS out of band

In out of band mode, WAAS does not proxy traffic to or from the protected application and all the detections are applied on a read-only copy of the traffic. 
As a result, there is no risk of interfering with the application flow. Out-of-band WAAS rules inspect HTTP requests and responses using a mirror of the traffic to provide WAAS detections.
To mirror traffic for out-of-band inspection, you can use Prisma Cloud Compute Defenders without any additional configuration, or use AWS VPC traffic mirroring.


[.task]
=== Create a WAAS rule for Out of band network traffic

To deploy WAAS for an out of band network traffic, create a new rule, define application endpoints, and select protections.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS*.

. Select the *Out of band* tab.
+

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.
+
image::waas_create_new_rule.png[width=400]

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[width=400]
+
Collections define a combination of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself in order to protect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_collection.png[width=550]

. (Optional) Toggle to enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint.
+
When you select this option, WAAS deploys its protection on ports identified in the unprotected web apps report in *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
You can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app.

. (Optional) Toggle to enable *API endpoint discovery*.

. (Optional) Toggle to enable *VPC traffic monitoring* to copy network traffic from the elastic network interface of an AWS EC2 instance.
+
WAAS is able to observe a mirror of HTTP traffic flowing to and from AWS instances even if they are not protected by a Prisma Cloud Compute Defender. To enable out of band protection using VPC traffic mirroring, you need to deploy one or more Prisma Cloud Compute observers onto which traffic will be mirrored. Observers inspect traffic and send audits of any events they identify to the console.
For more information, see the <<CloudFormation traffic mirroring examples>> section.

. *Save* the rule.
+
NOTE: If you have enabled both *API endpoint discovery* and *Automatically detect ports*, you don't need to add an app. The Prisma Cloud will automatically detect the app.

[#actions]
=== WAAS Actions for out of band traffic

The following actions are applicable for the HTTP requests or response related to the *out of band traffic*:

* *Alert* - An audit is generated for visibility.

* *Disable* - The WAAS action is disabled.

[.task]
=== Add an application to the rule

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS* > *Out of band*.

. Select a rule to add an application.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the *App Definition* tab, specify the endpoints in your web application that should be protected.
Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load.
Otherwise, skip to the next step to manually define your application's endpoints.
+
image::cnaf_import_swagger.png[width=350]

. If you do not have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.

.. In the *Endpoint Setup* tab, click *Add Endpoint*.
+
image::cnaf_add_endpoint.png[width=550]

.. Specify endpoint details:
+
image::waas_endpoint_lineitem.png[width=550]

.. Enter *Port* (optional, if you selected *Automatically detect ports* while creating the rule)
+
Specify the TCP port listening for inbound HTTP traffic.

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP host names are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
External port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the the value of the external port is "80" for non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.site", "docs.example.site", "www.example.site:8080", etc. 

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match on, when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api", etc. 

.. Click *Create Endpoint*

.. If your application requires xref:./waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection], select the "API Protection" tab and define for each path the allowed methods, parameters, types, etc. See detailed definition instructions in the xref:./waas_api_protection.adoc[API protection] help page.

. Continue to *App Firewall* tab, select the protections as shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::waas_out_of_band_app_firewall.png[width=750]
For more information, see xref:./waas_app_firewall.adoc[App Firewall settings].

. Continue to *DoS protection* tab and select <<./waas_dos_protection.adoc#,DoS protection>> to enable.

. Continue to *Access Control* tab and select <<./waas_access_control.adoc#,access controls>> to enable.

. Continue to *Bot protection* tab, select the protections as shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::waas_out_of_band_bot_protection.png[width=750]
For more information, see xref:./waas_bot_protection.adoc[Bot protections].

. Continue to *Custom rules* tab and select <<./waas_custom_rules.adoc#,Custom rules>> to enable.

. Continue to *Advanced settings* tab, set the options shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::waas_out_of_band_advanced_settings.png[width=750]
For more information, see xref:./waas_advanced_settings.adoc[Advanced settings].

. Click *Save*.

. You should be redirected to the *Rule Overview* page.
+
Select the created new rule to display *Rule Resources* and for each application a list of *protected endpoints* and *enabled protections*.
+
image::waas_out_of_band_rule_overview.png[width=650]

. Test protected endpoint using the following xref:../waas/waas_app_firewall.adoc#sanity_tests[sanity tests].

. Go to *Monitor > Events*, click on *WAAS for Out of band* and observe events generated.
