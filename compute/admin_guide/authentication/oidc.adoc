== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Open ID Connect

OpenID Connect is an standard that extends OAuth 2.0 to add an identity layer.
Prisma Cloud supports integration with any standard Open ID Connect (OIDC) provider that implements both OpenID connect core and OpenID connect discovery.
Instructions for integrating with PingOne and Okta are shown here.

Prisma Cloud supports the authorization code flow only.


=== PingOne

Integrate with PingOne.

You need to configure Compute as an OIDC app.
When configuring your app:

* The Start SSO URL must point to \https://<CONSOLE>:<PORT>/callback.
* The Redirect URI must point to \https://<CONSOLE>:<PORT>/api/v1/authenticate/callback/oidc.
* UserInfo must include sub, idpid, name.
* All of the following scopes must be included for OpenID: OpenID Connect (openid), OpenID profile, OpenID Email, OpenID address, OpenID Phone, Groups.

[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud to OIDC user identity mapping

Create a Prisma Cloud user for every user that should have access to Prisma Cloud.
Prisma Cloud uses the sub attribute that comes from OIDC to match the username configured in the Prisma Cloud database (as required by the OIDC spec).
Whichever value the provider is configured to send to Prisma Cloud should be used to configure users. 

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add User*.

. Set *Username* to the GitHub user name.

. Set *Auth method* to *OpenID Connect*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] for the user.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OpenID Connect*, and then click *Login*.

.. You're redirected to your OIDC provider to authenticate.

.. After successfully authenticating, you're logged into Prisma Cloud Console.


[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud to OIDC provider group mapping

When you use groups to assign roles in Prisma Cloud you don't have to create individual Prisma Cloud accounts for each user.
The group value configured on the Compute side should reflect the name of the group scope in the OIDC provider.
It might be something different than groups.

Groups can be associated and authenticated with by multiple identity providers.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

. Click *Add Group*.

. In *Name*, enter an OpenShift group name.

. In *Authentication method*, select *External Providers*.

. In *Authentication Providers*, select *OpenID Connect group*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] for the members of the group.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OpenID Connect*, and then click *Login*.
