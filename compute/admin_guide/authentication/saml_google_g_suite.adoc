== Integrate Google G Suite via SAML 2.0 federation

Many organizations use SAML to authenticate users for web services.
Prisma Cloud supports the SAML 2.0 federation protocol to access the Prisma Cloud Console.
When SAML support is enabled, users can log into Console with their federated credentials.
This article provides detailed steps for federating your Prisma Cloud Console with Google G Suite.

The Prisma Cloud/G Suite SAML federation flow works as follows:

. Users browse to Prisma Cloud Console.

. Their browsers are redirected to the G Suite SAML 2.0 endpoint.

. They enter their credentials to authenticate.
Multi-factor authentication can be enforced at this step.

. A SAML token is returned to Prisma Cloud Console.

. Prisma Cloud Console validates the SAML tokenâ€™s signature and associates the user to their Prisma Cloud account via user identity mapping or group membership.
