== Azure Credentials

This section discusses Azure credentials.

[.task]
=== Authenticate with Azure using a certificate

You can authenticate with Azure using a certificate as a secret.
As with password authentication, the certificate is stored with the Azure service principal.
For more information, see the Microsoft docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#use-with-certificate[here].

[.procedure]
. Log into Compute Console.

. Go to *Manage > Cloud accounts*

. Click *Add account*.

. In *Select cloud provider*, choose *Azure*.

. Enter a name for the credential.

. In *Subtype*, select *Certificate*.

. In *Certificate*, enter your service principal's certificate in PEM format.
+
The certificate must include the private key.
Concatenate public cert with private key (e.g., cat client-cert.pem client-key.pem).

. Enter a tenant ID.

. Enter a client ID.

. Enter a subscription ID.

. Click *Next*.

. In *Scan account*, disable *Agentless scanning*.

. Click *Next*.

. Click *Add account*.

. Validate the credential.
+
Your Azure credential is now available to be used in the various integration points in the product, including registry scanning, serverless function scanning, and so on.
If authentication with a certificate is supported, it's shown in the credential drop-down in the setup dialog.
For example, the following screenshot shows the setup dialog for scanning Azure Container Registry:

After setting up your integrations, you can review how and where the credential is being used by going to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials store* and clicking on the credential.

[.task]
=== Create an Azure Service Principal

Create an Azure Service Principal so that Prisma Cloud Console can scan your Azure tenant for microservices.
To get a service key:

[.procedure]
. Download and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[install the Azure CLI].

. Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources.

  $ az ad sp create-for-rbac \
    --name <user>-twistlock-azure-cloud-discovery-<contributor|reader> \
    --role <reader|contributor> \
    --scopes /subscriptions/<yourSubscriptionID> \
    --create-cert
+
The *--role* value depends upon the type of scanning:
+
* contributor = Cloud Discovery + Azure Container Registry Scanning + Azure Function Apps Scanning
* reader = Cloud Discovery + Azure Container Registry Scanning

. Copy the output of the command and save it to a text file.
You will use the output as the *Service Key* when creating an Azure credential.
