=== Authenticate with Azure using a certificate

You can authenticate with Azure using a certificate as a secret.
As with password authentication, the certificate is stored with the Azure service principal.
For more information, see the Microsoft docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#use-with-certificate[here].

[.procedure]
. Log into Compute Console.

. Go to *Manage > Cloud accounts* 

. Click *Add account*.

. In *Select cloud provider*, choose *Azure*.

. Enter a name for the credential.

. In *Subtype*, select *Certificate*.

. In *Certificate*, enter your service principal's certificate in PEM format.
+
The certificate must include the private key.
Concatenate public cert with private key (e.g., cat client-cert.pem client-key.pem).

Your Azure credential is now available to be used in the various integration points in the product, including registry scanning, serverless function scanning, and so on.
If authentication with a certificate is supported, it's shown in the credential drop-down in the setup dialog.
For example, the following screenshot shows the setup dialog for scanning Azure Container Registry:
