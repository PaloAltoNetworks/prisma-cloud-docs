=== Authenticate with Azure using a certificate

You can authenticate with Azure using a certificate as a secret.
As with password authentication, the certificate is stored with the Azure service principal.
For more information, see the Microsoft docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#use-with-certificate[here].

. In *Select cloud provider*, choose *Azure*.

. Enter a name for the credential.

. In *Subtype*, select *Certificate*.

The certificate must include the private key.

Your Azure credential is now available to be used in the various integration points in the product, including registry scanning, serverless function scanning, and so on.
If authentication with a certificate is supported, it's shown in the credential drop-down in the setup dialog.
For example, the following screenshot shows the setup dialog for scanning Azure Container Registry:
