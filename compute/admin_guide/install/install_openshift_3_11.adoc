=== Preflight checklist

To ensure that your installation goes smoothly, work through the following checklist and validate that all requirements are met.

[.section]
==== Minimum system requirements

Validate that the components in your environment (nodes, host operating systems, orchestrator) meet the specs in
xref:../install/system_requirements.adoc[System requirements].

ifdef::compute_edition[]
IMPORTANT: For OpenShift installs, we recommend using the overlay or overlay2 storage drivers due to a known issue in RHEL.
For more information, see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518519.
endif::compute_edition[]


[.section]
==== Permissions
Validate that you have permission to:

* Push to a private docker registry.
For most OpenShift setups, the registry runs inside the cluster as a service.
You must be able to authenticate with your registry with docker login.

* Pull images from your registry.
This might require the creation of a docker-registry secret.

* Have the correct role bindings to pull and push to the registry.
For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/registry/accessing_registry.html[Accessing the Registry].

* Create and delete projects in your cluster.
For OpenShift installations, a project is created when you run _oc new-project_.

* Run _oc create_ commands.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
[.section]
==== Internal cluster network communication
TCP: 8083, 8084

[.section]
==== External cluster network communication
TCP: 443

The Prisma Cloud Console connects to the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream (https://intelligence.twistlock.com) on TCP port 443 for vulnerability updates.
If your Console is unable to contact the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream, follow the guidance for xref:../tools/update_intel_stream_offline.adoc[offline environments].
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
[.section]
==== Network connectivity

Validate that outbound connections to your Console can be made on port 443.

=== Install Prisma Cloud

ifdef::compute_edition[]
Use xref:../tools/twistcli.adoc[_twistcli_] to install the Prisma Cloud Console and Defenders.
The _twistcli_ utility is included with every release.
After completing this procedure, both Prisma Cloud Console and Prisma Cloud Defenders will be running in your OpenShift cluster.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
Use xref:../tools/twistcli.adoc[_twistcli_] to install the Prisma Cloud Defenders in your OpenShift cluster.
The _twistcli_ utility is included with every release.
endif::prisma_cloud[]


ifdef::compute_edition[]
[.task]
==== Download the Prisma Cloud software

Download the latest Prisma Cloud release to any system where the OpenShift https://www.okd.io/download.html[oc client] is installed.

[.procedure]
. Go to xref:../welcome/releases.adoc[Releases], and copy the link to current recommended release.

. Download the release tarball to your cluster controller.

  $ wget <LINK_TO_CURRENT_RECOMMENDED_RELEASE_LINK>

. Unpack the release tarball.

  $ mkdir twistlock
  $ tar xvzf twistlock_<VERSION>.tar.gz -C twistlock/

endif::compute_edition[]


[.task]
==== Create an OpenShift project for Prisma Cloud

Create a project named _twistlock_.

[.procedure]
. Login to the OpenShift cluster and create the _twistlock_ project:

  $ oc new-project twistlock


[.task]
==== (Optional) Push the Prisma Cloud images to a private registry

When Prisma Cloud is deployed to your cluster, the images are retrieved from a registry.
You have a number of options for storing the Prisma Cloud Console and Defender images:

* OpenShift internal registry.

* Private Docker v2 registry.
You must create a docker-secret to authenticate with the registry.

Alternatively, you can pull the images from the xref:../install/twistlock_container_images.adoc[Prisma Cloud cloud registry] at deployment time.
Your cluster nodes must be able to connect to the Prisma Cloud cloud registry (registry-auth.twistlock.com) with TLS on TCP port 443.

This guides shows you how to use both the OpenShift internal registry and the Prisma Cloud cloud registry.
If you're going to use the Prisma Cloud cloud registry, you can skip this section.
Otherwise, this procedure shows you how to pull, tag, and upload the Prisma Cloud images to the OpenShift internal registry's _twistlock_ imageStream.

[.procedure]
. Determine the endpoint for your OpenShift internal registry.
Use either the internal registry's service name or cluster IP.

  $ oc get svc -n default
  NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)       AGE
  docker-registry    ClusterIP   172.30.163.181   <none>        5000/TCP      88d

ifdef::compute_edition[]
. Pull the images from the Prisma Cloud cloud registry using your access token.
The major, minor, and patch numerals in the <VERSION> string are separated with an underscore.
For exampe, 18.11.128 would be 18_11_128.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
==== Install Console

Use the _twistcli_ tool to generate the Prisma Cloud Console Kubernetes deployment YAML or helm chart.
The _twistcli_ tool is bundled with the release tarball.
There are versions for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The _twistcli_ tool generates YAML files or helm charts for a Deployment and other service configurations, such as a PersistentVolumeClaim, SecurityContextConstraints, and so on.
Run the twistcli command with the _--help_ flag for additional details about the command and supported flags.

You can optionally customize _twistlock.cfg_ to enable additional features.
Then run twistcli from the root of the extracted release tarball.

Prisma Cloud Console uses a PersistentVolumeClaim to store data.
There are two ways to provision storage for Console:

* *Dynamic provisioning:*
Allocate storage for Console link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html[on-demand] at deployment time.
When generating the Console deployment YAML files or helm chart with _twistcli_, specify the name of the storage class with the _--storage-class_ flag.
Most customers use dynamic provisioning.

* *Manual provisioning:*
Pre-provision a persistent volume for Console, then specify its label when generating the Console deployment YAML files.
OpenShift uses NFS mounts for the backend infrastructure components (e.g. registry, logging, etc.).
The NFS server is typically one of the master nodes.
Guidance for creating an NFS backed PersistentVolume can be found link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html#overview[here].
Also see <<Appendix: NFS PersistentVolume example>>.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
==== Install Defender

Prisma Cloud Defenders run as containers on the nodes in your OpenShift cluster.
They are deployed as a DaemonSet.
Use the _twistcli_ tool to generate the DaemonSet deployment YAML or helm chart.

The command has the following basic structure
It creates a YAML file named _defender.yaml_  or a Helm chart named _twistlock-defender-helm.tar.gz_ in the working directory.

Example for export of a YAML file:

  $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export openshift \
    --address <ADDRESS> \
    --cluster-address <CLUSTER-ADDRESS>

Example for export of a Helm chart:

  $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export openshift \
    --address <ADDRESS> \
    --cluster-address <CLUSTER-ADDRESS> \
    --helm

The command connects to Console’s API, specified in _--address_, to generate the Defender DaemonSet YAML config file or Helm chart.
The location where you run twistcli (inside or outside the cluster) dictates which Console address should be supplied.

The _--cluster-address_ flag specifies the address Defender uses to connect to Console.
For Defenders deployed inside the cluster, specify Prisma Cloud Console’s service name, twistlock-console or twistlock-console.twistlock.svc, or cluster IP address.
For Defenders deployed outside the cluster, specify either Console’s external address, which is exposed by your external route.

If SELinux is enabled on the OpenShift nodes, pass the _--selinux-enabled_ argument to twistcli.

For managed clusters, Prisma Cloud automatically gets the cluster name from the cloud provider.
To override the the cloud provider’s cluster name, use the _--cluster_ option.
For self-managed clusters, manually specify a cluster name with the _--cluster_ option.

=== Control Defender deployments with Taint

You can deploy Defenders to all nodes in an OpenShift cluster (master, infra, compute).
OpenShift Container Platform automatically taints infra and master nodes, these taints have the NoSchedule effect which means no pod can be scheduled on them.
In order to run the defenders on thses nodes you will need to remove the taint. Once this is done, the defender's Daemonset will automatically be deployed on them (no need for redeployment of the Daemonset).
Adjust the guidance in the following procedure according to your organization's deployment strategy.

Option 1 - remove taint all nodes:

  oc adm taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-

Option 2 - remove taint from specific nodes:

  oc adm taint nodes <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/master-

=== Appendix: NFS PersistentVolume example

Create an NFS mount for the Prisma Cloud Console's PV on the host that serves the NFS mounts.

[.procedure]
. *mkdir /opt/twistlock_console*

. Check selinux: *sestatus*

. *chcon -R -t svirt_sandbox_file_t -l s0 /opt/twistlock_console*

. *sudo chown nfsnobody /opt/twistlock_console*

. *sudo chgrp nfsnobody /opt/twistlock_console*

. Check perms with: *ls -lZ /opt/twistlock_console* (drwxr-xr-x. nfsnobody nfsnobody system_u:object_r:svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0)

. Create */etc/exports.d/twistlock.exports*

. In the */etc/exports.d/twistlock.exports* add in line */opt/twistlock_console *(rw,root_squash)*

. Restart nfs mount *sudo exportfs -ra*

. Confirm with *showmount -e*

. Get the IP address of the Master node that will be used in the PV (eth0, openshift uses 172. for node to node communication).
Make sure TCP 2049 (NFS) is allowed between nodes.

. Create a PersistentVolume for Prisma Cloud Console.
+
The following example uses a label for the PersistentVolume and the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html#persistent-volumes-volumes-and-claim-prebinding[volume and claim pre-binding] features.
The PersistentVolumeClaim uses the `app-volume: twistlock-console` label to bind to the PV.
The volume and claim pre-binding `claimref` ensures that the PersistentVolume is not claimed by another PersistentVolumeClaim before Prisma Cloud Console is deployed.

=== Appendix: Implementing SAML federation with a Prisma Cloud Console inside an OpenShift cluster

When federating Prisma Cloud Console that is accessed through an OpenShift external route with a SAML v2.0 Identity Provider (IdP), the SAML authentication request's _AssertionConsumerServiceURL_ value must be modified.
Prisma Cloud automatically generates the _AssertionConsumerServiceURL_ value sent in a SAML authentication request based on Console's configuration.
When Console is accessed through an OpenShift external route, the URL for Console's API endpoint is most likely not the same as the automatically generated _AssertionConsumerServiceURL._
Therefore, you must configure the _AssertionConsumerServiceURL_ value that Prisma Cloud sends in the SAML authentication request.

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > SAML*.

. In *Console URL*, define the _AssertionConsumerServiceURL_.
+
In this example, enter _\https://twistlock-console.apps.ose.example.com_
