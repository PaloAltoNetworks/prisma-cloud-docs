== Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

To install Prisma Cloud on https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/#[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)], use the standard Kubernetes install flow.
Before getting started, create a `ClusterRoleBinding`, which grants the permissions required to create the Defender `DaemonSet`.

[NOTE]
====
For GKE Autopilot, follow the <<_gke-autopilot,Autopilot steps>>.
====

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account that you use to create the Prisma Cloud Console resources, including Deployment controller and PersistentVolumeClaim, must have at least the *Kubernetes Engine Developer* role to be successful.

The GCP service account that you use to create the Defender resources, including `DaemonSet`, must have the Kubernetes cluster-admin role.
If you try to create the Defender resources from a service account without this cluster-specific role, it will fail because the GCP *Kubernetes Engine Developer* role doesn't grant the developer sufficient permissions to create a ClusterRole (one of the Defender resources).
You'll need to use an account with the GCP *Kubernetes Engine Admin* role to bind the Kubernetes cluster-admin role to your Kubernetes developer's service account.

It's probably best to create the ClusterRoleBinding before turning the cluster over any user (typically DevOps) tasked with managing and maintaining Prisma Cloud.

[NOTE]
====
Run the command in the following procedure on ANY service account that attempts to apply the Defender `DaemonSet` YAML or Helm chart, even if that service account already has elevated permissions with the GCP *Kubernetes Engine Admin* role.
Otherwise, you'll get an error.
====

The following procedure uses a service account named `your-dev-user@your-org.iam.gserviceaccount.com` that has the GCP *Kubernetes Engine Developer* role.
You'll also need access to a more privileged GCP account that has the *Kubernetes Engine Admin* role to create the `ClusterRoleBinding` in your cluster.

*Prerequisites*

* You have deployed a GKE cluster.
* You have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account with the *Kubernetes Engine Developer* role.
* You have access to a GCP account with at least the *Kubernetes Engine Admin* role.
* Prepare your workloads for https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/prepare-arm-workloads-for-deployment#node-affinity-multi-arch-arm[multiple architectures in GKE].

[.procedure]
. With the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account#[service account] that has the GCP *Kubernetes Engine Admin* role set as the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config/set#[active account], run:

$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding your-dev-user-cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user=your-dev-user@your-org.iam.gserviceaccount.com

. With the *Kubernetes Engine Developer* service account, continue with the standard Kubernetes install procedure for Prisma Cloud Console and Defenders, <<_install_console,starting here>>.

=== Troubleshooting

If you see the following error when trying to create the Defender DaemonSet, you've probably tried to create the Defender resources from a service account that has the GCP *Kubernetes Engine Developer* role.
To fix the issue, grant the <<_gke,proper cluster role>> to the service account.
