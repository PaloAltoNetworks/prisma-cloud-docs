== Install the Prisma Cloud Defender

To install the Prisma Cloud Defender, deploy the Defenders as `DaemonSet` custom resources.
This approach ensures that a Defender instance runs on every node in the cluster.
To deploy the Prisma Cloud Defender, use a macOS or Linux cluster controller with `kubectl` enabled and follow these steps:

. Use the `twistcli` command-line utility to generate the `DaemonSet` YAML configuration file for the Defender.
. Deploy the generated custom resource with `kubectl`.

This approach is called declarative object management. 
It allows you to work directly with the YAML configuration files. 
The benefit is that you get the full source code for the custom resources you create in your cluster, and you can use a version control tool to manage and track modifications.
With YAML configuration files under version control, you can delete and reliably recreate `DaemonSets` in your environment.

If you don't have `kubectl` access to your cluster, you can deploy Defender `DaemonSets` directly from the xref:../install/install_defender/install_cluster_container_defender.adoc[Console UI]. 

This procedure shows you how to deploy Defender `DaemonSets` using the `twistcli` command-line utitily and declarative object management.
You can also generate the installation commands using the Prisma Cloud Console UI under  *Manage > Defenders > Deploy > DaemonSet*.
The installation scripts are only supported on Linux hosts.
Use the `twistcli` command-line utility to generate the Defender `DaemonSet` YAML configuration files for macOS and Windows hosts. Deploy the cusjtom resources with `kubectl` following this procedure.

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
[.procedure]
. Get the `PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_CONSOLE_URL` value.

.. xref:../Sign into Prisma Cloud.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Utilities*.

.. Copy the URL under *Path to Console*.

. Retrieve Console's hostname (PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_HOSTNAME).
+
The hostname can be derived from the URL by removing the protocol scheme and path.
It is simply the host part of the URL. You can also retrieve the hostname directly.

.. Go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Deploy > Defenders > Orchestrator*

.. Select *Kubernetes* from *Step 2* (*Choose the orchestrator type*)

.. Copy the hostname from *Step 3* (*The name that Defender will use to connect to this Console*)

. Generate a _defender.yaml_ file, where:
+
Connect to Prisma Cloud Console specified in `--address` as the <ADMIN> user specified in `--user`. and generates a Defender `DaemonSet` custom resource YAML config file according to the configuration options passed to `twistcli`.
The _--cluster-address_ option specifies the address Defender uses to connect to Console.
+
  $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export kubernetes \
    --user <ADMIN_USER> \
    --address <PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_CONSOLE_URL> \
    --cluster-address <PRISMA_CLOUD_COMPUTE_HOSTNAME>
+
[NOTE]
====
For provider managed clusters, Prisma Cloud automatically gets the cluster name from your cloud provider.
To override the cluster name used that your cloud provider has, use the `--cluster` option.
For self-managed clusters, such as those built with kops, manually specify a cluster name with the `--cluster` option.
====
+
* <PLATFORM> can be `linux`, `osx`, or `windows`.
* <ADMIN_USER> is the name of a Prisma Cloud user with the System Admin role.
+
[NOTE]
====
When using the CRI-O or `containerd` runtimes, pass the `--cri` flag to the `twistcli` command-line utility when you generate the YAML configuration file or the Helm chart.
When using an AWS Bottlerocket-based EKS cluster, pass the `--cri` flag when creating the YAML.
====

. Deploy the Defender `DaemonSet` custom resource.

   $ kubectl create -f ./defender.yaml

.  In Prisma Cloud, go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Manage > DaemonSets* to see a list of deployed Defenders.

NOTE: You can run both Prisma Cloud Console and Defenders in the same Kubernetes namespace (e.g. _twistlock_).
Be careful when running _kubectl delete_ commands with the YAML file generated for Defender.
This file contains the namespace declaration, so comment out the namespace section if you don't want the namespace deleted.

[.procedure]
. Determine the Console service's external IP address.
+
[userinput]
----
$ kubectl get service -o wide -n twistlock
----

. Generate a _defender.yaml_ file, where:
+
The following command connects to Console (specified in _--address_) as user <ADMIN> (specified in _--user_), and generates a Defender `DaemonSet` custom resource YAML config file according to the configuration options passed to _twistcli_.
+
The _--cluster-address_ option specifies the address Defender uses to connect to Console.
For Defenders deployed in the cluster where Console runs, specify Prisma Cloud Console's service name, _twistlock-console_.
For Defenders deployed outside the cluster, specify either Console's external IP address, exposed by the LoadBalancer, or better, Console's DNS name, which you must manually set up separately.
+
The following command directs Defender to connect to Console using its service name.
Use it for deploying a Defender `DaemonSet` custom resource inside a cluster.
+
[userinput]
----
$ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export kubernetes \
  --user <ADMIN_USER> \
  --address https://yourconsole.example.com:8083 \
  --cluster-address twistlock-console
----
+
* <PLATFORM> can be linux or osx.
* <ADMIN_USER> is the name of the initial admin user you just created.

ifdef::kubernetes[]
. (Optional) Schedule Defenders on your Kubernetes master nodes.
+
If you want to also schedule Defenders on your Kubernetes master nodes, change the DaemonSet's toleration spec.
Master nodes are tainted by design.
Only pods that specifically match the taint can run there.
Tolerations allow pods to be deployed on nodes to which taints have been applied.
To schedule Defenders on your master nodes, add the following tolerations to your DaemonSet spec.
+
  tolerations:
  - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

. Deploy the Defender `DaemonSet` custom resource.

   $ kubectl create -f defender.yaml

.  Open a browser, navigate to Console, then go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage* to see a list of deployed Defenders.
