== Cluster context

Prisma Cloud can segment your environment by cluster.
For example, you might have three clusters: test, staging, and production.
The cluster pivot in Prisma Cloud lets you inspect resources and administer security policy on a per-cluster basis.

Defenders in each DaemonSet are responsible for reporting which resources belong to which cluster.
When deploying a Defender DaemonSet, Prisma Cloud tries to determine the cluster name through introspection.
First, it tries to retrieve the cluster name from the cloud provider.
As a fallback, it tries to retrieve the name from the corresponding kubeconfig file saved in the credentials store.
Finally, you can override these mechanisms by manually specifying a cluster name when deploying your Defender DaemonSet.

Both the Prisma Cloud UI and twistcli tool accept an option for manually specifying a cluster name.
Let Prisma Cloud automatically detect the name for provider-managed clusters.
Manually specify names for self-managed clusters, such as those built with kops.

Radar lets you explore your environment cluster-by-cluster.
You can also create stored filters (also known as xref:../configure/collections.adoc[collections]) based on cluster names.
Finally, you can scope policy by cluster.
Vulnerability and compliance rules for container images and hosts, runtime rules for container images, and trusted images rules can all be scoped by cluster name.

There are some things to consider when manually naming clusters:

* If you specify the same name for two or more clusters, they're treated as a single cluster.
* For GCP, if you have clusters with the same name in different projects, they're treated as a single cluster.
Consider manually specifying a different name for each cluster.
* Manually specifying names isn't supported in *Manage > Defenders > Manage > DaemonSet*. 
This page lets you deploy and manage DaemonSets directly from the Prisma Cloud UI.
For this deployment flow, cluster names are retrieved from the cloud provider or the supplied kubeconfig only.
