== Kubernetes

This topic helps you install Prisma Cloud in your Kubernetes cluster quickly.
There are many ways to install Prisma Cloud, but use this workflow to quickly deploy Defenders and verify how information is accessible from the Prisma Cloud Console.
After completing this procedure, you can modify the installation to match your needs.

To better understand clusters, read our xref:../../cluster-context.adoc[cluster context] topic.

To deploy Prisma Cloud Defenders, you use the xref:../../../tools/twistcli.adoc[command-line utility called `twistcli`], which is bundled with the Prisma Cloud software.
The process has the following steps to give you full control over the created objects.

. The `twistcli` utility generates YAML configuration files or Helm charts for the Defender.
. You create the required objects in your cluster with the `kubectl create` command.

You can inspect, customize, and manage the YAML configuration files or Helm charts before deploying the Prisma Cloud Console and Defender.
You can place the files or charts under source control to track changes, to integrate them with Continuos Integration and Continuos Development (CI/CD) pipelines, and to enable effective collaboration. 

Each Prisma Cloud Defender is deployed as a `DaemonSet` to ensure that a Prisma Cloud Defender instance runs on each worker node of your cluster.

=== Prerequisites

To deploy your Defenders smoothly, you must meet the following requirements.

* You have a valid Prisma Cloud license key and access token.

* You have a valid access key and secret key created for the admin user inside Prisma Cloud 

* You provisioned a Kubernetes cluster that meets the minimum xref:../../system_requirements.adoc[system requirements] and runs a xref:../../system_requirements.adoc#orchestrators[supported Kubernetes version].

* You set up a Linux or macOS system to control your cluster, and you can access the cluster using the `kubectl` command-line utility.

* The nodes in your cluster can reach Prisma Cloud's cloud registry at `registry-auth.twistlock.com`.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* Your cluster can create https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[PersistentVolumes] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/[LoadBalancers] from YAML configuration files or Helm charts.
endif::compute_edition[]

* Your cluster uses any of the following runtimes.
For more information about the runtimes that Prisma Cloud supports, see the xref:../../system_requirements.adoc#container-runtimes[system requirements].

** Docker Engine
** CRI-O
** CRI-containerd

* Install the xref:../../../tools/twistcli.adoc[Prisma Cloud command-line utility] called `twistcli`, which is bundled with the Prisma Cloud software. You use `twistcli` to deploy the Defenders.

==== Required Permissions

* You can create and delete namespaces in your cluster.

* You can run the `kubectl create` command.

==== Required Firewall and Port Configuration

Open the following ports in your firewall.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
Ports for the *Prisma Cloud Console*:

* Incoming: 8083, 8084
* Outgoing: 443, 53
endif::compute_edition[]

Ports for the *Prisma Cloud Defenders*:

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* Incoming: None
* Outgoing: 8084
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
* Incoming: None
* Outgoing: 443
endif::prisma_cloud[]

ifdef::compute_edition[]

To use Prisma Cloud as part of your Kubernetes deployment, you need the `twistcli` command-line utility and the Prisma Cloud Defenders.

Use the xref:../../../tools/twistcli.adoc[`twistcli`] command-line utility to install the Prisma Cloud Console and .
The `twistcli` utility is included with every release, or you can <<_download_twistlock,download the utility separately>>.
After completing this procedure, the Prisma Cloud Console and Prisma Cloud Defenders run in your Kubernetes cluster.

When you install Prisma Cloud on xref:install_amazon_ecs.adoc[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service] (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Alibaba Container Service with Kubernetes, additional configuration steps are required.

=== Install the Prisma Cloud Command-Line Utility

To use Prisma Cloud as part of your Kubernetes deployment, you need the `twistcli` command-line utility and the Prisma Cloud Defenders.

. Use the xref:../../../tools/twistcli.adoc[`twistcli`] command-line utility to deploy the Prisma Cloud Defenders in your Kubernetes cluster.
+
The `twistcli` utility is included with every Prisma Cloud release.

. Ensure that your cluster configuration allows the Defenders to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console service.
The Defenders connect to the Prisma Cloud Console service using a websocket over port `443` to retrieve policies and send data.

=== Install Prisma Cloud with Helm charts

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
You can use `twistcli` to create Helm charts for the Prisma Cloud Console and the Defenders.
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, and a `chart` is a Helm package.

Follow the <<_install_prisma_cloud,main install flow>>, with the following changes.

* Pass the `--helm_ option to _twistcli` to generate a Helm chart.
Don't change the other options passed to `twistcli` since they configure the chart.

* Deploy your Defender with the `helm install` command instead of `kubectl create`.

The following procedure shows the modified commands.

[.procedure]
. Create a Defender `DaemonSet` Helm chart.

  $ <PLATFORM>./twistcli defender export kubernetes \
    --address https://yourconsole.example.com:8083 \
    --helm \
    --user <ADMIN_USER_ACCESS_KEY> \
    --cluster-address twistlock-console \
    --container-runtime containerd

. Install the Defender.

  $ helm install twistlock-defender-ds \
    --namespace twistlock \ 
    --create-namespace \
    ./twistlock-defender-helm.tar.gz

=== Troubleshooting

==== Kubernetes CrashLoopBackOff Error

**Error**
  
  Back-off restarting failed container

To get the error logs, run the command: `kubectl describe pod[name]`.

**Reason**

This is caused due to a temporary memory resource overload.
When running WAAS Out-of-Band (OOB), the Defender automatically increases the `cgroup` memory limit to 4 GB (as OOB needs more memory). But since the Defenders' `cgroup` in K8s is hierarchically under the `cgroup` of the K8s pod with a limit of 512 MB, this results in an Out-Of-Memory error.

[.task]
==== Increase the Defender Pod Limit

Increase the Pod limit to 4 GB when activating WAAS OOB on K8s cluster.

[.procedure]

. **For running Defenders**
.. Run `kubectl edit ds twistlock-defender-ds -n twistlock` and change the value under *resources > limits > memory* to *4096Mi* in the Daemonset spec `*.yaml` file.
.. *Save* the file to restart the Defenders with the increased memory limit.

. **When deploying Defenders**
.. *With YAML*:
... Change the value of *resources > limits > memory* to *4096Mi*.
... Deploy the `*.yaml` file.

.. *With HELM*:
... Change the value of *limit_memory* to *4096Mi* in "values.yaml" file.

.. *With script*:
... Deploy the Defender using the install script.
... Run `kubectl edit ds twistlock-defender-ds -n twistlock` and change the value under *resources > limits > memory* to *4096Mi*.
... *Save* the file to restart the Defenders with the increased memory limit.

==== Pod Security Policy
If Pod Security Policy is enabled in your cluster, you might get the following error when trying to create a Defender DaemonSet.

  Error creating: pods "twistlock-defender-ds-" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy ..Privileged containers are not allowed

If you get this error, then you must create a PodSecurityPolicy for the Defender and the necessary ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding for the twistlock namespace.
You can use the following Pod Security Policy, ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding:
