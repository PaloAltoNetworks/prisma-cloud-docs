== Deploy App-Embedded Defender in Azure Container Instance (ACI)

toc::[]

Deploy an App-Embedded Defender in ACI to provide runtime protection to App-Embedded applications installed in ACI.
The App-Embedded Defender enforces runtime policy on the application entrypoint and any child processes created by this entrypoint.
To learn when to use App-Embedded Defenders, see xref:../defender_types.adoc[Defender types].

To learn more about App-Embedded Defender's capabilities, see:

[#sys-reqs]
=== System Requirements

* ACI supports Linux containers
* App-Embedded Defender image is supported on Linux (x86) architecture
* Any Docker image with Prisma Cloud App-Embedded Defender binary.
* Azure Container Registry (ACR) (recommended)

[#app-embedded-prisma]
=== Configure App-Embedded Defender in Prisma Console UI

include::fragments/configure-app-embedded-defender-in-prisma.adoc[leveloffset=0]

*Prerequisites*

* You can connect to Azure Container Registry(ACR) or any other registry used to pull your images.
* The container where you are embedding App-Embedded Defender can reach Console's port 8084 over the network.
* You have the Dockerfile for your image if you choose the *Deployment type* as Dockerfile.

[#defender-dockerfile]
[.task]
==== Embed App-Embedded Defender with Dockerfile

Upload your Dockerfile and Prisma Cloud creates a new Dockerfile with App-Embedded Defender parameters and the Defender binary file.

[.procedure]
include::fragments/embed-app-embedded-defender-with-dockerfile.adoc[leveloffet=0]
. Rebuild the image and embed the Defender in ACI.

[#defender-in-aci]
[.task]
=== Embed App-Embedded Defender in Azure ACI

Prisma Cloud uses the updated Dockerfile to deploy the Defender in your containers running in ACI. 
Use the updated Dockerfile to build the image for App-Embedded Defender, push it to Azure Container Registry, and then run the container instance.

*Prerequisite*:

* Log in to Azure
* Create an Azure resource group
* Create an Azure ACI context
* You have an image of the Defender binary from the download App-Embedded zipped bundle from Prisma Cloud Console.
* You have the modified Dockerfile with App-Embedded Defender deployment configurations.

[.procedure]

. Log in to your Azure instances
  
  az login

. Copy the App-Embedded zipped bundle and unzip it to get the Dockerfile and App-Embedded Defender binary.

. Build the Dockerfile:
  
  docker build -t <Azure_Container_Registry>:<docker_image_name> <local_path_host_dockerfile>
+
If your Dockerfile is in the current directory, use *.* for <local_path_host-Dockerfile>

. Start an Azure container instance from this image:

.. Go to *Azure Portal > Azure Container Registry > Repositories*. Right-click on the App-Embedded image and select *Run Instance*.

.. Create a container instance and edit the following:

... Enter the *Container name* to be the same as the container image name in Azure.
... Select the *OS type* as Linux (as Prisma Cloud only supports Linux x86 App-Embedded Defenders).
... Select *Public IP address* if you need routable IPs to establish communication between Prisma Console and Defender installed in Azure.
... Enter the *Port* defined for the APP in Dockerfile.

.. Select *Create*.

. In Azure Container instances, verify that your application shows a *running* status.
+
This App-Embedded Defender running in ACI is now recognized in Prisma Console under *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders*.

You can view the xref:../../../runtime_defense/runtime_defense_app_embedded.adoc[App-Embedded runtime events] by app ID under *Monitor > Events > App-Embedded audits*, and view the xref:../../../runtime_defense/incident_explorer.adoc[App-Embedded incidents] under *Monitor > Runtime > Incident Explorer*.

You can also xref:../../../waas/deploy_waas/deployment_app_embedded.adoc[deploy WAAS for Containers Protected By App-Embedded Defender], create a WAAS rule policy, add an app, enable protections, run WAAS sanity tests, and monitor the events under *Monitor > Events > WAAS for App-Embedded*.
