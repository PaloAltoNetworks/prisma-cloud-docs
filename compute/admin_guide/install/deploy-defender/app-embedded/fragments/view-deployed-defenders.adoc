By default, Prisma Cloud removes disconnected App-Embedded Defenders from the list after an hour.
As part of the cleanup process, data collected by the disconnected Defender is also removed from *Monitor > Runtime > App-Embedded observations*.

[NOTE]
====
There is an advanced settings dialog under *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders*, which lets you configure how long Prisma Cloud should wait before cleaning up disconnected Defenders.
This setting doesn't apply to App-Embedded Defenders.
Disconnected App-Embedded Defenders are always removed after one hour.
