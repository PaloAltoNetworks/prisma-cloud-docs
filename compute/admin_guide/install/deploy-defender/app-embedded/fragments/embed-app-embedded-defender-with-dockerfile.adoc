. In Deployment method, select *Single Defender*.

. Select the Defender type as *Container Defender - App-Embedded*.

. Select the DNS name configured in *Manage > Defenders > Names (SAN)* or public IP address that Defender will use to connect to Prisma Console.

. *Enable file system runtime protection* to allow the sensors to monitor file system events regardless of how your runtime policy is configured, and could impact the underlying workload's performance.

. Select Deployment type as *Dockerfile*.
.. In *App ID*, enter a unique identifier for the App-Embedded Defender.
All vulnerability, compliance, and runtime findings for the container will be aggregated under this App ID. In Console, the App ID is presented as the image name. Be sure to specify an App ID that lets you easily trace findings back to the image.
.. In *Data folder*, enter the path that the Defender will use to write files and store information.
.. *Dockerfile*: Upload the Dockerfile for your container image.
Set up the task's entrypoint in the Dockerfile. The embed process modifies the container's entrypoint to run the App-Embedded Defender first, which in turn starts the original entrypoint process. The Defender starts defending the app from the entrypoint and the thread/child process created by this entrypoint.

. *Download* the App-embedded bundle that contains the Dockerfile with Defender deployment configurations appended to your Dockerfile and the App-Embedded Defender binary file.
