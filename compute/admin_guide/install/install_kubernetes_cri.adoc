Kubernetes lets you set up a cluster with the container runtime of your choice.
Prisma Cloud supports Docker Engine, CRI-O, and cri-containerd.

=== Deploying Console

Irrespective of your cluster's underlying container runtime, you can install Console using the xref:install_kubernetes.adoc#install_console[standard install procedure].
Console doesn't interface with other containers, so it doesn't need to know which container runtime interface is being used.

=== Deploying Defender DaemonSets

When generating the YAML file to deploy the Defender DaemonSet, a toggle lets you select your runtime environment.
Since Defenders need to have a view of other containers, this option is necessary to guide the communication.
By default the toggle is off Prisma Cloud uses Docker Engine.
When the toggle is on, Prisma Cloud generates the propper _yaml_ for the CRI Kubernetes environment.

NOTE: If you use _containerd_ on GKE, and you install Defender without the CRI switch, everything will appear to work properly, but you'll have no images or container scan reports in *Monitor > Vulnerability* and *Monitor > Compliance pages* and you'll have no runtime models in *Monitor > Runtime*.
This happens because the Google Container Optimized Operating system (GCOOS) nodes have Docker Engine installed, but Kubernetes doesn't use it.
Defender thinks everything is OK because all of the integrations succeed, but the underlying runtime is actually different.

If you're deploying Defender DaemonSets with twistcli, use the *--cri* option to use to specify the runtime interface.
By default (no flag), twistcli generates a configuration that uses Docker Engine.
With the *--cri* flag, twistcli generates a configuration that uses CRI.

[source,bash]
----
$ <PLATFORM>/twistcli defender export kubernetes \
  --cri
  --address https://yourconsole.example.com:8083 \
  --user <ADMIN_USER> \
  --cluster-address yourconsole.example.com

When generating YAML from Console or twistcli, there is a simple change to the _yaml_ file as seen below.

In this abbreviated version DEFENDER_TYPE:daemonset will use the Docker interface.
