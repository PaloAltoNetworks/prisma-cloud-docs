== System Requirements

Before installing Prisma Cloud, verify that your environment meets the minimum requirements.

For information about when Prisma Cloud adds and drops support for third party software, see our xref:../welcome/support_lifecycle.adoc#third-party-software[support lifecycle] page.

=== Hardware

Prisma Cloud supports *x86_64* and *ARM64* architectures. 
Ensure that your systems meet the following hardware requirements.

ifdef::compute_edition[]

==== Prisma Cloud Console Resource Requirements on x86_64

The Prisma Cloud Console supports running on x86_64 systems.
Ensure your system meets the following requirements.

* For up to 1,000 Defenders connected:
** 4 vCPUs
** 8GB of RAM
** 100GB of persistent storage

* For 1,001 - 10,000 Defenders connected
** 8 vCPUs
** 30GB of RAM
** 500GB SSD of persistent storage

* More than 10,000 Defenders connected:
** At least 8 vCPUs
** At least 30GB of RAM
** At least 500GB SSD of persistent storage
** 4 vCPUS and 10GB of RAM for every additional 5,000 Defenders
For example, 20,000 connected Defenders require a total of 16 vCPUs, 50GB of RAM and 500GB SSD of persistent storage.

The Prisma Cloud Console uses `cgroups` to cap resource usage.
When more than 1,000 Defenders are connected, you should disable this cap using the `DISABLE_CONSOLE_CGROUP_LIMITS` flag in the `twistlock.cfg` configuration file.

endif::compute_edition[]

==== Defender Resource Requirements

Each Defender requires 256MB of RAM and 8GB of host storage.

The Defender uses `cgroups` to cap resource usage at 512MB of RAM and 900 CPU shares where a typical load is ~1-5% CPU and 30-70MB RAM.

The Defender stores its data in the `/var` folder.
When allocating disk space for Defender, ensure the required space is available in the `/var` folder.
Defenders are designed to be portable containers that collect data.
Any data that must be persisted is sent to the Prisma Cloud Console for storage.
Defenders don't require persistent storage.
If you deploy persistent storage for Defenders, it can corrupt Defender files.

If Defenders provide registry scanning they require the following resources:

* Defenders providing registry scanning--
* 2GB of RAM
* 20GB of storage
* 2 CPU cores
Defenders that are part of CI integrations (Jenkins, twistcli) require storage space depending on the size of the scanned images.
The required disk space is 1.5 times the size of the largest image to be scanned, per executor.
For example, if you have a Jenkins instance with two executors, and your largest container image is 500MB, then you need at least 1.5GB of storage space: `500MB x 1.5 x 2`

=== Virtual Machines (VMs)

Prisma Cloud has been tested on the following hypervisors:

* VMware for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Multicloud (TKGM)
* VMware for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI)

=== Cloud Platforms

Prisma Cloud can run on nearly any cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform.

Prisma Cloud has been tested on the following services:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform
* IBM Cloud
* Microsoft Azure
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

=== ARM Architecture Requirements

The following setups support Prisma Cloud on ARM64 architecture:

* Cloud provider
** *AWS* Graviton2 processors
** *GCP* GKE on ARM using the https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#t2a_machines[Tau T2A machine series]
* Supported Defenders:
    ** Orchestrator Defenders on AWS and GCP
    ** Host Defenders including auto-defend on AWS
* The `twistcli` is supported on Linux ARM64 instances.

Learn more in the <<arm64-os,Supported Operating Systems on ARM64>> and <<arm64-orchestrators,Supported Orchestrators on ARM64>> sections.

The Prisma Cloud Console doesn't support running on ARM64 systems.

ifdef::compute_edition[]

=== File Systems

When deploying Prisma Cloud Console to AWS using the EFS file system, you must meet the following minimum performance requirements:

* *Performance mode:* General purpose
* *Throughput mode:* Provisioned.
Provision 0.1 MiB/s per deployed Defender.
For example, if you plan to deploy 10 Defenders, provision 1 MiB/s of throughput.

* _/dev/log_ -- Required for writing to syslog.

[#docker_support]
=== Docker Engine

Prisma Cloud supports only the versions of the Docker Engine supported by Docker itself. Prisma Cloud supports only the following official mainstream Docker releases and later versions.

// Note: Starting with 18.09, Docker Engine CE and EE versions will be aligned, where EE is a superset of CE.
// They will ship concurrently with the same patch version based on the same code base.
// See https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/

* Community Edition (CE): 
** 18.06.1
** 20.10.7
** 20.10.13

* Enterprise Edition (EE):

=== Istio

Prisma Cloud supports Istio 1.13.4.

=== Jenkins

Prisma Cloud supports Jenkins 2.235.1, 2.319.1, and the 2.319.2 container version.

The Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin supports Jenkins LTS releases greater than 2.319.1.
For any given release of Prisma Cloud, the plugin supports those Jenkins LTS releases supported by the Jenkins project at the time of the Prisma Cloud release.

The Jenkins plugin is not supported on ARM64 architecture.

=== Image Base Layers

Prisma Cloud can protect containers built on nearly any base layer operating system.
Comprehensive Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data is provided for the following base layers for all versions except EOL versions:

* Alpine
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/amazon_linux_container_image.html[Amazon Linux container image]
* Amazon Linux 2
* BusyBox
* CentOS
* Debian
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* SUSE 
* Ubuntu (LTS releases only)
* Windows Server

If a CVE doesn't have an architecture identifier, the CVE is related to all architectures.

[#serverless_runtimes]
=== Serverless Runtimes

Prisma Cloud can protect AWS Lambda functions at runtime.  Prisma Cloud supports the following runtimes:

==== Serverless Runtimes Using Lambda Layers

* Node.js 12.x, 14.x
* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
* Ruby 2.7

==== Serverless Runtimes Using Manually Embedded Defenders in AWS

* C# (.NET Core 3.1)
* Java 8, 11
* Node.js 12.x, 14.x
* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
* Ruby 2.7

Prisma Cloud can also scan serverless functions for vulnerabilities and compliance benchmarks. 
Prisma Cloud supports the following runtimes for vulnerability and compliance scans in AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions:

==== Serverless Vulnerability and Compliance Scanning

* Node.js 12.x, 14.x
* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
* Ruby 2.7

==== Serverless WAAS Functions

* Java 11
* Node.js 12.x, 14.x
* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
* Ruby 2.7

==== Serverless Runtimes Using Manually Embedded Defenders in Azure

* C# 3 (.NET Core 3.1)
* C# 5 (.NET Core 4.0)
* C# 6 (.NET Core 4.0)

=== Go

Prisma Cloud can detect vulnerabilities in Go executables for Go versions 1.13 and greater.

=== Shells

For Linux, Prisma Cloud depends on the Bash shell.
For Windows, Prisma Cloud depends on PowerShell.

The shell environment variable `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` should be set to `0` or unset before running any commands that interact with the Prisma Cloud cloud registry, such as Defender installs or upgrades.

=== Browsers

Prisma Cloud supports the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Edge.

For Microsoft Edge, only the new Chromium-based version (80.0.361 and later) is supported.

=== Cortex XDR 

Prisma Cloud Defenders can work alongside Cortex XDR agents. 
Currently, users need to manually add exceptions in Console for both agents to work together.
In a future release, there will be out-of-the-box support for co-existence.
Users can disable the Defender runtime defense when a Cortex XDR agent is present.

To allow for both the solutions to co-exist:

. Add the Cortex agent as a trustable executable.
For more information, see to xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#create-a-list-of-trusted-executables[Creating a trusted exeuctable].

. Suppress runtime alerts from the Cortex agent by adding custom runtime rules that allow the Cortex agent process and file path.
