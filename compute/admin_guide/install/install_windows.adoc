== Windows

Prisma Cloud can secure Windows containers running on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019 hosts.
A single instance of Prisma Cloud Console can simultaneously protect both Windows and Linux containers on both Windows and Linux hosts.
Prisma Cloud’s Intelligence Stream includes vulnerability data from Microsoft, so as new CVEs are reported, Prisma Cloud can detect them in your Windows images.

The architecture for Defender on Windows is different than Defender on Linux.
The Defender runs as a Docker container on Linux, and as a Windows service on Windows.
On Linux, it is implemented as runtime protection in the userspace, and on Windows it is implemented using Windows drivers.
This is because there is no concept of capabilities in Windows Docker containers like there is on Linux.
Defender on Windows runs as service so it can acquire the permissions it needs to secure the containers on your host.
When you deploy the Defender, it appears as a service.
The Defender type "Container Defender - Windows" means that Defender is capable of securing your containers, not that it's deployed as a container.

To deploy Defender on Windows, you’ll copy a PowerShell script from the Prisma Cloud Console and run it on the host where you want to install Defender.

Windows Host Defenders support xref:../compliance/windows.adoc[Windows compliance checks for hosts].
Only Windows Container Defenders for Windows based containers support xref:../compliance/custom_compliance_checks.adoc[custom compliance checks].

As a quick review, Prisma Cloud runtime defense builds a model of allowed activity for each container image during a learning period.
After the learning period has completed, any violation of the model triggers an action as defined by your policy (alert, prevent, block).

As Prisma Cloud builds the model, any interactive tasks that are run are logged.
These interactive tasks can be viewed in each model's history tab.
On Windows, Prisma Cloud can't currently detect when interactive tasks are run with the _docker exec_ command, although Prisma Cloud does correctly record interactive tasks run from a shell inside a container with the _docker run -it <IMAGE> sh_ command.
No matter how the interactive task is run, however, the model will correctly allow a process if it's in learning mode, and it will take action if the model is violated when in enforcement mode.

Windows Container Defenders scan both the containers and the hosts where they run for vulnerabilities.

=== Deploying Defender on Windows with Docker runtime

ifdef::compute_edition[]
Prisma Cloud Console must be first installed on a Linux host.
Prisma Cloud Defenders are then installed on each Windows host you want to protect.
For more information about installing Console, see xref:../install/getting_started.adoc[Getting Started].
The xref:../install/install_onebox.adoc[Onebox] install is the fastest way to get Console running on a stand-alone Linux machine.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
Install Prsima Cloud Defenders on every Windows host you want to protect.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

Defenders are deployed with with a PowerShell 64-bit script, _defender.ps1_, which downloads the necessary files from Console.
Defender is registered as a Windows service.

NOTE: Run the Prisma Cloud Defender deployment PowerShell script from a Windows PowerShell 64-bit shell.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud Windows container defenders are tested and supported for GKE Windows server containers.

After the install is completed, Prisma Cloud files can be found in the following locations:

* _C:\Program Files\Prisma Cloud\_
* _C:\ProgramData\Prisma Cloud\_

*Prerequisites:*

* Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019.
Prisma Cloud is not supported on Windows 10 or Hyper-V.
* Docker for Windows (1.12.2-cs2-ws-beta) or higher.
For more information about installing Docker on Windows, see 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/quick-start-windows-server[Windows Containers on Windows Server].

[.procedure]
. Log into Console

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*

. Select *Single Defender*

. In *Choose the Defender type*, select *Container Defender - Windows*

. Copy the curl script and run it on your host to install Windows Defender
+
NOTE: If you install Windows locally on your laptop, the 'netsh' commands are not needed.
They are only applicable to the GCE environment.

[.task]
=== Deploy Container Defender on Windows with containerd runtime

You can also deploy the Windows container defender to protect your containers running on *Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)* Windows nodes with *containerd* runtime.
By installing the Defender you will be able to view the running containers and images on the Radar and leverage Prisma Cloud Runtime Defense capabilities on the running containers.

*Prerequisites:*

* Make sure you are using Windows Server 2019 with containerd runtime.
* The nodes are part of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Windows Server node pool
* Learn more about https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/windows-container-cli#optional-using-containerd-with-windows-server-node-pools-preview[Using containerd with Windows Server node pools (preview)]

[.procedure]
. Log into Console.

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*

. Select *Single Defender*

. In *Choose the Defender type*, select *Container Defender - Windows*

. Set the option for *Node is using containerd, not Docker* to *On*

. Copy the curl script and run it on your host to install Windows Defender
+
NOTE: Twistcli can't be used on Windows machines running containerd.


=== Registry scanning

To scan Windows images in your registry, you must install at least one Windows Defender.
Prisma Cloud automatically distributes the scan job across available Defenders.
To scan registries that hold both Windows and Linux images, install at least one Linux Defender and one Windows Defender in your environment.

Registry scan settings can include a mix of both Defenders running on hosts with Docker Engine and containerd as scanners.


[.task]
=== Uninstalling Defender

You can uninstall Defender directly from the Console UI.

You can also manually uninstall Defender from the command line by running:

  C:\Program Files\Twistlock\scripts\defender.ps1 -uninstall

NOTE: Since Defender runs as a Windows service, decommissioning it will stop the service.
Some remnant files might need to be deleted manually.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.
+
This page shows a list of Defenders deployed in your environment and connected to Console.

. Click the *Decommission* button.


=== Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations:

* Windows Defenders support xref:../compliance/windows.adoc[Windows compliance checks for hosts] and xref:../compliance/custom_compliance_checks.adoc[custom compliance checks] only.
Image and container compliance checks aren't supported.
* Windows requires the host OS version to match the container OS version.
If you want to run a container based on a newer Windows build, make sure you have an equivalent host build.
Otherwise, you can use Hyper-V isolation to run older containers on new host builds.
