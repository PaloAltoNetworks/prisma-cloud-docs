== Serverless Defender

toc::[]

Serverless Defender protects serverless functions at runtime.
It monitors your functions to ensure they execute as designed.

Per-function policies let you control:

* Process activity.
Enables verification of launched subprocesses against policy.

* Network connections.
Enables verification of inbound and outbound connections, and permits outbound connections to explicitly allowed domains.

* File system activity.
Controls which parts of the file system functions can access.

Prisma Cloud supports AWS Lambda functions (Linux) and Azure Functions (Windows only).

See xref:../system_requirements.adoc#serverless_runtimes[system requirements] for the runtimes and architectures that are supported for Serverless Defenders.

The following runtimes are supported for AWS Lambda:

* C# (.NET Core) 3.1
* Java 8, 11
* Node.js 12.x, 14.x
* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
* Ruby 2.7

Serverless Defenders are not supported on ARM64 architecture.

The following runtimes are supported for Azure Functions (Windows and 64 bit only):

* v3 - C# (.NET Core) 3.1
* v4 - C# (.NET Core) 6.0

// To be fixed.

[#secure-serverless-functions]
=== Securing serverless functions

To secure a serverless function, embed the Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender into it.
The steps are:

. (Optional) If you are not using a deployment framework like SAM or Serverless Framework, download a ZIP file that contains your function source code and dependencies.

. Embed the Serverless Defender into the function.

. Deploy the new function or upload the updated ZIP file to the cloud provider.

. Define a serverless protection runtime policy.

. Define a serverless WAAS policy.


[.task]
[#aws-lambda-download-function-zip-file]
=== AWS Lambda - (Optional) Download your function as a ZIP file

Download your function's source code from AWS as a ZIP file.

[.procedure]
. From Lambda's code editor, click *Actions > Export function*.

. Click *Download deployment package*.
+
Your function is downloaded to your host as a ZIP file.

. Create a working directory, and unpack the ZIP file there.
+
In the next step, you'll download the Serverless Defender files to this working directory.


[.task]
[#aws-lamda-embed-serverless-defender-into-c-function]
=== AWS Lambda - Embed Serverless Defender into C# functions

In your function code, import the Serverless Defender library and create a new protected handler that wraps the original handler.
The protected handler will be called by AWS when your function is invoked.
Update the project configuration file to add Prisma Cloud dependencies and package references.

Prisma Cloud supports .NET Core 3.1, 6.0.

[.procedure]
. Open Compute Console, and go to *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders > Manual deploy > Single Defender*.

. In *Choose Defender type*, select *Serverless Defender - AWS*.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
. Choose the DNS name or IP address Serverless Defender uses to connect to Console.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
. The DNS name Serverless Defender uses to connect to your Compute Console is prepopulated for you.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

. In *Runtime*, select *C#*.

. Download the Serverless Defender package to your workstation.

. Unzip the Serverless Defender bundle into your working directory.

. Embed the serverless Defender into the function by importing the Prisma Cloud library and wrapping the function's handler.
+
Function input and output can be a struct or a stream.
Functions can be synchronous or asynchronous.
The context parameter is optional in .NET, so it can be omitted.

[.task]
=== AWS Lambda - Embed Serverless Defender into Java functions

To embed Serverless Defender, import the Twistlock package and update your code to start Serverless Defender as soon as the function is invoked.
Prisma Cloud supports both Maven and Gradle projects.
You'll also need to update your project metadata to include Serverless Defender dependencies.

Prisma Cloud supports https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-handler-using-predefined-interfaces.html[both predefined interfaces] in the AWS Lambda Java core library: RequestStreamHandler (where input must be serialized JSON) and RequestHandler.

AWS lets you specify handlers as functions or classes.
In both cases, Twistlock.Handler(), the entry point to Serverless Defender, assumes the entry point to your code is named handleRequest.
After embedding Serverless Defender, update the name of the handler registered with AWS to be the wrapper method that calls Twistlock.Handler() (for example, protectedHandler).

Prisma Cloud supports both service struct and stream input (serialized struct).
Even though the Context parameter is optional for unprotected functions, it's manadatory when embedding Serverless Defender.

Prisma Cloud supports Java 8 and Java 11.

[.procedure]
. Open Compute Console, and go to *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders > Manual Deploy > Single Defender*.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
. Choose the DNS name or IP address Serverless Defender uses to connect to Console.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
. The DNS name Serverless Defender uses to connect to your Compute Console is prepopulated for you.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

. In *Defender type*, select *Serverless Defender - AWS*.

. Select the name that Defender will use to connect to this Console.

. In *Runtime*, select *Java*.

. In *Package*, select *Maven* or *Gradle*.
+
The steps for embedding Serverless Defender differ depending on the build tool.

. Download the Serverless Defender package to your workstation.

. Unzip the Serverless Defender bundle into your working directory.

.. Enter the package details and artifact id in the `defender-<version>.pom` file:

  <project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.twistlock.serverless</groupId>
    <artifactId>defender</artifactId>

[#define-policy]
[.task]
=== Defining your runtime protection policy

By default, Prisma Cloud ships with an empty serverless runtime policy.
An empty policy disables runtime defense entirely.

You can enable runtime defense by creating a rule.
By default, new rules:

* Apply to all functions (`{asterisk}`), but you can target them to specific functions by function name.
* Block all processes from running except the main process.
This protects against command injection attacks.

When functions are invoked, they connect to Compute Console and retrieve the latest policy.
To ensure that functions start executing at time=0 with your custom policy, predefine the policy.
Predefined policy is embedded into your function along with the Serverless Defender by way of the `TW_POLICY` environment variable.

// To minimize the impact on start latency, the customer's business logic is allowed to asynchronously start executing while the policy
// is downloaded in the background. The sequence of events is:
//
// 1. Start the Serverless Defender
// 2. Download policy, if necessary
// 3. Run customer's handler
//
// Steps 2 and 3 are asynchronous (3 can start before 2 finishes). For this reason, it's important to define policy before embedding
// the `TW_POLICY` env var into the function.
//
// For more info: see the discussion in https://github.com/twistlock/docs/pull/1227/files

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Defend > Runtime > Serverless Policy*.

. Click *Add rule*.

. In the *General* tab, enter a rule name.

. (Optional) Target the rule to specific functions.
+
Use collections to scope functions by name or region (label).
xref:../../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc[Pattern matching] is supported.
For Azure Funtions only, you can additionally scope rules by account ID.
