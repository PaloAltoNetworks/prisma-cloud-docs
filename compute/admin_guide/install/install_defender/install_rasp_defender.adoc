== App-Embedded Defender

App-Embedded Defenders monitor your containers to ensure they execute as designed, protecting them from suspicious processes and outbound network connections.
See the article on xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc[Defender types] to learn when to deploy App-Embedded Defenders.

App-Embedded Defender policies let you define:

* Process allow or deny lists.
Enables verification of launched processes against policy.

* Outgoing connections allow or deny lists.
Enables verification of domain name resolution against policy for outgoing network connections.

Besides runtime policy, you can also configure the xref:../../waas/waas.adoc[WAAS] application firewall to protect front-end containers.

App-Embedded Defender is the only supported option for securing containers at runtime when you're using nested virtualization
Nested virtualization is also known as *Docker-in-Docker*.
Docker-in-Docker is a setup where you have a Docker container that itself has Docker installed, and from within the container you use Docker to pull images, build images, run containers, and so on.
To secure the containers inside a container, use App-Embedded Defender.


=== Securing containers

To secure a container, embed the App-Embedded Defender into it.
You can embed App-Embedded Defenders with the Console UI, twistcli, or Prisma Cloud API.
App-Embedded Defender has been tested on Azure Container Instances, Google Cloud Run, and Fargate on EKS.

The steps are:

. Define your policy in Prisma Cloud Console.
. Embed the App-Embedded Defender into the container.
. Start the service.

The embed process takes a Dockerfile as input, and returns a ZIP file with an augmented Dockerfile and App-Embedded Defender binaries.
Rebuild your container image with the new Dockerfile to complete the embedding process.
The embed process modifies the container's entrypoint to run App-Embedded Defender, which in turn starts the original entrypoint program.

When embedding App-Embedded Defender, specify a unique identifier for your container image.
This gives you a way to uniquely identify the App-Embedded Defender in the environment.

When securing your apps with runtime rules, target rules to apps using the App ID.
(Because the App-Embedded Defender runs inside the container, it can't reliably get information such as image and container names.)

=== Embed App-Embedded Defender

Embed App-Embedded Defender into a container image from Console's UI.

*Prerequisites:*

* The container where you're embedding App-Embedded Defender can reach Console's port 8084 over the network.
* You have the Dockerfile for your image.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*.

. In the second drop-down list, select the App-Embedded Defender type.

. In *Deployment Type*, select *Dockerfile*.

. In *Application ID*, enter a unique identifier for the App-Embedded Defender.

. In *Dockerfile*, click *Choose File*, and upload the Dockerfile for your container image.

. Click *Create Embedded ZIP*.
+
A file named _app_embedded_embed_help.zip_ is created and downloaded to your system.

. Unpack app_embedded_embed_help.zip.

  $ mkdir tmp
  $ unzip app_embedded_embed_help.zip -d tmp/

. Build the modified Docker image.

  $ cd tmp/
  $ docker build .

. Tag and push the updated image to your repository.


[.task]
=== Embed App-Embedded Defender manually

Embed App-Embedded Defender into a container image manually.
Modify your Dockerfile with the supplied information, download the App-Embedded Defender binaries into the image's build context, then rebuild the image.

*Prerequisites:*

* The container where you're embedding App-Embedded Defender can reach Console over the network on port 8084.
* The host where you're updating your container image with App-Embedded Defender can reach Console over the network on port 8083.
* You have the Dockerfile for your image.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*.

. In the first drop-down list, select the DNS name or IP address that App-Embedded Defender uses to connect to Console.

. In the second drop-down list, select the App-Embedded Defender type.

. In *Deployment Type*, select *Manual*.
A set of instructions for embedding App-Embedded Defender into your images is provided.

.. Download the App-Embedded Defender binaries into the directory that holds your image's build context.

  $ curl -u <username> https://<CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/images/twistl<CONSOLE>

.. Retrieve the keys App-Embedded Defender needs to connect to Console.
This value will be set as the value for the INSTALL_BUNDLE environment variable in your Dockerfile.

  $ curl -k \
  -u <CONSOLE_ADMIN_USER>
  https://<CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/defenders/install-bundle
+
The curl command returns a JSON object:

  {"bundle":"eyJj..."}
+
Set INSTALL_BUNDLE to the value for bundle.
For example:
+
  ENV INSTALL_BUNDLE="eyJj..."

.. Open your Dockerfile for editing.

.. In the Dockerfile, add the App-Embedded Defender to the image.

  ADD twistlock_defender_app_embedded.tar.gz /twistlock/

.. In the Dockerfile, add the specified environment variables.
Replace the values for <DEFENDER_APP_ID>, <CONSOLE>, and <INSTALL_BUNDLE>.

  ENV DEFENDER_TYPE="appEmbedded"
  ENV DEFENDER_APP_ID="my-app"
  ENV WS_ADDRESS="wss://<CONSOLE>:8084"
  ENV DATA_FOLDER="/twistlock/"
  ENV INSTALL_BUNDLE=""

.. Modify the run or entrypoint command such that the command that starts your app is an argument to App-Embedded Defender.
For example, to start the hello program under the control of App-Embedded Defender, specify the following entrypoint.

  ENTRYPOINT ["/twistlock/defender", "app-embedded", "hello"]

. Rebuild your image.

  $ docker build .

. Tag and push the updated image to your repository.

=== Embed App-Embedded Defender with twistcli

Prisma Cloud supports automation for embedding App-Embedded Defender into container images with either twistcli or the API.
This section shows you how to use twistcli.
To learn how to use the API, see the API docs.

*Prerequisites:*

* The container where you're embedding App-Embedded Defender can reach Console's port 8084 over the network.
* You have the Dockerfile for your image.

[.procedure]
. Download twistcli.

.. Log into Console, and go to *Manage > System > Utilities*.

.. Download the twistcli binary for your platform.

. Generate the artifacts for an updated container with twistcli.
A file named _app_embedded_embed_help.zip_ is created.

  $ ./twistcli app-embedded embed \
    --user <USER>
    --address "https://<CONSOLE>:8083" \
    --console-host <CONSOLE> \
    --app-id "<DEFENDER-ID>"  \
    --data-folder "<DATA-FOLDER>"  \
    Dockerfile
+
<USER>::
Name of a Prisma Cloud user with a minimum xref:../../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] of Defender Manager.

<CONSOLE>::
DNS name or IP address for Console.

<APP-ID>::
Unique identifier for the App-Embedded Defender.
For example, _my-app_.

<DATA-FOLDER>::
Readable and writable directory in the container's filesystem.
For example, _/twistlock/_.

. Unpack _app_embedded_embed_help.zip_.

  $ mkdir tmp
  $ unzip app_embedded_embed_help.zip -d tmp/

. Build the updated image.

  $ cd tmp/
  $ docker build .

. Tag and push the updated image to your repository.
