== Prometheus

Prometheus is a monitoring platform that collects metrics from targets by scraping their published endpoints.
Prisma Cloud can be configured to be a Prometheus target.

You can use Prometheus to monitor time series data across your environment and show high-level, dashboard-like, stats to visualize trends and changes.
Prisma Cloud's instrumentation lets you track metrics such as the total number of connected Defenders and the total number of container images in your environment being protected by Defender.


=== Metrics

Metrics are a core Prometheus concept.
Instrumented systems expose metrics.
Prometheus stores the metrics in its time-series database, and makes them easily available to query to understand how systems behave over time.

Prisma Cloud has two types of metrics:

* Counters:
Single monotonically increasing values.
A counter's value can only increase or be reset to zero.

* Gauges:
Single numerical values that can arbitrarily go up or down.


[.section]
==== Prisma Cloud metrics

All Prisma Cloud metrics are listed in the following table.
Vulnerability and compliance metrics are updated every 24 hours.
The rest of the metrics are updated every 10 minutes.

Note that *_vulnerabilities and *_compliance metrics report how many entities (images, containers, hosts, etc) are at risk by the highest severity issue that impacts them.
In other words, images_critical_vulnerabilities is not a total count of critical vulnerabilities in the images in your environment.
Rather, it is a total count of images where the highest severity CVE is critical.
For a thorough explanation of how this type of metric is used, see xref:../vulnerability_management/vuln_explorer.adoc#roll-ups[Vulnerability Explorer].

=== Integrating Prisma Cloud with Prometheus

The Prometheus server scrapes endpoints at configurable time intervals.
Prisma Cloud refreshes vulnerability and compliance data every 24 hours.
All other data is refreshed every 10 minutes.
Regardless of the value you set for the Prometheus scrape interval, new Prisma Cloud data is only available at our refresh rates.

This procedure shows you how to enable Prisma Cloud's Prometheus integration and spin up a Prometheus server running in a container.
If you already have a Prometheus server in your environment, all you need is the Prisma Cloud scrape configuration.

[.procedure]
. Enable Prisma Cloud's Prometheus instrumentation.

.. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Go to *Manage > Alerts > Logging*.

.. Set *Prometheus instrumentation* to *Enabled*.

. Prepare a scrape configuration file for the Prometheus server.

.. Create a new file named _prometheus.yml_, and open it for editing.

.. Enter the following configuration, where:
+
* CONSOLE_ADDRESS is the DNS name or IP address for Prisma Cloud Console.
* USER is a Prisma Cloud user, with the minimum role of Auditor.
* PASS is the user's password.
+
----
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

# Prisma Cloud scrape configuration.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'twistlock'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['CONSOLE_ADDRESS:8083']
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    basic_auth:
      username: 'USER'
      password: 'PASS'
----

. Start the Prometheus server with the scrape configuration file.

 $ docker run \
   --rm \
   --network=host \
   -p 9090:9090 \
   -v /PATH_TO_YML/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
   prom/prometheus

. Validate that the Prisma Cloud integration is properly set up
In a new browser window, go to \http://<PROMETHEUS_HOST>:9090/targets.

NOTE: For testing, restart Console to get results immediately instead of waiting for the first 10 minute window to elapse.

=== Using Prometheus with Projects

If you want to use Prometheus with xref:../deployment_patterns/projects.adoc[projects], modify the scrape configuration file with an additional job for each Prisma Cloud Console.

If you are using tenant projects, enable Prometheus instrumentation in both the Central and Supervisor Consoles.

The following listing shows an example configuration that scrapes two Consoles:

* Central Console.
* A supervisor Console for a tenant project.

----
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

# Prisma Cloud scrape configuration.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'Central Console'
    static_configs:
    - targets: [CONSOLE_ADDRESS:8083]
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    basic_auth:
      username: 'USER01'
      password: 'PASS01'
  - job_name: 'Tenant Console'
    static_configs:
    - targets: [CONSOLE_ADDRESS:8083]
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    scheme: http
    params:
      project: [TENANT_PROJECT_NAME]
    basic_auth:
      username: 'USER02'
      password: 'PASS02'
----

Where:

* CONSOLE_ADDRESS -- DNS name or IP address for your Central Console
* USER01 -- Prisma Cloud user with access to Central Console
* PASS01 -- USER01's password
* USER02 -- Prisma Cloud user with access to the tenant project
* PASS02 -- USER02's password
* TENANT_PROJECT_NAME -- name of the tenant project

NOTE: The value in job_name does not need to match anything else.
You can set it to anything.

=== Create a simple graph

Create a graph that shows the number of deployed Defenders.

[.procedure]
. Go to \http://<PROMETHEUS_HOST>:9090/graph

. Click *Add Graph*.

. In the drop-down list, select *twistlock_total_defenders*.

. Click *Execute*.
In the *Console* tab, you will see the value for total number of Defenders connected to Console.

. Open the *Graph* tab to see a visual representation of how the number of Defenders has changed over time.
