== Prometheus

Prometheus is a monitoring platform that scrapes the published endpoints of targets to collect their metrics.
You can configure Prisma Cloud to be a Prometheus target.

You can use Prometheus to monitor time series data across your environment and show high-level, dashboard-like, stats to visualize trends and changes.
Prisma Cloud's instrumentation lets you track metrics such as the total number of connected Defenders and the total number of container images in your environment that your Defenders protect.

=== Metrics

Metrics are a core Prometheus concept.
Instrumented systems expose metrics.
Prometheus stores the metrics in its time-series database, and makes them easily available to query to understand how systems behave over time.

Prisma Cloud has two types of metrics:

* Counters:
Single monotonically increasing values.
A counter's value can only increase or be reset to zero.

* Gauges:
Single numerical values that can arbitrarily go up or down.

==== Prisma Cloud metrics

All Prisma Cloud metrics are listed in the following table.
Vulnerability and compliance metrics are updated every 24 hours.
The rest of the metrics are updated every 10 minutes.

The *vulnerabilities* and *compliance* metrics report the number of many entities, for example images, containers, or hosts, that are at risk by the highest severity issue impacting them.
The *images_critical_vulnerabilities* is not the total count of critical vulnerabilities in the images in your environment.
It is the total count of images where the highest severity CVE is critical.
For a thorough explanation of this type of metric, see xref:../vulnerability_management/vuln_explorer.adoc#roll-ups[Vulnerability Explorer].

=== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Prometheus

The Prometheus server scrapes endpoints at configurable time intervals.
Regardless of the value you set for the Prometheus scrape interval, new Prisma Cloud data is only available at the following refresh rates.

* Vulnerability and compliance data is refreshed every 24 hours.
* All other data is refreshed every 10 minutes.

This procedure shows how to complete the following tasks.

. Enable the Prometheus integration.
. Configure the Prisma Cloud scrape.
. Start a Prometheus server running in a container.

If you already have a Prometheus server in your environment, you only need to enable the integration and configure the scrape.

[.procedure]
. Enable the Prometheus integration.

.. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Go to *Manage > Alerts > Logging*.

.. Set *Prometheus instrumentation* to *Enabled*.

. Prepare a scrape configuration file for the Prometheus server.

.. Create a new `prometheus.yml` file, and open it for editing.

.. Enter the following configuration fields.
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

# Prisma Cloud scrape configuration.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'twistlock'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['CONSOLE_ADDRESS:8083']
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    basic_auth:
      username: 'USER'
      password: 'PASS'
----
+
* Replace `CONSOLE_ADDRESS` with the DNS name or IP address for Prisma Cloud Console.
* Replace `USER` with a Prisma Cloud user, which has the minimum role of *Auditor*.
* Replace `PASS` with that Prisma Cloud user's password.

. Start the Prometheus server with the scrape configuration file.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run \
  --rm \
  --network=host \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v /PATH_TO_YML/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus
----

. Go to \http://<PROMETHEUS_HOST>:9090/targets to validate that the Prisma Cloud integration is properly set up.

[NOTE]
====
To get results immediately for testing, restart the prisma Cloud Console.
If you are using the PCEE, wait 10 minutes for the first refresh window to elapse.

=== Use Prometheus with Projects

If you want to use Prometheus with xref:../deployment_patterns/projects.adoc[projects], modify the scrape configuration file with an additional job for each Prisma Cloud Console.

If you are using tenant projects, enable Prometheus instrumentation in both the Central and Supervisor Consoles.

The following listing shows an example configuration that scrapes the following Prisma Cloud Consoles.

* A central Prisma Cloud Console.
* A supervisor Prisma Cloud Console for a tenant project.

[source,yaml]
----
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

# Prisma Cloud scrape configuration.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'Central Console'
    static_configs:
    - targets: [CONSOLE_ADDRESS:8083]
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    basic_auth:
      username: 'USER01'
      password: 'PASS01'
  - job_name: 'Tenant Console'
    static_configs:
    - targets: [CONSOLE_ADDRESS:8083]
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    scheme: http
    params:
      project: [TENANT_PROJECT_NAME]
    basic_auth:
      username: 'USER02'
      password: 'PASS02'
----

The configuration uses the following fields.

* `CONSOLE_ADDRESS` -- DNS name or IP address for your central Prisma Cloud Console
* `USER01` -- Prisma Cloud user with access to central Prisma Cloud Console
* `PASS01` -- `USER01`'s password
* `USER02` -- Prisma Cloud user with access to the tenant project
* `PASS02` -- `USER02`'s password
* `TENANT_PROJECT_NAME` -- name of the tenant project

[NOTE]
====
The value in job_name does not need to match anything else.
You can set it to anything.

=== Create a simple graph

Create a graph that shows the number of deployed Defenders.

[.procedure]
. Go to \http://<PROMETHEUS_HOST>:9090/graph

. Click *Add Graph*.

. In the drop-down list, select *twistlock_total_defenders*.

. Click *Execute*.
In the *Console* tab, you see the value for total number of Defenders connected to the Prisma Cloud Console.

. Open the *Graph* tab to see a visual representation of how the number of Defenders has changed over time.
