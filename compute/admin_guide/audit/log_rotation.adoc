== Log rotation

Both Console and Defender call _log-rotate_ every 30 minutes.
The options passed to log-rotate are described below.


[.section]
=== Defender

The default path for Defender's log file is _/var/lib/twistlock/log/defender.log_.

It is configured as follows:

* Truncate the original log file in place after creating a copy, instead of moving the old log file. (`copytruncate`)
* Have 10 backup files rotated. If rotation exceeds 10 files, the oldest rotated file is deleted. (`rotate 10`)
* Don't generate an error in case a log file doesn't exist. (`missingok`)
* Don't rotate the log in case it's empty.  (`notifempty`)
* Rotate the log only if its size is 100M or more. (`size 100M`)
* Compress the rotated logs. (`compress`)


[.section]
=== Console

The default path for Console's log file is _/var/lib/twistlock/log/console.log_.

It is configured as follows:

=== DB logs

We log CRITICAL/ERROR messages to enable critical DB diagnostics.

NOTE: This is automatically done by Prisma Cloud and is non-configurable.
