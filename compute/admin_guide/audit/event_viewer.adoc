== Event viewer

Prisma Cloud creates and stores audit event records (audits) for all major subsystems.
Audits can be reviewed in *Monitor > Events*, or they can be retrieved from the https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/api/twistlock_api.html[Prisma Cloud API].
If you have a centralized syslog collector, you can xref:../audit/logging.adoc[integrate Prisma Cloud] with your existing infrastructure by configuring Prisma Cloud to send all audit events to syslog in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424[RFC5424]-compliant format.

NOTE: When you're reviewing audits in a dialog, the list of audits isn't updated in real-time.
To retrieve all the latest data, close the dialog.
If the *Refresh* button is decorated with a red indicator, click it to refresh the view with the latest data, then reopen the dialog.

=== Access audits
Access to any container resource protected by Defender is logged and aggregated in Console.
You can also configure Prisma Cloud to xref:../audit/host_activity.adoc[record audits for sudo, SSH, and other events] that are executed on hosts protected by Defender.
This audit trail links access to system components to individual users.
Access events can be viewed in Console under *Monitor > Events*.

[.section]
=== Runtime audits
Prisma Cloud records an audit every time a runtime sensor (process, network, file system, and system call) detects activity that deviates from the sum of the predictive model plus any runtime rules you've defined.
For example, a file system audit event is emitted when Prisma Cloud detects malware in a container.
Runtime events for containers can be viewed in Console under *Monitor > Events*.
Runtime events for hosts can be viewed in Console under *Monitor > Events*.

[.section]
=== Firewall audits
Web Application and API Security (WAAS) is a layer 7 filtering engine that ensures only safe, clean traffic ever reaches your web app.
Audits are generated when WAAS detects an attack, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
WAAS audits can be viewed under *Monitor > Events*.

[.section]
=== Admin activity
All Prisma Cloud xref:../audit/audit_admin_activity.adoc[administrative activity] can viewed under *Manage > View Logs*.

Prisma Cloud limits viewing of audit trails to those with a job-related need.
To view audit events, you must log into Console.
Only users with Administrator, Operator, Defender Manager, or Auditor xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[roles] can view audit data in Console.
Similarly, only users with the above-mentioned roles can retrieve audit data from the Prisma Cloud API.
