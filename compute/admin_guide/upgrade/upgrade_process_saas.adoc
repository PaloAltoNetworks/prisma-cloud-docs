== Upgrade process

Palo Alto Networks manages and maintains your Prisma Cloud Console.

=== Console 

Palo Alto Networks periodically upgrades your Prisma Cloud Compute Console.
The changes for each release are always published in the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-release-notes/prisma-cloud-compute-release-information.html[Release Notes].
Ensure that you have read through all 'Breaking Changes' in release notes for each major release, for any action items from the users.

The currently installed version of Console is displayed in the bell menu.

=== Defender and Prisma Cloud components upgrade process

After the Console has been upgraded, check and upgrade any of the Defenders that have reached the end of their support lifecycle (Defenders are backward compatible for N-2 releases). The Defender release image is built from the UBI8-minimal base image and on upgrade it is a full container image upgrade, which means that the old Defender container is replaced with a new container.
Then, upgrade all other Prisma Cloud components, such as the Jenkins plugin.

The steps in the upgrade process are:

. Go to Manage > Defenders > Manage and filter the the *Status* column by *Upgrade Required* and upgrade all the listed defenders

. Validate that all deployed Defenders have been upgraded.

. To download the latest version of all other Prisma Cloud Compute components (such as the Jenkins plugin) either go to *Manage > System > Utilities* to download the latest version of these or directly pull from the API.

NOTE: An App-Embedded defender for Fargate can't upgrade. In case of an App-Embedded defender for Fargate, you need to redeploy a new task definition.
