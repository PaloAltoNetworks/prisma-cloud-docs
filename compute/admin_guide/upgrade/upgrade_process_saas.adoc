=== Console

Ensure that you have read through all 'Breaking Changes' in release notes for each major release, for any action items from the users.

=== Defender and Prisma Cloud components upgrade process

After the Console has been upgraded, check and upgrade any of the Defenders that have reached the end of their support lifecycle (Defenders are backward compatible for N-2 releases). 
Then, upgrade all other Prisma Cloud components, such as the Jenkins plugin.

The steps in the upgrade process are:

. Go to Manage > Defenders > Manage and filter the the *Status* column by *Upgrade Required* and upgrade all the listed defenders

. Validate that all deployed Defenders have been upgraded.

. To download the latest version of all other Prisma Cloud Compute components (such as the Jenkins plugin) either go to *Manage > System > Utilities* to download the latest version of these or directly pull from the API.
