Upgrade Prisma Cloud running on Amazon ECS.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
First upgrade Console.
Console will then automatically upgrade all deployed Defenders for you.
If you've disabled Defender auto-upgrade or if Console fails to upgrade one or more Defenders, manually upgrade your Defenders.
endif::compute_edition[]

Console automatically upgrades most Defender types for you.
If Console fails to upgrade one or more Defenders, you will see error messages in the *Manage > Defenders > Manage* tab.
If youâ€™ve created an alert for Defender health events, Console emits a message on the alert channel for any Defender that it fails to upgrade.

=== Upgrade Console

To upgrade Console, update the service with a new task definition that points to the latest image.

This procedure assumes you're using images from Prisma Cloud's registry.
If you're using your own private registry, push the latest Console image there first.


[.task]
==== Copy the Prisma Cloud config file into place

[.procedure]
. xref:../welcome/releases.adoc#download[Download] the latest recommended release to your local machine.

  $ wget <LINK_TO_CURRENT_RECOMMENDED_RELEASE_LINK>

. Unpack the Prisma Cloud release tarball.

  $ mkdir twistlock
  $ tar xvzf twistlock_<VERSION>.tar.gz  -C twistlock/

. Upload the _twistlock.cfg_ files to the host that runs Console.

  $ scp twistlock.cfg <ECS_INFRA_NODE>:/twistlock_console/var/lib/twistlock-config


[.task]
==== Create a new revision of the task definition

Create a new revision of the task definition.

[.procedure]
. Log into the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS console].

. In the left menu, click *Task Definitions*.

. Check the box for the Prisma Cloud Console task definition, and click *Create new revision*.

. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Configure via JSON*.

.. Update the _image_ field to point to the latest Console image.
+
For example, if you were upgrading from Prisma Cloud version 2.4.88 to 2.4.95, simply change the version string in the image tag.
+
  "image": "registry-auth.twistlock.com/tw_<accesstoken>/twistlock/console:console_2_4_95"

.. Click *Save*.

. Click *Create*.


[.task]
==== Update the Console service

Update the Console service.

[.procedure]
. In the left menu of the Amazon ECS console, click *Clusters*.

. Click on your cluster.

. Select the *Services* tab.

. Check the box next the Console service, and click *Update*.

. In *Task Definition*, select the version of the task definition that points to the latest Console image.

. Validate that *Cluster*, *Service name*, and *Number of tasks* are correct.
These values are set based on the values for the currently running task, so the defaults should be correct.
The number of tasks must be 1.

. Set *Minimum healthy percent* to *0*.
+
This lets ECS safely stop the single Console container so that it can start an updated Console container.

. Set *Maximum percent* to *100*.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Configure network* page, accept the defaults, and click *Next*.

. In the *Set Auto Scaling* page, accept the defaults, and click *Next*.

. Click *Update Service*.
+
It takes a few moments for the old Console service to be stopped, and for the new service to be started.
Open Console, and validate that the UI shows new version number in the bottom left corner.

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage* and validate that Console has upgraded your Defenders.
+
If Console fails to upgrade any Defender, upgrade it xref:../upgrade/upgrade_defender_single_container.adoc[manually].
