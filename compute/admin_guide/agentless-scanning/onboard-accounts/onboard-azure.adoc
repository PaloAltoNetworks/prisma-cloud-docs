[#azure-onboarding]
== Onboard Azure Accounts for Agentless Scanning

ifdef::compute_edition[]

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a cloud workload without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the workload. Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders. Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on Azure hosts, containers, and clusters for vulnerabilities and compliance. To learn more about how agentless scanning works, see the xref:../agentless-scanning.adoc[How Agentless Scanning Works?]

This guide enables Agentless scanning for Prisma Cloud Compute Edition (PCCE or self-hosted) in Azure.
The procedure shows you how to complete the following tasks.

. <<#azure-create-role-agentless-pcce,Create a role and a service principal in Azure.>>
. <<#azure-configure-agentless-pcce,Configure agentless scanning in the Prisma Cloud console.>>
. <<#start-agentless-scan,Start an agentless scan.>>

[.task]
[#azure-create-role-agentless-pcce]
=== Create a Role and a Service Principal in Azure

[.procedure]
. Log in to Azure with the Azure CLI.
. Download the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/azure/azureAgentlessPermissions.json[azureAgentlessPermissions.json] file.
. Determine your `subscriptionId` with the following Azure CLI command.
+
[source,bash]
----
az account subscription list
----

. Replace `<subscriptionId>` in the `azureAgentlessPermissions.json` file with your Azure `subscriptionId`. You can find the field under the `"AssignableScopes": [ "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>"]` element.

. Create the role using the JSON file with the following Azure CLI command.
+
[source,bash]
----
az role definition create --role-definition azureAgentlessPermissions.json
----

. Create a Service Principal account with the following Azure CLI command.
+
[source,bash]
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name PCEE-Agentless --role "Prisma Cloud Compute Agentless Scanner" --scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionId> --sdk-auth
----

. Copy and save the returned JSON object for the Service Principal, for example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "clientId": "<clientId>",
  "clientSecret": "<clientSecret>",
  "subscriptionId": "<subscriptionId>",
  "tenantId": "<tenantId>",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
