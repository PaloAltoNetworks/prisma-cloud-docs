== Onboard Azure Accounts for Agentless Scanning

ifdef::compute_edition[]

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a cloud workload without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the workload. Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders. Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on Azure hosts, containers, and clusters for vulnerabilities and compliance. To learn more about how agentless scanning works, see the xref:../agentless-scanning.adoc[How Agentless Scanning Works?]

This guide enables Agentless scanning for Prisma Cloud Compute Edition (PCCE or self-hosted) in Azure.
The procedure shows you how to complete the following tasks.

. <<#azure-create-role-agentless-pcce,Create a role and a service principal in Azure.>>
. <<#azure-configure-agentless-pcce,Configure agentless scanning in the Prisma Cloud console.>>
. <<#start-agentless-scan,Start an agentless scan.>>

[.task]
[#azure-create-role-agentless-pcce]
=== Create a Role and a Service Principal in Azure

[.procedure]
. Log in to Azure with the Azure CLI.
. Download the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/azure/azureAgentlessPermissions.json[azureAgentlessPermissions.json] file.
. Determine your `subscriptionId` with the following Azure CLI command.
+
[source,bash]
----
az account subscription list
----

. Replace `<subscriptionId>` in the `azureAgentlessPermissions.json` file with your Azure `subscriptionId`. You can find the field under the `"AssignableScopes": [ "/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>"]` element.

. Create the role using the JSON file with the following Azure CLI command.
+
[source,bash]
----
az role definition create --role-definition azureAgentlessPermissions.json
----

. Create a service principal account with the following Azure CLI command.
+
[source,bash]
----
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name PCEE-Agentless --role "Prisma Cloud Compute Agentless Scanner" --scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionId> --sdk-auth
----

. Copy and save the returned JSON object for the service principal, for example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "clientId": "<clientId>",
  "clientSecret": "<clientSecret>",
  "subscriptionId": "<subscriptionId>",
  "tenantId": "<tenantId>",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}

image::agentless-configuration-azure.png[width=400]

... If you use a proxy for traffic leaving your Azure tenant, enter the *Proxy* address and add it's Certificate Authority certificate.

... Under *Scan scope* you can choose *All regions* to scan for VMs in all Azure regions. If you choose *Custom regions*, enter the Azure region in which you want Prisma Cloud to scan for VMs.

... Enter tags under *Exclude VMs by tags* to further limit the scope of the scan.

... Choose whether or not to *Scan non running hosts*

... Choose whether or not to enable *Auto-scale scanning*. If you disable auto-scale, specify number of scanners Prisma Cloud should employ.

... Enter the *Security group ID* and *Subnet ID*  that are created to allow the Prisma Cloud console to communicate back with Azure.

. Click *Next*.

. In the *Discovery features* page, leave the *Cloud discovery* settings unchanged.

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a cloud workload without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the workload. Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders. Currently, Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on Azure hosts, containers, and clusters for vulnerabilities and compliance. To learn more about how agentless scanning works, refer to our article on xref:../agentless-scanning-results.adoc[Agentless scanning architecture.]

This guide enables Agentless scanning for Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition (PCEE or SaaS) in Azure.
The procedure shows you how to complete the following tasks.

. <<#azure-get-details-agentless-pcee,Get the needed Azure Account details.>>
. <<#azure-onboard-agentless-pcee,Onboard Azure Cloud Account.>>
. <<#azure-configure-agentless-pcee,Configure agentless scanning in the Prisma Cloud console.>>
. <<#start-agentless-scan,Start an agentless scan.>>

[.task]
[#azure-get-details-agentless-pcee]
=== Get the Needed Azure Account Details

[.procedure]

. Log in to Azure with the Azure CLI.
. Query Azure for your tenant and subscription IDs. .
+
[source]
----
az account list
----

. Copy the output which is similar to the following example. In the output, identify the `tenantId` tenant ID and the `id` of the subscription.
+
[source,bash]
----
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
	    "homeTenantId": <This value is not needed>,
	    "id": <This is the subscription ID>,
	    "isDefault": true,
	    "managedByTenants": [],
