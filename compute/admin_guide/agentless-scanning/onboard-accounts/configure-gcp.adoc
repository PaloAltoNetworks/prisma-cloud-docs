=== Configure Agentless Scanning for GCP Accounts

[.procedure]

. Log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

. Select *Compute > Manage > Cloud Accounts*.

. Click the edit button of your cloud account.

. Go to the *Agentless Scanning* section.

. Hub accounts scan hosts in a different account. Enable the toggle to configure the account as a hub account.

. Expand the *Advanced settings*

.. *Select where to scan*: For GCP accounts, you can decide between xref:../agentless-scanning.adoc#scanning-modes[two scanning modes].

... *Same Account*: Perform the agentless scanning process using this account.

... *Hub Account*: Perform the agentless scanning process using a centralized hub account. Select another account from the list to use as the centralized hub account to scan this account.

.. *Auto-scale scanning*: Automatically create the required amount of scanners to scan all of the hosts within a region, up to a limit of 50 scanners. To use a different limit specify the *Max number of scanners*.

.. *Max number of scanners*: Enter the upper limit of scanners that Prisma Cloud can automatically spin up in your environment for faster results.

.. *Enforce permissions check*: If the needed permissions aren't in place, this account won't be scanned. If this is a hub account, its target accounts also won't be scanned.

.. Enter a *Proxy* value if traffic leaving your GCP tenant uses a proxy.

.. *Custom tags*: Apply custom tags to any resources Prisma Cloud creates during agentless scanning.

.. Under *Scan scope* you can refine the scope of the scanning by *Regions* or using tags.

... Choose *All regions* to scan in all GCP regions.
If you choose *Custom regions*, enter the GCP regions in which you want Prisma Cloud to scan.

... Choose whether or not to *Scan non running hosts*.

... Choose whether to *Exclude hosts by tags* or to *Include hosts by tags*.
You can use wildcards to specify a range of tags in both keys and values following these examples: `"abcd*"`, `"*abcd"`, `"abcd"`, `"*"`, `"*abcd*"`.

.. *Network resources*: Configure custom network resources for agentless scanning

... *Subnet*: If this value isn't provided, agentless scanning looks for the default subnet in the project to connect to Prisma Cloud. If the default subnet isn't available for that connections, enter the needed subnet.

. Click Next.

. Leave the *Discovery features* unchanged.

. Click *Save* to return to *Compute > Manage > Cloud accounts*.

==== Scan Encrypted Volumes When Using Hub Mode

When you use xref:../agentless-scanning-modes.adoc[hub and target projects], you can configure your hub project to access the encrypted volumes of the target accounts.
To use encrypted volumes the service account of Google Compute Engine needs to have the `cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role.
Without it, the service agent of the the hub project can't access the KMS keys.

The Compute Engine service agent for your hub project is labeled with the following convention.
`service-PROJECT_NUMBER@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
Replace `PROJECT_NUMBER` with the number of your hub project.

Use the following command to apply the grant the role and permissions to the Compute Engine service agent.

[source]
----
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding KMS_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:service-PROJECT_NUMBER@compute-system.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
----

Replace `KMS_PROJECT_ID` with any project you need to use.
The KMS project isn't required to be the hub account or the target accounts you wish to scan.
