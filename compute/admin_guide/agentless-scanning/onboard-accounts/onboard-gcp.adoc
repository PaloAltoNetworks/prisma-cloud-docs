== Onboard GCP Accounts for Agentless Scanning

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]

* Add your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud[GCP account to Prisma Cloud] in *Monitor and Protect* mode.
+
The Monitor and Protect mode has the permission required to enable agentless scanning in your account.

* You have added your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud[GCP account to Prisma Cloud], and selected *Monitor and Protect* mode.

* If you have an existing cloud account added to Prisma Cloud using the *Monitor* mode, you have updated it to use the *Monitor and Protect* mode.

* If you have an existing cloud account using *Monitor and Protect* that was added before June 2022, you have updated its CFT with the xref:../../configure/permissions.adoc[full permission list].

* You have enabled auto-assign public IPs on the subnet or security group used to connect your cloud account to the Prisma Cloud Console.

*** For existing GCP accounts, use the https://redlock-public.s3.amazonaws.com/gcp/gcpAgentlessPermissions.json[gcpAgentlessPermissions.json] permission template.

** Using *Monitor and Protect*, but was added before June 2022, you must update the Prisma Cloud role to add the permissions required for agentless scanning. See the xref:../../configure/permissions.adoc[full permission list].

* Verify that you can connect from your cloud account to the Prisma Cloud Console.
+
Unless you are using a proxy to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console, you must enable auto-assign public IPs on the subnet or security group you use to connect your cloud account to the Prisma Cloud Console.

.. *Console URL and Port:* The Prisma Cloud Console URL and port is automatically filled in.

.. *Scanning type:*
... *Same Account:* Scan hosts of a cloud account using the same cloud account.
... *Hub Account:* Scan hosts of a cloud account, known as the target account, using another cloud account, known as the hub account.
+
For a detailed instructions for each of the scanning modes and their corresponding permission templates, refer to the xref:../agentless-scanning.adoc#scanning-modes[scanning modes].

.. *HTTP Proxy:* To connect to the Prisma Cloud Console through a proxy, specify its URL.

.. *Regions:* Specify the regions to be scanned.

.. *Exclude VMs by tags:* Specify the tags used to ignore specific hosts. For example: `example:tag`

.. *Scan non-running hosts:* Enable to scan stopped hosts, that are not currently running.

.. *Auto-scale scanning:* When turned ON, Prisma Cloud automatically scales up / down multiple scanners for faster scans without any user-defined limits. Useful for large scale deployments.

.. *Number of scanners:* Define an upper limit to control the number of scanners Prisma Cloud can automatically spin up in your environment. Depending on the size of your environment, Prisma cloud will scale up / down scanners within the given limit for faster scans.

.. *Security groups:*

... *AWS:* Security group - If blank, Prisma Cloud uses the _default_ security group to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console. If the _default_ is not available, you must create and specify a custom security group. Otherwise, the connection from your account to the Prisma Cloud Console fails and no scan results are shown.

... *GCP:* Subnet - If blank, Prisma Cloud uses the _default_ subnet in your project to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console. If the _default_ is not available, you must create and specify a custom subnet. Otherwise, the connection from your project to the Prisma Cloud Console fails and no scan results are shown.

. Enable or disable the *Discovery features*.

. To complete the configuration, click the *Add account* button for new cloud accounts or the *Save* button for existing cloud accounts.

. If you are adding cloud account credentials, click the *Download* button to download its permission templates. Prisma Cloud validates the specified credentials and the download raises an error if the credentials are incorrect.
