== Configure Prisma Cloud Console's listening ports

This guide shows you how to configure Prisma Cloud to listen on different ports.
Typically this type of configuration is made at the load balancer layer, but it can be done directly with Prisma Cloud.

By default Prisma Cloud listens on:

* `8083` HTTPS management port for access to Console.
* `8084` WSS port for Defender *to* Console communication.

For more information, see the https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/downloads/Prisma Cloud-Reference-Architecture.pdf[Reference Architecture].

*If you are setting the port _below_ `1024` then Prisma Cloud needs permission to access this privileged port.
You must also set `RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT=${RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT:-false}` to true.*

*Prerequisite:* You have downloaded and unpacked the Prisma Cloud software.

[.procedure]
. Go to the directory where you unpacked the Prisma Cloud software.

. Open _twistlock.cfg_ for editing.
+
* `MANAGEMENT_PORT_HTTP` sets the HTTP access port, leaving this blank disables HTTP access.
+
Example: `MANAGEMENT_PORT_HTTP=${MANAGEMENT_PORT_HTTP-80}` configures Console to listen on port `80`.

* `MANAGEMENT_PORT_HTTPS` sets the HTTPS access port.
+
Example: `MANAGEMENT_PORT_HTTPS=443` configures Console to to listen on port `443`.

* `COMMUNICATION_PORT` sets the WSS port used for Defender to Console communication.
+
Example: `COMMUNICATION_PORT=9090` configures Console to listen on port `9090`.

. Run `twistlock.sh` to install Prisma Cloud Console with your settings.
+
*If you are setting the port _below_ `1024` then Prisma Cloud needs permission to access this privileged port.
You must also set `RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT=${RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT:-false}` to true.*
