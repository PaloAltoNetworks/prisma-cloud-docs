== Integrate Prisma Cloud scanning into the OpenShift build process

This guide demonstrates how to scan images emitted from the OpenShift (OSE) build process.
You can pass or fail the build process based on the severity of the vulnerability and compliance issues uncovered by the Prisma Cloud scanner called xref:../tools/twistcli.adoc#[twistcli].
The scanner produces actionable data that application developers can use to resolve issues.
This setup leverages the *postCommit* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/builds/build_hooks.html[build hook] to scan images before they're pushed to the registry.

You can also use postCommit hooks with https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/using_images/other_images/jenkins.html[OpenShift Jenkins] pipeline builds because pipeline builds integrate with the OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/dev_tutorials/openshift_pipeline.html#overview[BuildConfig] process.
Examples of OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline builds can be found https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline[here].

[.section]
=== Background

Every release of Prisma Cloud ships with a Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin called _prisma-cloud-jenkins-plugin.hpi_.
The Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin works with containerized local on-premises Jenkins and Cloudbees Jenkins.
This plugin is designed to be integrated into Jenkins Pipeline, Freestyle and Maven build workflows.
The Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin requires that the docker socket be mounted in the Jenkins container.
The docker socket is used when scanning an image that is being built by the Jenkins workflow.

The version of Jenkins included with OpenShift is specially modified for the OpenShift Container Platform.
From the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/dev_tutorials/openshift_pipeline.html[OpenShift docs]:

"In addition to standard Jenkins Pipeline Syntax, the OpenShift Jenkins image provides the OpenShift Domain Specific Language (DSL) (through the OpenShift Jenkins Client Plug-in), which aims to provide a readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent syntax for rich interactions with an OpenShift API server, allowing for even more control over the build, deployment, and promotion of applications on your OpenShift cluster."

The Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin does not understand the OpenShift Domain Specific Language nor does the OpenShift Jenkins Master and Slave containers mount the docker socket.
Therefore, the standard configuration of the Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin is not applicable to the OpenShift Jenkins.
But the OpenShift Jenkins leverages the OpenShift BuildConfig process as part of the Jenkins build process.
Prisma Cloud can scan images built via the OpenShift BuildConfig process via the postCommit build hook using the _twistcli_ utility.

Also from the OpenShift docs:

"The *postCommit* field of a *BuildConfig* object executes commands inside a temporary container that is running the build output image.
The hook is executed immediately after the last layer of the image has been committed and before the image is pushed to a registry.

â€¦

The hook fails if the script or command returns a non-zero exit code or if starting the temporary container fails.
When the hook fails it marks the build as failed and the image is not pushed to a registry.
The reason for failing can be inspected by looking at the build logs."

The twistcli scan of the image during the postCommit phase returns either success (exit 0) or error (exit 1) upon exit.
The OpenShift build process will either continue or stop based upon these exit codes.
You can configure the twistcli scan to pass/fail builds passed upon the vulnerabilities discovered in the image and configuration compliance.


[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud Console configuration

The Prisma Cloud scanning application is called xref:../tools/twistcli.adoc#[twistcli].
The twistcli scanner must authenticate to the Prisma Cloud Console's API to assess vulnerability and compliance data.
Since the CI User account is the least privileged account we will pass the credentials as part of the script in this example.
The CI User account does not have the rights to authenticate to the Prisma Cloud Console's user interface.
The  scanner itself accesses Console's API via the *twistlock-console.twislock.svc* OSE internal DNS FQDN.
You can use OpenShift secrets to protect the username/password of the CI User account.
See <<OpenShift secret for the Prisma Cloud credentials>>.

*Prerequisites:*
Prisma Cloud Console is fully operational.
See the Prisma Cloud xref:../install/install_openshift_3_11.adoc[OpenShift 3.11] and xref:../install/install_openshift_4.adoc[OpenShift 4] deployment guides.

Create a least privileged xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[CI User] account.

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add user*.

.. Username: *bob_the_builder*

.. Password: *twistlock2019*

.. Role: *CI User*
+
NOTE: If using SAML or Active Directory/OpenLDAP integration this account must be of type *Basic*


[.task]
=== Create and configure an OpenShift build

Modify the BuildConfig to scan an image, then build an image and review the results.

[.procedure]
. Log into OpenShift using *oc*.

. Create a new build.
This example build creates an image named _pfox-ose-build-scan-demo_ from the _registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7_ base image.

  $ oc new-build \
    -D $'FROM registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7' \
    --to=pfox-ose-build-scan-demo

. In the OpenShift Console, go to *Project > Builds > Builds*.
If you are using a Jenkins Pipeline, go to *Project > Builds > Pipelines*.

. Click on the *pfox-ose-build-scan-demo* build.

. In the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Edit YAML*.

. In the *spec: postCommit* node, add the following *script*, modifying it as necessary for your environment.
The `>-` characters are a block chomping indicator that strips the line feeds from the multi-line script string.
It's one of the ways to write multi-line strings in YAML files.
For a line-by-line breakdown of how the script works, see <<_postcommit_script,Post commit hook script>>.

  $ oc start-build pfox-ose-build-scan-demo

. Monitor the build logs.

  $ oc logs -f bc/pfox-ose-build-scan-demo


=== Looking at the results

Since twistcli is configured with _--vulnerability-threshold high_ and _--details_, the output contains detailed information for vulnerabilities in the image.

image::openshift_build_twistcli_scan1.png[width=800]

The pass/fail status of the twistcli scan is printed at the end of the scan.

image::openshift_build_twistcli_scan2.png[width=800]

If you want less verbosity from the scanner, remove the _--details_ option from the postCommit script.
To push the image to registry regardless of the scanner's findings, don't set any thresholds by removing the _--vulnerability-threshold high_ option.

[#_postcommit_script]
=== Post commit hook script

The postCommit script runs the Prisma Cloud scanner on the image just built.
This section describes how the script works.

[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  script: >-
    curl -k -ssl -u "bob_the_builder:twistlock2019" // See 1
    https://twistlock-console.twistlock.svc:8083/api/v1/util/twistcli -o twistcli &&
    chmod +x ./twistcli && // See 2
    ./twistcli images scan // See 3
    --containerized 
    --user bob_the_builder
    --password twistlock2019
    --address https://twistlock-console.twistlock.svc:8083
    --vulnerability-threshold high
    --details
    $OPENSHIFT_BUILD_NAME // See 4
----

* *1* -- Pulls the twistcli binary from Prisma Cloud Console API.
This guarantees that the Prisma Cloud Console and twistcli versions are synchronized.
Note that if the image being built does not contain curl, then add the twistcli application to the image itself.

* *2* -- Makes the twistcli binary executable.

* *3* -- Scans the image within the running container.
The https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/builds/build_hooks.html[postCommit field of a BuildConfig object] executes commands inside a temporary container that is running the build output image.

* *4* -- Name of the image being scanned based upon the build's environment variable.

The following options control how the scan runs:
See *twistcli images scan --help* for additional flags and details.

* _--containerized_ -- Run the scan from within a container.
* _--vulnerability-threshold high_ -- Minimum vulnerability threshold for failing the build on vulnerability checks.
* _--details_ -- Show all vulnerability details.

Twistcli returns an exit code of 1 if there are any xref:../vulnerability_management/cvss_scoring.adoc#[_high_] severity vulnerabilities in the image.
An exit code of 1 notifies the OSE start-build process that the postCommit task has failed and that the process should stop before the image is pushed to the registry.


[.task]
=== OpenShift secret for the Prisma Cloud credentials

Create an OpenShift generic secret to protect your CI User credentials.
These credentials are presented as environment variables to the script run in the postCommit stage.
More information about providing credentials to a BuildConfig, see OpenShift's docs on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.html#using-secrets-in-the-buildconfig[input secrets].

WARNING: The OpenShift build process will create environment variables containing the Prisma Cloud CI User account's username:password in the resulting image.

[.procedure]
. Log into OpenShift using *oc*, and go to the project where you run builds.

. Create files for the username and password.

    $ echo -n 'bob_the_builder' > ./username.txt
    $ echo -n 'twistlock2019' > ./password.txt

. Create an OpenShift generic secret with the username and password.

    $ oc create secret generic twistlock-scan \
      --from-file=username=./username.txt \
      --from-file=password=./password.txt

. Grant the builder service account access to the secret.

    $ oc secrets link builder twistlock-scan

. Create a new build.
This example build creates an image named _pfox-ose-build-scan-demo_ from the _registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7_ base image.
Associate the *twistlock-scan* secret with the build.

    $ oc new-build \
      -D $'FROM registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7' \
      --to=pfox-ose-build-scan-demo \
      --build-secret twistlock-scan

. In the OpenShift Console, go to *Project > Builds > Builds*.
If you are using a Jenkins Pipeline, go to *Project > Builds > Pipelines*.

. Click on the *pfox-ose-build-scan-demo* build.

. In the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Edit YAML*.

. Add in the *postCommit* script as instructed above.

. Modify the *spec:source* and *spec:strategy* nodes accordingly.
