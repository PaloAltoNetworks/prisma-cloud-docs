== Debug data

Console and Defender emit logs as they run.
These logs, also known as debug data, are designed to help troubleshoot operational issues.
They're different than audits, which are designed to report significant security events.

If you contact Prisma Cloud Support with an issue, you'll be asked to collect debug data from your setup and send it to us.
Debug data helps us find the root cause of problems, and provide timely resolutions.

For more information about how to collect and send us your debug data, see https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting/collect_debug_data.html[Troubleshooting].


=== Reviewing Console's debug logs

Go to *Manage > View Logs > Console*.


=== Reviewing Defender's debug logs

To view Defender's debug logs, go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.
Find the Defender of interest in the table of deployed Defenders, and then click *Actions > Logs*.
