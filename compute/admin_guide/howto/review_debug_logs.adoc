== Debug data

Console and Defender generate logs as they run.
These logs, also known as debug data, are designed to help troubleshoot operational issues.
They're different from audits, which are designed to report significant security events.

If you contact Prisma Cloud Support with an issue, you'll be asked to collect debug data from your setup and send it to us.
Debug data helps us find the root cause of problems, and provide timely resolutions.


=== Collect Console debug logs

The simplest way to view Console's debug logs is from within the UI itself.
Go to *Manage > Logs > Console* and *Download Logs*.


=== Collect Defender debug logs

To view Defender's debug logs, go to *Manage > Defenders > Defenders: Deployed*.
Select the Defender from the table and then click *Actions > Logs* and *Download Logs*.
