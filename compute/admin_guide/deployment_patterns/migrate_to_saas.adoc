== Migrating to a SaaS Console

If you are interested in moving from Prisma Cloud Compute Edition (self-hosted) to Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition (SaaS), there is a migration method to move some of your data and configuration.
Contact your Renewals Manager or Customer Success Team to discuss in further detail.
This is a process we must assist you with.

Points to consider:

* This is a one-time migration. 
* The direction is Prisma Cloud Compute Edition to Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition.
You cannot migrate from Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition to Prisma Cloud Compute Edition.
* If you have projects enabled with Prisma Cloud Compute Edition, you will need to break them apart and pick a single Console to migrate.
* Your Prisma Cloud Compute Edition Console version must match exactly to the Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Console, which is always the latest version of Prisma Cloud Compute that is available.
