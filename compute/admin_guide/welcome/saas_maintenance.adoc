**Details:**
// GH fix: https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/29235

Fixing errors with AWS credentials in Compute Consoles regarding a failure to retrieve AWS functions/metadata. 
This fix is done via Console upgrade. 
Upgrade version: 20.12.550


The issue is caused by the console using credentials that use the EC2 IAM role .
This type of credential queries the instance metadata service for the EC2 instance role when used and because Compute Consoles run in GCP, the credentials fail with error below -

EC2RoleRequestError: no EC2 instance role found
