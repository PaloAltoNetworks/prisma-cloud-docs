== NAT gateway IP addresses

To ensure that Prisma Cloud Defenders can communicate with the Prisma Cloud Compute Console, and that you can access Prisma™ Cloud and the API for any integrations that you enabled between Prisma Cloud and your incidence response workflows, review the list below and update the IP addresses in your allow lists.

For a comprehensive list of NAT gateway IP addresses and domains for all Prisma Cloud modules and capabilities, refer to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console[access the Prisma Cloud console].

=== Tenant mappings

The tables below are detailed by the stack in which your Prisma Cloud tenant is deployed. 
To recognize your Prisma Cloud app stack / Tenant region, check the URL in browser when logging into your Prisma Cloud tenant. 

Example: https://app3.prismacloud.io/ 
The "app3" in address indicates your Prisma Cloud tenant region.

To recognize your Compute Console region, find the region in the URL for **Path to Console** under **Manage > System > Utilities** tab in Compute Console.

Example: https://us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-xxxxxx
The "us-west1" indicates your Compute Console region.
