== NAT gateway IP addresses

Prisma™ Cloud uses the following NAT gateway IP addresses. To ensure that you can access Prisma Cloud and the API for any integrations that you enabled between Prisma Cloud and your incidence response workflows, or for your Prisma Cloud Defenders to communicate with the Prisma Cloud Compute Console, review the list and update the IP addresses in your allow lists.

=== Tenant mappings

The tables below are detailed by the stack in which your Prisma Cloud tenant is deployed. 
To recognize your Prisma Cloud app stack / Tenant region, check the URL in browser when logging into your Prisma Cloud tenant. 

Example: https://app3.prismacloud.io/ 
The "app3" in address indicates your Prisma Cloud tenant region.

To recognize your Compute Console region, find the region in the URL for **Path to Console** under **Manage > System > Utilities** tab in Compute Console.

Example: https://us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-xxxxxx
The "us-west1" indicates your Compute Console region.
