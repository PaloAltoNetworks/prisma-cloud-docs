== Product architecture

Prisma Cloud offers a rich set of cloud workload protection capabilities.
Collectively, these features are called _Compute_.
Compute has a dedicated management interface, called _Compute Console_, that can be accessed in one of two ways, depending on the product you have.

* *Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition* --
Hosted by Palo Alto Networks.
Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition is a SaaS offering.
It includes both the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) modules.
Access the Compute Console, which contains the CWPP module, from the *Compute* tab in the Prisma Cloud UI.

* *Prisma Cloud Compute Edition* -
Hosted by you in your environment.
Prisma Cloud Compute Edition is a self-hosted offering that's deployed and managed by you.
It includes the Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) module only.
Download the Prisma Cloud Compute Edition software from the Palo Alto Networks Customer Support Portal.
Compute Console is delivered as a container image, so you can run it on any host with a container runtime (e.g. Docker Engine).

The following table summarizes the differences between the two offerings:
