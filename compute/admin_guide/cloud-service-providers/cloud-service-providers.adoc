By default, Compute feature-specific minimalist permissions are added to all CloudFormation Templates for AWS, Azure and GCP accounts onboarded to Prisma Cloud.
The following two onboarding modes define these permissions: *Monitor* and *Monitor & Protect*.

You can review the xref:../configure/permissions.adoc[list of all features and their corresponding permissions].

==== Cloud Account Permission Status

Currently, cloud account status checks don't take Prisma Cloud Compute permissions into account.
They remain green even if Prisma Cloud Compute permissions are missing in order to accommodate Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) users who do not use Prisma Cloud Compute functionalities. For them, changing the account permissions status could cause confusion.

Contact support to request enablement of status checks on your tenant.
