== Azure Key Vault

You can integrate Prisma Cloud with Azure Key Vault.
First configure Prisma Cloud to access your Key Vault, then create rules to inject the relevant secrets into their associated containers.

*Prerequisites:* You have https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal#add-a-secret-to-key-vault[created a secret] in Key Vault.

[.procedure]
. Create an Azure servicePrincipal in your Azure AD Tenant

.. Use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[AZ CLI] to create a servicePrincipal and obtain the json credential file.

.. Authenticate to your Azure tenant.

  $ az login

.. Create a servicePrincipal 

  $ az ad sp create-for-rbac

.. Save the resulting json output.+

  {
    "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx",
    "displayName": "azure-cli-2018-11-01-xx-xx-xx",
    "name": "http://azure-cli-2018-11-01-xx-xx-xx",
    "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "tenant": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }

.. In the Azure Key Vault, add the servicePrincipal to the *Access Policies* with the following permissions:
+
  secrets/get permission
  secrets/list permission

. In the Prisma Cloud Console, go to *Manage > Authentication > Secrets*.

. Click *Add store*.

.. Enter a name for the vault.
This name is used when you create rules to inject secrets into specific containers.

.. For *Type*, select *Azure Key Vault*.

.. For *Address*, enter *\https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net*.
This address can be found in the Azure Key Vault's properties in the _DNS Name_ element.

.. In *Credential*, click *Add new*.

.. Enter a name for the credentials.

.. In *Type*, select *Azure*.

.. In *Service Key*, enter the JSON credentials returned from the _az ad sp create-for-rbac_ command.

.. Click *Save*.

.. Click *Add*.
+
After adding the new store, Prisma Cloud tries conecting to your vault.
If it is successful, the dialog closes, and an entry is added to the table.
Otherwise, any connection errors are displayed directly in the configuration dialog.
