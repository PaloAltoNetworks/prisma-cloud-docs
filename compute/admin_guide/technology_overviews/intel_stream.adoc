== Intelligence Stream

The Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream (IS) is a real-time feed that contains vulnerability data and threat intelligence from commercial providers, Prisma Cloud Labs, and the open source community.

Console automatically connects to intelligence.twistlock.com and downloads updates without any special configuration required.
The IS is updated several times per day, and Console continuously checks for updates.
