== TLS v1.2 cipher suites

Prisma Cloud Compute uses the Go programming language cryptographic libraries to protect all network communications via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2 protocol.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
NOTE: The Lagrange release's (22.12+) Console, Defender and twistcli Compute components can run using FIPS140-2 Level 1 validated cryptographic modules.
See xref:../howto/deploy_in_fips_mode.adoc[Deploy in FIPS mode] for more information.

=== Prisma Cloud Compute Self-Hosted

The User Interface (UI) and API access is protected using server side TLS v1.2 authentication.
The cipher suites offered by the Console adhere to https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r2.pdf[NIST SP800-52r2] guidance.

* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

The Console enforces HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

==== Console to Defender communication

The Console and Defenders communication using a mutual TLS v1.2 web-socket session (default TCP 8084).
The allowed cypher suites used for this communication adhere to https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r2.pdf[NIST SP800-52r2] guidance.

* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

The certificate/keys used for the Console to Defender mutual TLS v1.2 web socket session are generated during the Console's initiation process.
The reason for this is to ensure the Console is only communicating with the Defenders it has deployed and the Defenders only communicate with its controlling Console.

=== Prisma Cloud Compute Enterprise (SaaS)

The Compute Console runs within a Google Cloud Platform’s Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The GKE Console containers are fronted by GCP Load Balancers that have been configured to use the https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-policies-concepts[Modern] pre-configured profile. The Modern profile supports a wide set of SSL features, allowing modern clients to negotiate SSL.

==== Console to Defender communication (SaaS)

The SaaS Console and Defender communication uses the same TCP port (i.e. 443) and cipher suites as the UI/API endpoint.


=== Credential store's secrets storage

Local username/password accounts within a local database table using HMAC256.
This is in compliance with https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-107r1.pdf[NIST SP800-107r1].
Currently, there are seven approved hash algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4: SHA-1, SHA-224, *SHA-256*, SHA-384 SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.

==== NSA approved

The https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/iad-initiatives/cnsa-suite.cfm[NSA’s Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite] provides cryptographic guidance for replacement of Suite B algorithms prior to the availability of quantum resistant algorithms.
"For those customers who are looking for mitigations to perform while the new algorithm suite is developed and implemented into products, there are several things they can do."
These recommendations have been implemented within Prisma Cloud’s cryptographic settings.
