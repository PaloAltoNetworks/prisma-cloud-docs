== Runtime defense for App-Embedded

App-Embedded Defenders monitor your App-Embedded containers including AWS Fargate tasks to ensure they execute as designed, protecting containers from running suspicious processes or making suspicious network connections.

Policies let you define:

* Allow process activity.
Enables verification of launched processes against policy.

* Allow networking activity.
Enables verification of domain name resolution, and inbound and outbound network connections.

* Configure custom rules policy. For details refer to xref:../runtime_defense/custom_runtime_rules.adoc[Custom runtime rules].  

Besides runtime policy, you can also configure the xref:../waas/waas.adoc[WAAS] application firewall to protect front-end Fargate containers.


=== Securing your App-Embedded containers
To secure App-Embedded containers including Fargate tasks, embed the Prisma Cloud App-Embedded Defender into it.
The steps are:

. Define your policy in Prisma Cloud Console under *Defend > Runtime > App-Embedded policy*.
. Embed the App-Embedded Defender into your Container or task definition.
.. xref:../install/install_defender/install_app_embedded_defender_fargate.adoc[install App-Embedded Defender for Fargate]
.. xref:../install/install_defender/install_rasp_defender.adoc[Install App Embedded Defender]
. Start the service.


=== Securing Fargate tasks
The following provides an example for how to secure your AWS Fargate tasks.


[.task]
==== Defining your policy

Add runtime protection for your App-Embedded by defining a runtime rule for it in Prisma Cloud Console.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud ships with a default App-Embedded runtime policy.
App-Embedded Defenders dynamically retrieve policies from Console as they are updated.
You can embed App-Embedded Defender into a task/container with empty or very simple initial policies, and refine them as needed later.

This procedure demonstrates how to block the *Sample task* (in the next paragraph, from executing a new process and establishing outbound network connections.
You will create a new rule that prevents _mkdir_ from running in the container named _twistlock-fargate-task_, and blocks outbound network requests to _yahoo.com_.
If you've got your own task, configure the rule to meet your own specific objectives.
By default, new rules apply to all images and containers (`{asterisk}`), but you can target them to specific images or containers using xref:../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc[pattern matching].

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Defend > Runtime > App Embedded Policy*.

. Click *Add rule*.

.. Enter a rule name.

.. By default, the rule applies to all images and all containers.
+
Target the rule to specific images or containers.
A task definition declares the container name in the containerDefinitions->name field.

.. Click the *Networking* tab.

.. Enable *DNS* toggle 

.. Set *Effect* to *Prevent*.

.. Add _gmail.com_ to the *DNS allow list*
+
NOTE: Rules are designed to allow by default or deny by default.
If you specify an allow list, then everything outside the allow list is denied by default.
If you specify a deny list, then everything outside the deny list is allowed by default.

.. Click *Save*.


==== Sample task

You can use the following sample task definition to test Prisma Cloud's Fargate Defender.
The associated container includes an _entry.sh_ script that runs *mkdir* and then makes various outbound network requests to *yahoo.com* and *google.com* using *wget*.
It then sleeps for 5 minutes and exits.

==== Deploy Fargate task

Deploy the the above sample task definition, following the steps in xref:../install/install_defender/install_app_embedded_defender_fargate.adoc[Embed App-Embedded Defender into Fargate tasks].


====  View runtime audits

Since the container associated with your task automatically executes mkdir and wget in the `entrypoint` script, simply launch your Fargate task, wait a few minutes, then review the audits in Prisma Cloud Console.

After a short time has passed, audits appear in Prisma Cloud Console.
To review them, go to *Monitor > Events > App Embedded Audits*.
You should see audits with the following messages:

  DNS resolution of domain name yahoo.com triggered by /usr/bin/wget explicitly denied by a runtime rule
