== Email alerts

Prisma Cloud can send email alerts when your policies are violated.
Audits in *Monitor > Events* are the result of a policy violation.
Prisma Cloud can be configured to notify the appropriate party by email when an entire policy, or even specific rules, are violated.

NOTE: Because Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Compute Console is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, outbound connections to port 25 from Console are blocked.
All other ports are available, including ports 587 and 465.
