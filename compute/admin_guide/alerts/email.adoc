== Email alerts

Prisma Cloud can send email alerts when your policies are violated.
Audits in *Monitor > Events* are the result of a policy violation.
Prisma Cloud can be configured to notify the appropriate party by email when an entire policy, or even specific rules, are violated.

NOTE: Because Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Compute Console is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, outbound connections to port 25 from Console are blocked.
All other ports are available, including ports 587 and 465.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail[here].

. In *Credential*, create the credentials required to access the email account that sends alerts.
This isn't a required field.

.. Select *Add new*.

.. Select *Basic authentication*.

.. Enter a username and password.

. If you're using SMTPS (your SMTP connection is secured by SSL), set *SSL* to *On*.

==== Unable to test Email Alerts for 'smtp.office365.com' on port 587.

*Error*: `tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake`

image::CWP-39492-email-alert-failed-TLS-handshake.png[width=250]

Prisma Cloud fails to send test alerts to 'smtp.office365.com' on port 587 after enabling *SSL*.

*Cause*:

In the SMTP protocol that Prisma Cloud Console uses to send Email Alerts, there is a following standard flow in which the client (Prisma Cloud Console) requests the server to convert an existing plain-text connection to an encrypted connection:

* The client (in this case the PCC console) sends the message “EHLO” to the server (e.g. smtp.office365.com).
* The server responds with available extensions, one of which is “STARTTLS“.
* The client responds with “STARTTLS“.
* The server acknowledges receiving the “STARTTLS”.
* The client issues a TLS handshake with the server.
* Once the handshake is successful, all communication with the server from here on is encrypted.

We support using 'STARTTLS' to encrypt Email Alerts sent over SMTP if the mail server supports it.
With 'smtp.office365.com' and 'smtp-legacy.office365.com' using port 587, 'STARTTLS' is used, which encrypts subsequent communication even without 'SSL' toggle being enabled.

[.procedure]

. Configure the alert profile settings with the SMTP address on same port '587' with *SSL* disabled.
