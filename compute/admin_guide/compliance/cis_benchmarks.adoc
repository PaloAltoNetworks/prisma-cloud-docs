== CIS Benchmarks

The CIS Benchmarks provide consensus-oriented best practices for securely configuring systems.
Prisma Cloud provides checks that validate the recommendations in the following CIS Benchmarks:

* https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/[Docker Benchmark]
* https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/[Kubernetes Benchmark]
* https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/distribution_independent_linux/[Distribution Independent Linux]
* https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/[Amazon Web Services Foundations]

We have graded each check using a system of four possible scores: critical, high, medium, and low.
This scoring system lets you create compliance rules that take action depending on the severity of the violation.
If you want to be reasonably certain that your environment is secure, you should address all critical and high checks.
By default, all critical and high checks are set to alert, and all medium and low checks are set to ignore.
We expect customers to review, but probably never fix, medium and low checks.

There are just a handful of checks graded as critical.
Critical is reserved for things where your container environment is exposed to the Internet, and can result in a direct attack by somebody on the outside.
They should be addressed immediately.

// For DistroIndependent Linux checks that weren't implemented, see https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/6454
Prisma Cloud has not implemented CIS checks marked as _Not Scored_.
These checks are are hard to define in a strict way.
Other checks are might not implemented because the logic is resource-heavy, results depend on user input, or files cannot be parsed reliably.


=== Additional details about Prisma Cloud's implementation of the CIS benchmarks

The compliance rule dialog provides some useful information.
Compliance rules for containers can be created under *Defend > Compliance > Containers and Images*, while compliance rules for hosts can be created under *Defend > Compliance > Hosts*.

*Benchmark versions* -- To see which version of the CIS benchmark is supported in the product, click on the *All types* drop-down list.

[NOTE]
====
Prisma Cloud hasn't implemented the following checks from the CIS Distribution Independent Linux benchmark:

* _1.7.2 - Ensure GDM login banner is configured_ --
By default, most server distributions ship without a windows manager.
A manual assessment is required.

* _2.2.1.2 - Ensure ntp (Network Time Protocol) is configured_ --
CIS did not score this recommendation.
A manual assessment is required.

* _2.2.1.3 - Ensure chrony is configured_ --
CIS did not score this recommendation.
A manual assessment is required.

* _5.3.1 - Ensure password creation requirements are configured_ --
This recommendation cannot be implemented generically because password requirements vary from organization to organization.
A manual assessment is required.
