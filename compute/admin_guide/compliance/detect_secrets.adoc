== Detect Secrets

Prisma Cloud can detect sensitive information that is improperly secured inside images and containers.
Scans can detect embedded passwords, login tokens, and other types of secrets.
To detect improperly secured secrets, add the following checks to your xref:../compliance/manage_compliance.adoc#[compliance policy].


=== Defender Secrets Detection

Your deployed defenders detect sensitive information inside images and containers.
Select *Monitor > Compliance > Compliance Explorer* and search the results using the following compliance check IDs.

==== Compliance Check ID 424

This check detects sensitive information provided in environment variables of image.
The data so provided can be easily exposed by running `docker inspect` on the image and thus compromising privacy.

*Example*

  $ docker --tlsverify -H :9998 build -t secret:v1 .

*Response*

  Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
  Step 1/2 : FROM alpine:latest
   ---> 88e169ea8f46
  Step 2/2 : ENV PASSWORD = secret
   ---> Using cache
   ---> 8f3627bc339b
  Error: [Prisma Cloud] Image operation blocked by policy: (No secrets attached), violates: The environment variable PASSWORD contains sensitive data


==== Compliance Check ID 425

This check detects private keys stored in an image.

*Example*

Navigate to *Defend > Compliance*.
Add a new compliance rule to block running an image with private key in it.

*Test*

  $ docker --tlsverify -H  user.c.cto-sandbox.internal:9998 build -t user:secretv1

*Response*

  Sending build context to Docker daemon 5.632 kB
  Step 1/2 : FROM alpine:latest
   ---> 88e169ea8f46
  Step 2/2 : ADD private_key /root/.ssh/id_rsa
   ---> Using cache
   ---> c6e8e2496663
  Error: [Prisma Cloud] Image operation blocked by policy: (No secrets attached), violates: Private keys stored in image /root/.ssh/id_rsa

Set the action to *ALERT* instead of *BLOCK*, then go to *Monitor > Compliance* after running the image.
Click on the image under *Images* tab.

==== Compliance Check ID 597

This check detects sensitive information provided in environment variables of container.

[#agentless-secrets-detection]
=== Agentless Secrets Detection

Agentless scanning detects sensitive information inside files in your hosts and container images filesystem.

==== Compliance Check ID 456

This check detects secrets inside your hosts' filesystem.
By default, Prisma Cloud alerts you that a secret was detected in a host.
Select *Monitor > Compliance > Compliance Explorer* and search the results using the compliance check ID.

==== Compliance Check ID 457

This check detects secrets inside your container images' filesystem.
By default, Prisma Cloud alerts you that a secret was detected in a container image.
Select *Monitor > Compliance > Compliance Explorer* and search the results using the compliance check ID.

[#detected-secrets]
==== Detected Secrets

When agentless scanning detects a secret in a host or container image, only the following information is sent to the Prisma Cloud console.

* The xref:#secret-types[secret type]

* A redacted snippet of the secret with a length of less than 10 characters

** A maximum of 10% of the visible characters for secrets above 30 characters up to a maximum of 10 characters
** A maximum of 3 visible characters for secrets under 30 characters

* The path to the file where the secret was detected

* The line and offset in the file where the secret was detected in the `line:offset` format

This information provides you with enough context to find the detected secret and take any needed action.
