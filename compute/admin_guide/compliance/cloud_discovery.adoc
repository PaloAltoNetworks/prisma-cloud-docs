== Cloud discovery

It's difficult to ensure that all your apps running on all the different types of cloud services are being properly secured. If you're using multiple cloud platforms, you might have many separate accounts per platform. You could easily have hundreds of combinations of providers, accounts, and regions where cloud native services are being deployed.

Cloud discovery helps you find all cloud-native services being used on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, across all regions, and across all accounts.
It enables you to continuously monitor these accounts, detect when new services are added, and report on the services that are unprotected, so that you can mitigate your exposure to rogue deployments, abandoned environments, and sprawl.

Cloud discovery offers coverage for the following services.

*Registries:*

* AWS
* Azure
* Google Artifact Registry
* Google Container Registry^1,2^

*Serverless functions:*

* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud

^3^ *Managed platforms:*

* AWS ECS
* AWS EKS
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Azure Container Instances (ACI)
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

*Virtual machines:*

* AWS EC2 instances
* Azure VMs^3^
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine VM instances^3^


^1^Although Artifact Registry supports a number of content types (for example, Java, Node.js, and Python language packs), Prisma Cloud only supports discovering and scanning Docker images.

^2^Prisma Cloud doesn't support scanning Helm charts saved as OCI images and stored in Artifact Registry.
The OCI image that represents a Helm chart has a single layer that contains the Helm package.
It is only a way to store a Helm chart, but it has no meaning in terms of a container.
Prisma Cloud has no way to run the image to scan it.
Note that Helm charts stored as OCI images will be shown in the list of resources discovered in the registry because we can't indicate their type until we actually pull and scan them.

^3^Auto-defend is currently not yet available for these services.
Auto-defend utilizes rule-based policies to automatically deploy Prisma Cloud to protect resources in your environment.

NOTE: Cloud discovery won't find Google Artifact Registry and Google Container Registry when credentials are imported from Prisma Cloud.
They will be found if the credentials are created in  *Compute > Manage > Cloud accounts*.

[#min_perms]
=== Minimum permissions

Prisma Cloud needs one set of minimum permissions to discover and itemize all the resources in your account.
After finding those resources, Prisma Cloud typically needs an additional set of permissions to protect them (e.g. retrieve those resources and inspect them for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

For example, the service account for cloud discovery uses the `ecr:DescribeRepositories` permission to list all ECR repositories in your AWS accounts.
If you find a repository that's not being scanned, and you want to configure Prisma Cloud to scan it, Prisma Cloud needs another service account with deeper permissions that lets it auth with the ECR service and download images from the repository (e.g., `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`, etc).
The permissions required for cloud discovery to scan your accounts are documented here.
Permissions required to enable protection (e.g. scanning a repo) are documented in each protection feature's respective article.


==== AWS

For AWS, Prisma Cloud requires a service account with following minimum permissions policy:

[source,json]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PrismaCloudComputeCloudDiscovery",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeTags",
                "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
                "ecs:DescribeClusters",
                "ecs:ListClusters",
                "ecs:ListContainerInstances",
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "eks:ListClusters",
                "lambda:GetFunction",
                "lambda:ListFunctions"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----


==== Azure

For Azure, Prisma Cloud requires a role with the following minimum permissions:

[source,json]
----
{
    "permissions": [
        {
            "actions": [
                "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/read",
                "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/metadata/read",
                "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
                "Microsoft.Web/sites/Read",
                "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/read",
                "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/containers/exec",
                "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read",
                "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/read",
                "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/read",
                "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/instanceView/read"
            ],
            "notActions": [],
            "dataActions": [],
            "notDataActions": []
        }
    ]
}
----
The `Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/containers/exec` checks for whether ACI is defended.

==== Google Cloud

For GCP, Prisma Cloud requires a xref:../authentication/credentials_store.adoc#google-cloud-platform-gcp[service account with the viewer role].
The basic role `roles/viewer`, however, is very broad with thousands of permissions across all Google Cloud services.

For production environments, use a more tightly scoped service account with the following predefined roles:

Predefined roles:

* Artifact Registry Reader (https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles[`roles/artifactregistry.reader`])
* Storage Object Viewer (`roles/storage.objectViewer`)
* Kubernetes Engine Cluster Viewer (`roles/container.clusterViewer`)
* Cloud Functions Viewer (`roles/cloudfunctions.viewer`)

Also, create custom role with the following permissions, and attach it to your serivce account.

* `compute.instances.list`
* `compute.zones.list`
* `compute.projects.get`
* `cloudfunctions.functions.sourceCodeGet` # Required for serverless function scanning


[.task]
=== Configuring cloud platforms discovery

Set up Prisma Cloud to scan your cloud platform accounts for cloud-native resources and services.
Then configure Prisma Cloud to protect them with a single click.

*Prerequisites:* You created service accounts for your cloud providers that provide the minimum required permissions, as described <<min_perms,here>>.

[.procedure]
. Log in to Prisma Cloud Compute Console.

. Select *Compute > Manage > Cloud Accounts*.

. Select the accounts to scan. If there are no accounts in the table, use the *+ Add account* button to onboard your cloud accounts.
+
[NOTE]
====
* On GCP: If you select organization level GCP credentials, for an organization with hundreds of projects, the performance of the Google Cloud Registry discovery might be affected due to long query time from GCP.
The best approach to reduce scan time and avoid potential timeouts is to divide the projects in your organization into multiple GCP folders.
Then create a service account and credential for each folder, and use these credentials for cloud discovery.
* On Azure: If you create a credential in the credentials store under *Manage > Authentication > Credentials store*, your service principal authenticates with a password.
To authenticate with a certificate, xref:../authentication/cloud_accounts.adoc[create a cloud account].
====

. Enable *Cloud discovery*. 

. Click *Add account* to save the changes.

. Review the scan report.

..  Go to *Compute > Manage > Cloud Accounts* to view the scan report as a table.
... Select the *Show account details* icon to see the discovery scan results for resources within the cloud account.
+
image::cloud_discovery_details_selfhosted.png[]

..  Go to *Radar* and select *Cloud* to view the scan report as a graphic.
+
image::cloud_discovery_radar_selfhosted.png[]

..  Click *Defend* for the entities you want Prisma Cloud to scan for vulnerabilities.
+
When you click *Defend*, a new scan rule is proposed.
Select the appropriate credential, tweak the scan rule as desired, then click *Add*.

..  Go to the scan reports under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities*

.. Select *Hosts*, *Registry*, or *Functions* to see the pertinent report.

=== Troubleshooting

Ensure you have the right permissions for the account before you start with cloud discovery. 

==== Empty results from Cloud Discovery

Cloud discovery results are visible per account.
If you have multiple credentials associated with the same account, the results are only displayed for one credential to avoid duplication.
The other credentials for the same account will show empty results.
To view comprehensive results for all credentials, navigate to Cloud Radar *Radars > Cloud*.
