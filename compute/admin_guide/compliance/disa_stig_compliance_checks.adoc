== DISA STIG compliance checks

Prisma Cloud supports the Docker Enterprise 2.x Linux/Unix STIG - Ver 2, Rel 1 and the Kubernetes STIG - Ver 1, Rel 2 compliance checks.
Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guides (DISA STIGs) contain technical guidance to lock down systems that might otherwise be vulnerable to attack.
These STIGs help ensure your environments are properly secured, based on Department of Defense guidance.
Prisma Cloud will continue to incorportate DISA STIG guidance as existing STIGs are updated and new STIGs are published. 

For an overview of the STIG, see https://github.com/clemenko/stig_blog/blob/master/U_Docker_Enterprise_2-x_Linux-UNIX_V1R1_Overview.pdf[here].

To download the STIGs, see https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/[here].


=== Checks

Prisma Cloud Compute has a compliance template "DISA STIG" for images, containers and hosts.
This compliance template maps individual STIG rules to existing compliance checks within Compute.
In some cases, we've implemented checks specficially to support the STIGs.
When configuring your compliance policy, simply select the DISA STIG template to enable ("Alert") all relevant checks.


==== CAT I

CAT I is a category code for any vulnerability, which when exploited, will _directly and immediately_ result in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity.
These risks are the most severe.

The following table lists the CAT I checks implemented in Prisma Cloud, and how they map to existing Prisma Cloud checks.
All CAT I checks, except DKER-EE-001070, map to CIS Docker Benchmark checks.
A separate check has been implemented for DKER-EE-001070 to support the Docker Enterprise STIG.
