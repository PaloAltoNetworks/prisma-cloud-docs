== Host scanning

Prisma Cloud scans all hosts where Defender is installed.

Defender scans hosts for the following types of vulnerabilities:

* *Host configuration*: Vulnerabilities in the host setup.

* *Docker daemon configuration*: Vulnerabilities that stem from misconfiguring your Docker daemons. Docker daemon derives its configuration from various files, including /etc/sysconfig/docker or /etc/default/docker. Misconfigured daemons affect all container instances on a host.

* *Docker daemon configuration files*: Vulnerabilities that arise from improperly securing critical configuration files with the correct permissions.

* *Docker security operations*: Recommendations and reminders for extending your current security best practices to include containers.

Prisma Cloud implements the checks from:

* CIS Distribution Independent Linux v2.0.0.
* CIS Amazon Linux 2 Benchmark v1.0.0 (for AL 2)
* CIS Amazon Linux Benchmark v2.1.0 (for AL 1)

=== Reviewing host scan reports

Prisma Cloud lets you filter the displayed hosts by searching for specific hosts or by xref:../configure/collections.adoc[collection].
Collections support AWS tags.
When creating new collections, specify the tags you want to use for filtering in the *Labels* field.
