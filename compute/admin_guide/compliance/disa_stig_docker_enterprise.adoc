== Docker Enterprise DISA STIG

Prisma Cloud supports the Docker Enterprise DISA STIG.
STIGs contain technical guidance to lock down systems that might otherwise be vulnerable to attack.
This STIG ensures government agencies run Docker Enterprise securely.

For an overview of the STIG, see https://github.com/clemenko/stig_blog/blob/master/U_Docker_Enterprise_2-x_Linux-UNIX_V1R1_Overview.pdf[here].
To download the STIG, see https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/stigs/zip/U_Docker_Enterprise_2-x_Linux-UNIX_V1R1_STIG.zip[here].


=== Checks

Prisma Cloud offers a compliance template for the Docker Enterprise DISA STIG.
In many cases, DISA STIG checks map to checks already supported in the product.
In some cases, we've implemented checks specficially to support the Docker Enterprise STIG.
When configuring your compliance policy, simply select the DISA STIG template to enable all relevant checks.


==== CAT I

CAT I is a category code for any vulnerability, which when exploited, will _directly and immediately_ result in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity.
These risks are the most severe.

The following table lists the CAT I checks implemented in Prisma Cloud, and how they map to existing Prisma Cloud checks.
All CAT I checks, except DKER-EE-001070, map to CIS Docker Benchmark checks.
A separate check has been implemented for DKER-EE-001070 to support the Docker Enterprise STIG.
