== Custom feeds

You can supplement the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream with your own custom data, including:

* Banned IP addresses.
* Malware signatures.
* Trusted executables.
* xref:../vulnerability_management/customize_image_scanning.adoc#scanning-custom-components[Custom vulnerabilities for proprietary software components.].
* Allowed CVEs.

For each data type, you can add individual entries to a table from the Console UI, bulk upload a list from a CSV file, or submit a JSON object via the Prisma Cloud API.


[.task]
=== Supplementing the IP reputation list

You can supplement the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream with your own list of banned IP addresses.
Update your custom IP reputation list from the Console UI.
You can specify one entry at a time, or do a bulk upload from a CSV file.
The maximum file size is 20MB.

The first line in your CSV file must be a header record that contains the field names.
Specify one IP address per line.
For example:

  ip
  99.104.125.48
  101.200.81.187
  103.19.89.118

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Manage > System > Custom Feeds*.

. Click *IP Reputation Lists*, and either click *Add* or *Import CSV*.
+
Your list of banned IP addresses is immediately enforced when your data is imported.
A default runtime defense rule, *Default - detect suspicious runtime behavior*, logs an alert when a container tries to connect to a banned IP address.

. Review the default rule
+
Go to *Defend > Runtime > {Container Policy | Host Policy}*, then click manage for the *Default - detect suspicious runtime behavior* rule.
You should see that *Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection* is set to *On*.


[.task]
=== Supplementing the malware data feed

You can supplement the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream with your own custom malware signatures.
Update your custom list of malware signatures from the Console UI.
You can specify one entry at a time, or do a bulk upload from a CSV file.
The maximum file size is 20MB.

NOTE: Malware scanning and detection is supported for Linux container images and hosts only.
Windows containers and hosts are not supported.

The first line in your CSV file must be a header record that contains the field names.
For malware data, specify the MD5, followed by the description.
Specify one entry per line.
For example:

  md5,name
  194836fbe0f121a25b145e55e80cef22,evil malware
  0aeb0cac186a81a6ac45776d6b56dd70,evil binary
  33cc273ae3aa8bce6a22c92e7d11f63a,bigevil

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Manage > System > Malware signatures*.

. Click *Upload Malware Data*, and either click *Add* or *Import CSV*.
+
Your custom malware data is used in all subsequent image scans.
It is also used immediately by the runtime defense file system sensor, which assesses all writes to the host and container file system.

[.task]
=== Create a list of trusted executables

If a legitimate binary or a process created from a legitimate binary is incorrectly identified as malicious by any of the runtime detection capabilities, you can add the signature of the binary to a list of trusted executables signatures and ensure that it will not be inspected by any runtime capabilities. 

You can specify one entry at a time, or do a bulk upload from a CSV file.
The maximum file size is 20MB.

NOTE: Malware scanning and detection is supported for Linux container images and hosts only.
Windows containers and hosts are not supported.

The first line in your CSV file must be a header record that contains the field names.
For trusted executables data, specify the MD5, followed by text description that allows you to identify why the MD5 was marked as trusted in the future. 
Specify one entry per line.
For example:

  md5,name
  194836fbe0f121a25b145e55e80cef22,legitimate binary built in house
  0aeb0cac186a81a6ac45776d6b56dd70,test file
  33cc273ae3aa8bce6a22c92e7d11f63a,benign file

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Manage > System > Custom Feeds*.

. Click *Upload Malware Data*, and either click *Add* or *Import CSV*.
+
Your custom malware data is used in all subsequent image scans.
It is also used immediately by the runtime defense file system sensor, which assesses all writes to the host and container file system.

. Review the default rule.
+
A default runtime defense rule, *Default - detect suspicious runtime behavior*, logs an alert when malware is detected using signatures from Prisma Cloud's data set or your custom data set.
+
To review the default rule, go to *Defend > Runtime > {Container Policy | Host Policy}*, then click manage for the *Default - detect suspicious runtime behavior* rule.
You should see that *Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection* is set to *On*.


[.task]
=== Globally allowing CVEs

Some organizations have have very sophisticated CI pipelines that encompass many teams and products.
When a security team concludes that a CVE doesn't impact your organization, they want to dismiss it globally without having to manage individual rules.
Managing exceptions on a per rule basis requires a lot of manual effort.

The CVE Allow List lets you globally allow CVEs system-wide.
Any entry in the CVE Allow List affects all flows in the product, including twistcli, the Jenkins plugin, registry scanning, deployment blocking, Vulnerability Explorer, and so on.
Adding a CVE to this list effectively filters it out from the data in the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream before it's used by the scanner.

The CVE Allow List takes precedence over any rule that's been created under *Defend > Vulnerabilities* menu.
It is a feature designed to complement rules.
Rules also let you allow a CVE, but more granularly, by scoping them to specific resources or parts of your environment.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Manage > System > Custom Feeds*.

. Click *CVE Allow List*, and either click *Add* or *Import CSV*.


=== Test Prisma Cloud's malware detection capabilities

Safely simulate malware in your environment to test Prisma Cloud's malware detection capabilities.


[.task]
==== Configure a custom malware feed

Set up a custom feed by uploading the provided CSV file to Prisma Cloud Console.
This file specifies the MD5 signature for a file that will be considered malware for the purposes of this demo.

[.procedure]
. Download https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/attachments/malware.csv[_malware.csv_].

. In Console, go to *Manage > System > Custom Feeds > Malware Signatures*.

. Click *Import CSV*, and upload _malware.csv_.


[.task]
==== Detect malware at runtime

Test how Prisma Cloud detects malware being downloaded into a container at runtime.

*Prerequisites:*
The default runtime rule, *Default - alert on suspicious runtime behavior* under *Defend > Runtime > Container Policy* is in place.
If you have deleted or changed the default rule, create a new one.

. Go to *Defend > Runtime > Container Policy*, and click *Add rule*.

. Enter a name for the rule.

. In the *General* tab, verify *Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection* is *On*.

. In each of the *Process*, *Networking*, *File System*, and *System Calls* tabs, set *Effect* to *Alert*.

[.procedure]
. Run a container and download malware into it.

  $ docker run -ti alpine sh
  / # wget https://cdn.twistlock.com/docs/attachments/evil

. Look at resulting audit.
Open Console and browse to *Monitor > Events > Container Audits*.
You will see a file system audit that says malware was detected.
