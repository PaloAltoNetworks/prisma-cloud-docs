== Configure Agentless Scanning

Agentless scanning provides visibility into vulnerabilities and compliance risks on hosts.
On Linux VMs, agentless scanning provides insight into whether the Linux Distribution requires security updates to address known vulnerabilities.
This feature also ensures you have visibility into pending operating system security updates.

Under *Manage > Cloud accounts*, you can configure agentless scanning for your AWS, Azure and GCP accounts, manage their credentials in the Cloud Accounts page, and enable other features: cloud discovery, VM tags discovery, and serverless radar.
To setup the agentless scanning for your accounts, you have the following alternatives.

* <<_individual-account,Configure an individual account for scanning.>>
* <<_multiple-accounts,Configure agentless scanning in bulk>>.

Use the *Cloud Account Manager* user role to grant full read and write access to all cloud account settings.
This role can manage credentials, change the agentless scanning configuration, and edit the Cloud Discovery settings.

By default, configured scans are performed every 24 hours, but you can change the scanning interval during configuration under *Manage > System > Scan*. 
Change the agentless scanning interval under *Scheduling > Agentless*

You can check if there are any pending OS security updates for Linux VMs under *Monitor > Compliance > Hosts > VM images*.

To trigger a global scan, click the *Trigger scan* dropdown and select the *Start agentless scan* option on the *Cloud accounts* page.

=== Configure an Individual Account for Scanning

When configuring a single account for agentless scanning, you have all the configuration fields available for that account's provider.
<<_configuration-fields,These fields change from one cloud provider to another>>, and even accounts from the same provider might require different configuration values depending on your use case.
To provide you the most flexibility, you can setup configuration scanning when you add the cloud provider account or change the configuration later.

The following procedure shows the steps needed to configure agentless scanning.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Cloud accounts*

. Click on *Add Account* or click the edit icon for an existing account.

[#_multiple-accounts]
[.task]
=== Configure Multiple Accounts for Scanning

Prisma Cloud supports performing bulk configuration at scale provided you account for the differences between cloud providers.
Different account subtypes require different configuration fields, which also limits your ability to change accounts in bulk.
The Prisma Cloud Console displays all the configuration fields that can be changed across all the selected accounts and hides those that differ to prevent accidental misconfiguration.

The following procedure shows the steps needed to configure agentless scanning for multiple accounts at the same time.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Cloud accounts* 
+
image::manage-cloud-accounts.png[width=800]

. Select multiple accounts.
+
[Note]
====
The best practice is to only configure accounts from the same cloud provider and of the same subtype in bulk.
If you select accounts from different providers, you can't change all configuration fields.
You can only change the configuration fields shared across providers.
You can't change the agentless scanning configuration of accounts with different subtypes in bulk.
====

. Click the *Bulk actions* dropdown.

. Select the *Agentless configuration* button.
+

. Change the configuration values for the selected accounts.

. To complete the configuration, click the *Save* button.

=== Configuration Fields

AWS, Azure, and GCP require different configuration values to enable agentless scanning.
To make enabling the account scanning easier, the Prisma Cloud Console provides default values.
The following sections show the default values and explain any provider-specific requirements.

==== Configuration Fields for AWS Accounts

The Prisma Cloud Console provides the following default configuration values for AWS.

image::agentless-configuration-aws.png[width=800]


==== Configuration Fields for Azure Accounts

The Prisma Cloud Console provides the following default configuration values for Azure.

image::agentless-configuration-azure.png[width=800]

If you don't provide a *Security group ID* or a *Subnet ID*, Prisma Cloud creates them.
If you specify a *Security group ID* or a *Subnet ID*, but they are not present in certain regions Prisma Cloud replicates them in the regions that don't have them.

==== Configuration Fields for GCP Accounts

The Prisma Cloud Console provides the following default configuration values for GCP.

image::agentless-configuration-gcp.png[width=800]

When you download cloud templates for GCP accounts, the download includes the four files GCP requires instead of the three files required by the other providers.
To download the templates, click the *Download templates* icon.
