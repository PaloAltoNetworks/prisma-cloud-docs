== Configure Agentless Scanning

Agentless scanning provides visibility into vulnerabilities and compliance risks on hosts by scanning the root volumes of snapshots.
The agentless scanning architecture lets you inspect a host without having to install an agent or affecting its execution.
To learn more about the architecture and scan results, see xref:../vulnerability_management/agentless_scanning.adoc[agentless scanning].

=== Prerequisites

To configure agentless scanning you must ensure the following requirements are met.

* Ensure you have permissions to create service keys and security groups in your cloud account.
* Ensure you have permissions to apply agentless permission templates to your cloud account.
* Ensure you can connect to the Prisma Cloud Console over HTTPS from your cloud account. If default security group is not available, create custom security group with custom VPC that allows connection for scanners from the account to Prisma Cloud Console.  
* Unless you are using a proxy to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console, you must enable auto-assign public IPs on the subnet or security group you use to connect your cloud account to the Prisma Cloud Console.

To understand what permissions will be needed for agentless scanning, refer to our xref:./permissions.adoc[full permission list].
The downloaded templates from Console add conditions around these permissions to ensure least privileged roles in your accounts.

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
=== Onboard Cloud Account

* Add your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud[AWS, Azure, or GCP account to Prisma Cloud] in *Monitor and Protect* mode.
+
The Monitor and Protect mode has the permission required to enable agentless scanning in your account.

* If you have an existing cloud account that was onboarded to Prisma Cloud:
** Using the *Monitor* mode, you must either update it to use the *Monitor and Protect* mode or manually add the additional permissions required for agentless scanning. See the xref:./permissions.adoc[full permission list].
** Using *Monitor and Protect*, but  was added before June 2022, you must update the Prisma Cloud role to add the permissions required for agentless scanning. See the xref:./permissions.adoc[full permission list].
Note: You can *Download the permission Template* in JSON format from *Compute > Manage > Add Cloud Account > Scan Account*. 

* Verify that you can connect from your cloud account to the Prisma Cloud Console. 
+
Unless you are using a proxy to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console, you must enable auto-assign public IPs on the subnet or security group you use to connect your cloud account to the Prisma Cloud Console.

.. *Auto-scale scanning:* When turned ON, Prisma Cloud automatically scales up / down multiple scanners for faster scans without any user-defined limits. Useful for large scale deployments.

.. *Number of scanners:* Define an upper limit to control the number of scanners Prisma Cloud can automatically spin up in your environment. Depending on the size of your environment, Prisma cloud will scale up / down scanners within the given limit for faster scans. 

.. *Security groups:*

... *AWS:* Security group - If blank, Prisma Cloud uses the _default_ security group to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console. If the _default_ is not available, you must create and specify a custom security group. Otherwise, the connection from your account to the Prisma Cloud Console fails and no scan results are shown.
... *Azure:* Security Group ID and Subnet ID - If blank, a security group and subnet are created automatically to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console. Otherwise, you can specify a custom security group ID and subnet ID.
... *GCP:* Subnet - If blank, Prisma Cloud uses the _default_ subnet in your project to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console. If the _default_ is not available, you must create and specify a custom subnet. Otherwise, the connection from your project to the Prisma Cloud Console fails and no scan results are shown.

=== Configure Agentless Scanning

The following procedure shows the steps required to configure agentless scanning for a cloud account.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Compute > Manage > Cloud accounts*.
+
image::manage-cloud-accounts.png[width=800]

. Click on *Add Account* or click the *Edit* icon of an existing account.

. Select your cloud provider.

.. AWS uses an https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/[access key with a secret key]
.. Azure uses a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli[service principal]
.. GCP uses a https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[service account] and a https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys[service account key].

. If you are adding cloud account credentials, click the *Download* button to download its permission templates. Prisma Cloud validates the specified credentials and the download raises an error if the credentials are incorrect.
To understand more about the downloaded template files and how they are used, refer to the xref:./permissions.adoc[permission templates].

=== Default Configuration Fields

The following list shows the default values for agentless configuration, and those imported from the platform.

. *Console URL and Port:* Automatically imported by the platform
. *Scanning type:* Same Account
. *Scan Scope:* All regions
. *Scan non running hosts:* OFF
. *Auto-scale scanning:* OFF
. *Number of scanners:* 1
. *Security groups:*
.. *AWS:* Prisma Cloud uses the _default_ security group to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console.
.. *Azure:* Prisma Cloud automatically creates a security group to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console.
.. *GCP:* Prisma Cloud uses the _default_ subnet to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console.

You can change default values after importing Cloud Account credentials into Compute using the *Edit* icon for the specific account, or by selecting multiple accounts and clicking on *Bulk actions*.

endif::prisma_cloud[]

=== Pre-flight Checks 

Before scanning, Prisma Cloud performs pre-flight checks and shows any missing permissions.
You can see the status of the credentials without waiting for the scan to fail.
This gives you proactive visibility into errors and missing permissions allowing you to fix them to ensure successful scans.
The following image shows the notification of a missing permission.

*Scan Settings:*
Periodic scans occur every 24 hours by default.
You can change the scan interval under *Manage - System > Scan - Agentless* setting.
You can also perform on-demand scans by clicking the *Agentless scan* button on any of the Monitor pages or by selecting specific accounts under *Manage > Cloud accounts > Scan button* for bulk scanning.

[#_multiple-accounts]
[.task]
=== Bulk Actions

Prisma Cloud supports performing agentless configuration at scale.
Different cloud providers and authentication subtypes require different configuration fields, which also limits your ability to change accounts in bulk.
The Prisma Cloud Console displays all the configuration fields that can be changed across all the selected accounts, and hides those that differ to prevent accidental misconfiguration.

The following procedure shows the steps needed to configure agentless scanning for multiple accounts at the same time.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Cloud accounts*
+
image::manage-cloud-accounts.png[width=800]

. Select multiple accounts.
+
[Note]
====
Only select accounts from the same cloud provider and of the same authentication subtype.
If you select accounts from different providers, you can't change agentless configuration fields.
====

. Click the *Bulk actions* dropdown.

. Select the *Agentless configuration* button.
+
image::bulk-actions.png[width=400]

. Change the configuration values for the selected accounts.
+
image::agentless-configuration-bulk.png[width=800]

* Select *Save* to save the configuration for the selected accounts.

=== Other Settings

Use the *Cloud Account Manager* user role to grant full read and write access to all cloud account settings.
This role can manage credentials, and change *Agentless Scanning* and *Cloud Discovery* configuration.

By default, agentless scans are performed every 24 hours, but you can change the interval on the *Manage > System > Scan* page under *Scheduling > Agentless*.

image::agentless-interval.png[width=800]

To manually trigger an agentless scan, click the *Trigger scan* dropdown and select the *Start agentless scan* option on the *Manage > Cloud accounts* page.
