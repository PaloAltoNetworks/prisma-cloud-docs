== Agentless Permission Templates

Agentless scanning requires specific permissions to work on your self-hosted deployments.
Different platforms have different permission requirements. 
To make applying the right permissions easier, you can download permission templates for your specific platforms.
The following modes are available for agentless scanning in Prisma Cloud.

* *Independent Scanning*: Scan all hosts of a cloud account using the same cloud account. This mode spins up scanners in every scanned account.

* *Hub Account Scanning* Scan all hosts of cloud account (the target account) using a dedicated cloud account (the hub account). This mode spins scanners only in the hub account and not in the target accounts.

The following sections explain the different permission templates and what they entail.

=== AWS

When you click the *Download* button during the permission configuration of AWS cloud accounts, you see three permission templates are downloaded as JSON files.
The templates are needed to enable the different ways accounts are scanned: independent scanning, scan hub account, and target account.

AWS accounts can perform agentless scanning using the following modes.

* Independent scanning
* Hub account scanning

Chose the mode that better suits your needs.

==== Independent Scanning

All scanning happens within the same account.
This account is independent of other accounts.
The account requires all  needed permissions to create snapshots, create scanners, etc. 
To scan accounts using this mode, apply the permission template that ends in `_target_user_permissions.json`.

==== Hub Account Scanning

To use the hub account scanning mode, you must select an account to work as a hub account.
You must grant different permissions to the hub account and to the target accounts.

===== Hub Account Permissions

This account is the hub account where you want all account scanning to happen.
It scans not just the hosts in this account, but it also scans the hosts in other cloud accounts.
This account requires the permissions needed to run Prisma Cloud Scanners and access to all other cloud accounts.
These permissions allow the hub account to see and transfer host snapshots from other accounts to this account. 
To set an account to be the hub account, apply the permission template that ends in  `_hub_user_permissions.json`.

===== Target Account Permissions

This is the account that a hub account scans.
The permissions needed in target accounts are less than those required for independent scanning, but agentless still needs specific permissions to enable the hub account to scan a target account.
Apply the permission template that ends in  `_hub_target_user_permissions.json` to the target accounts to enable the hub account to scan them.


=== Azure

Azure only requires individual account scanning permissions because there is no hub account. Prisma Cloud creates a dedicated PCC resource group, which enables easy cost calculation in the same account scanning. If you don't provide a security group, Prisma Cloud automatically creates one.

=== GCP

When you click the *Download* button during the permission configuration of GCP cloud accounts, you see four permission templates are downloaded as JINJA files. 
Three templates are needed to enable the different ways accounts are scanned: independent scanning, scan hub account, and target account.
A fourth template is needed to enable the hub account to access the target account.

GCP accounts can perform agentless scanning using the following modes.

* Independent scanning
* Hub account scanning

Chose the mode that better suits your needs.

==== Independent Scanning

All scanning happens within the same account.
This account is independent of other accounts.
The account requires all  needed permissions to create snapshots, create scanners, etc. 
The permission template you need to download ends in `_target_user_permissions.yaml.jinja`.

==== Hub Account Scanning

To use the hub account scanning mode, you must select an account to work as a hub account.
You must grant different permissions to the hub account and to the target accounts.

===== Hub Account Permissions

This account is the hub account where you want all account scanning to happen.
It scans not just the hosts in this account, but it also scans the hosts in other cloud accounts.
This account requires the permissions needed to run Prisma Cloud Scanners and to access to all other cloud accounts.
These permissions allow the hub account to see and transfer host snapshots from other accounts to this account. 
To set an account to be the hub account, apply the permission template that ends in `_hub_user_permissions.yaml.jinja`.

===== Target Account Permissions

This is the account that a hub account scans.
The permissions needed in target accounts are less than those required for independent scanning, but agentless still needs specific permissions to enable the hub account to scan a target account.
Apply the permission template that ends in `_hub_target_user_permissions.yaml.jinja` to the target accounts to enable the hub account to scan them.

In GCP, snapshots are created in the hub account. Therefore, the hub account needs additional permissions in the target account. 
You must apply an additional  template in the target account to grant the hub account this additional permission.
The permission template you must apply ends in `_hub_target_access_permissions.yaml.jinja`.
