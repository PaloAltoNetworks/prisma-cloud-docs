== Tags

Tags are predefined labels that can help you manage the vulnerabilities in your environment.
They are centrally defined and can be set to vulnerabilities and as policy exceptions.

Tags are used as:

* Vulnerability labels.
They provide a convenient way to categorize the vulnerabilities in your environment.
* Policy exceptions.
They can be a part of your rules in order to have a specific effect on tagged vulnerabilities.

Tags are useful when you have large container deployments with multiple teams working in the same environment. For example, you might have different teams handling different types of vulnerabilities. Then you can set tags in order to define responsibilities over vulnerabilities. Other uses would be to set the status of fixing the vulnerability, or to mark vulnerabilities to ignore when they are a known problem that can't be fixed in the near future.

=== Tag definition

You can define as many tags as you like.

[.procedure]
. To define a new tag, navigate to *Manage > Collections and Tags > Tags*.
+
Prisma Cloud ships with a predefined set of tags: Ignored, In progress, For review, DevOps notes. The predefined tags are editable and you can use them according to your needs.

. Click *Add Tag*.

. In the *Create new tag* dialog, enter a name and description. 

. Pick a color for easy visibility and differentiation.

=== Tag assignment

You can assign tags to vulnerabilities, and specify their scope based on CVE ID, packages and resources. Alternatively, you can manually tag vulnerabilities from xref:../vulnerability_management/scan_reports.adoc[scan reports].

Note that a tag assignment is uniquely identified by tag, CVE ID, package scope and resource type, therefore, you can not create multiple tag assignments for the same tag, CVE ID, package scope and resource type. To extend the scope of a tag applied to a CVE, edit its existing tag assignment to apply to more packages or resources.

For example, assign the tag _Ignored_ to _CVE-2020-1971_, package _openssl_, and all _ubuntu_ images as follows:

image::tags_add_tag_assignment.png[width=600]

You can also adjust the scope of a tag assigned either from the tags management page or from scan reports. Click the *Edit* button to start editing the tag assignment. For example, extend the scope of the tag _Ignored_ for _CVE-2020-1971_ to all packages affected by this CVE by changing the *Package scope*:

image::tags_edit_tag_assignment.png[width=600]

As another example, after the _In progress_ tag was assgined to _CVE-2019-14697_ for specific _alpine_ images from the scan reports, you can extend its scope so it will apply to all _alpine_ images and their descendant images:

image::tags_assigned_from_scan_reports.png[width=800]

image::tags_specific_images.png[width=600]

image::tags_images_with_wildcard.png[width=600]

To easily navigate in multiple tag assignments, use the table filters on the *Tag assignment* table. Filter by CVE ID, tag, package scope, and resource type to quickly find all places a tag applies to.

[.procedure]
. To assign tag to vulnerability, navigate to *Manage > Collections and Tags > Tags*.

. Click *Assign Tag*.

. In *Tag*, select the tag to assign.

. In *CVE*, select the CVE ID to assign the tag for.

. In *Package scope*, select the package to which the tag should apply. You can select *All packages* to apply the tag to all the packages affected by the CVE.

. In *Resource type*, select the type of resources to assign the tag for. You can select *All resources* to apply the tag to all the resources across your environment.
+
NOTE: VMware Tanzu droplets and running applications are being referenced as *Images*.

. Once resource type is selected, specify the resources to which the tag should apply under *Images*, *Hosts*, *Functions*, or *Code repositories*. Wildcards are supported.

. (Optional) For images, turn on the *Tag descendant images* toggle to let Prisma Cloud automatically tag this CVE in all images where the base image is one of the images specified in the *Images* field.
+ 
For Prisma Cloud to be able to tag descendant images, first identify the xref:../vulnerability_management/base_images.adoc[base images] in your environment under *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Base images*. 

. (Optional) In *Comment*, specify a comment for this tag assignment.

. Click *Save*.
