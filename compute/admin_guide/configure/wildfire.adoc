== WildFire Settings

WildFire is Palo Alto Networks' malware detection engine, and it provides malware detection for both known and unknown threats.

Wildfire analysis is provided without additional costs, but this may change in future releases.
The service is available in Prisma Cloud for malware analysis as part of containers Continuous Integration (CI) and as runtime protection for containers and hosts.
Access to WildFire is provided as a new subscription that is specific to Prisma Cloud Compute, and doesn't affect any existing WildFire subscriptions.

To check a file verdict, the file hash is calculated and sent to WildFire for a verdict.
If a file with the specified hash was already uploaded for a verdict, Wildfire provides an instantaneous verdict.
You can send unknown files to WildFire for a full analysis, which includes machine based static analysis, dynamic analysis with detonation of the file in a sandbox, and behavioral analysis.

WildFire supports the following verdict types: benign, malware, grayware, and unknown:

* *Benign:* The sample is safe and doesn't exhibit malicious behavior.

* *Grayware:* The sample doesn't pose a direct security threat, but might display otherwise obtrusive behavior. Grayware typically includes:
** Adware
** Spyware
** Browser Helper Objects (BHOs).

* *Malicious:* The sample is malware and poses a security threat. Malware can include:
** Viruses
** Worms
** Trojans
** Remote Access Tools (RATs)
** Rootkits
** Botnets

* *Unknown:* The file hasn't been uploaded previously to Wildfire for analysis.
Full analysis can be performed on file upload.

Configuration of the WildFire malware analysis service is done via *Manage > System > WildFire*.

* *Wildfire malware detection:* Enable WildFire malware detection.

* *Status:* Shows the current activation state of WildFire. The status is updated upon successful activation of the Wildfire service.

* *WildFire cloud region:* The WildFire service is available in multiple locations to meet local privacy requirements and reduce latency for communication to the service.

All Defenders connected to a given Prisma Cloud Console must use the same Wildfire service.
This WildFire service is used for file verdicts and to upload files for full analysis.
You should select the WildFire service closest to where most defenders are, or based on your privacy requirements.
Defenders must be able to access the relevant WildFire service configured over https (port 443) based on the following URLs:

* Global (US): wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com
* Australia: au.wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com
* Canada: ca.wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com
* Europe (Netherlands): eu.wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com
* Japan: jp.wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com
* Singapore: sg.wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com
* United Kingdom: uk.wildfire.paloaltonetworks.com

For WildFire activation and license renewals, the Prisma Cloud Console must be able to access the Intelligence Stream (IS) server at https://intelligence.twistlock.com.

* *Use WildFire for runtime protection:* Enable WildFire malware scanning in runtime for containers and hosts.
Go to the rule's *Anti-malware* tab, to configure the preferred effects per rule.

* *Use WildFire for CI compliance checks:* Enable WildFire malware scanning for containers CI checks.
WildFire scans malware as part of Twistlock labs image check (ID 422).

* *Upload files with unknown verdicts to WildFire:* Determine whether files with unknown verdict are sent to WildFire for full analysis.
When disabled, WildFire only provides verdicts for files that have been uploaded to WildFire via a different client.

* *Treat grayware as malware:* Use a more restrictive approach and treat files with grayware verdict as malware.

Currently Prisma Cloud Compute uses WildFire for file verdicts only in the following scenarios:

* Hosts runtime: 

** ELF files written to a Linux host file system in runtime, which are not deployed via a package manager.
** Files must be smaller than 100MB due to the size limit of WildFire.

* Container runtime and CI:
** ELF files written to a Linux container file system in runtime. Malware analysis not supported for other file types.
+
During CI scanning, WildFire analyses only executable files that were not written as part of a package installation.
** WildFire doesn't scan shared objects.
** File must be smaller than 100MB due to the size limit of WildFire.

[NOTE]
====
* You can submit up to 5000 files per day, and get up to 50,000 verdicts on your submissions to the WildFire service.
* Wildfire is supported on Linux only.
+
*Windows containers and hosts aren't currently supported.*
