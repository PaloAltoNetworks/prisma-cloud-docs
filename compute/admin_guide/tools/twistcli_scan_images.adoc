== Scan Images with `twistcli`

You can use the Prisma Cloud `twistcli` command-line tool to scan container images and serverless functions.
Scanning with `twistcli` is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

=== Command

The `twistcli` command-line tool has several subcommands.
To scan, use the following subcommand.

[source,bash]
----
twistcli images scan
----

The command scans an image for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
The image must be on the system running the `twistcli` command-line tool.
If not and if you are using Docker, you can retrieve the image with the `docker pull` before scanning it.
The `twistcli` tool does not pull images.

==== Syntax

When using `twistcli images scan`, the image or tarball to scan must be the last parameter.
If you specify options after the image or tarball, they are ignored.
If scanning a tarball, use the `--tarball` option.

[source,bash]
----
twistcli images scan [OPTIONS] [IMAGE]
----

==== Description

The `twistcli images scan` tool collects information about the packages and binaries in the container image, and sends the information to the Prisma Cloud Console for analysis.

The `twistcli` tool collects data including the following items.

* Packages in the image.
* Files installed by each package.
* Hashes for files in the image.

After the Prisma Cloud Console analyzes the image for vulnerabilities, `twistcli` performs the following tasks.

* Outputs a summary report.
* Exits with a pass or fail return value.

To specify an image to scan, use either the image ID, or repository name and tag.
If you are using Windows with `containerd`, provide a full image ID because short IDs aren't supported.
Get the full image ID using the following command.

[source]
----
ctr -n <namespace> images ls
----

The image should be present on the system, having either been built or pulled there.
If a repository is specified without a tag, `twistcli` looks for an image tagged `latest`.

==== Options

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
`--address` [.underline]#`URL`#::
Required.
URL for Console, including the protocol and port.
Only the HTTPS protocol is supported.
To get the address for your Console, go to *Compute > Manage > System > Utilities*, and copy the string under *Path to Console*.
+
Example: --address \https://us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-3-123456789

`-u`, `--user` [.underline]#`Access Key ID`#::
Access Key ID to access Prisma Cloud. 
If not provided, the `TWISTLOCK_USER` environment variable is used, if defined.
Otherwise, "admin" is used as the default.

`-p`, `--password` [.underline]#`Secret Key`#::
Secret Key for the above Access Key ID specified with `-u`, `--user`.
If not specified on the command-line, the `TWISTLOCK_PASSWORD` environment variable is used, if defined.
Otherwise, you will be prompted for the user's password before the scan runs.

Access Key ID and Secret Key are generated from the Prisma Cloud user interface.
For more information, see xref:../authentication/access_keys.adoc[access keys]

endif::prisma_cloud[]


ifdef::compute_edition[]
* *`--address URL`*
+
Complete URL for Console, including the protocol and port.
Only the HTTPS protocol is supported.
By default, Console listens to HTTPS on port 8083, although your administrator can configure Console to listen on a different port.
Defaults to \https://127.0.0.1:8083.
+
Example: --address \https://console.example.com:8083

* *`-u`, `--user USERNAME`*
+
Username to access Console.  If not provided, the `TWISTLOCK_USER` environment variable will be used if defined, or "admin" is used as the default.

* *`-p`, `--password PASSWORD`*
+
Password for the user specified with `-u`, `--user`.
If not specified on the command-line, the `TWISTLOCK_PASSWORD` environment variable will be used if defined, or otherwise will prompt for the user's password before the scan runs.

* *`--project PROJECT NAME`*
+
Interface with a specific supervisor Console to retrieve policy and publish results.
+
Example: `--project "Tenant Console"`
endif::compute_edition[]

* *`--output-file FILENAME`*
+
Write the results of the scan to a file in JSON format.
+
Example: `--output-file scan-results.json`

* *`--details`*
+
Show all vulnerability details.

* *`--containerized`*
+
Run the scan from inside the container.

* *`--custom-labels`*
+
Include the image custom labels in the results.

* *`--docker-address DOCKER_CLIENT_ADDRESS`*
+
Docker daemon listening address (default: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`).
Can be specified with the `DOCKER_CLIENT_ADDRESS` environment variable.

* *`--docker-tlscacert PATH`*
+
Path to Docker client CA certificate.

* *`--docker-tlscert PATH`*
+
Path to Docker client Client certificate.

* *`--docker-tlskey PATH`*
+
Path to Docker client Client private key.

* *`--exit-on-error TRUE/FALSE`*
+
Immediately exit the scan if an error is encountered (not supported with the --containerized flag).

* *`--tlscacert PATH`*
+
Path to Prisma Cloud CA certificate file.
If no CA certificate is specified, the connection to Console is insecure.

* *`--podman-path PATH`*
+
Forces twistcli to use Podman.
To use the default installation path, set as `podman`.
Otherwise, provide the appropriate path.

* *`--include-js-dependencies`*
+
Evaluates packages listed only in manifests.

* *`--token TOKEN`*
+
Token to use for Prisma Cloud Console authentication.
Tokens can be retrieved from the API endpoint `api/v1/authenticate` or from the *Manage > System > Utilities* page in Console.

* *`--publish TRUE/FALSE`*
+
Publishes scan results to the Console (default: --publish=true)

* *`--tarball`*
+
Boolean flag that specifies the image to scan is a tar archive. 
The tarball scan requires enhanced privileges, and must be executed as sudo or as a root user.
Prisma Cloud supports tar archives in the https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/00d8a3bb516ad1e14c56ccdfeb70736bbeb0ba49/image/spec[Docker Image Specification] format, v1.1 and later.

The `tarball` option is supported on Linux only; macOS and Windows versions of twistcli do not support it.

The last parameter in the twistcli command should always be the path to the tarball.
The `--tarball` option is simply a boolean flag.
It doesn't accept a corresponding value (e.g. a path to a tarball).
For clarity, see the following examples:

Correct usage:
----
  ./twistcli images scan --tarball --user ted image.tar
----
Incorrect usage:
----
  ./twistcli images scan --tarball image.tar --user ted
----

==== Return value

The exit code is 0 if `twistcli images scan` finds no vulnerabilities or compliance issues.
Otherwise, the exit code is 1.

The criteria for passing or failing a scan is determined by the CI vulnerability and compliance policies set in Console.
The default CI vulnerability policy alerts on all CVEs detected.
The default CI compliance policy alerts on all critical and high compliance issues.


[NOTE]
====
There are a couple of reasons why `twistcli images scan` might return an exit code of 1.

* The scan failed because the scanner found issues that violate your CI policy.
* Twistcli failed to run due to an error.

Although the return value is ambiguous -- you cannot determine the exact reason for the failure by just examining the return value -- this setup supports automation.
From an automation process perspective, you expect that the entire flow will work.
If you scan an image, with or without a threshold, either it works or it does not work.
If it fails, for whatever reason, you want to fail everything because there is a problem.
====


=== Scan Results

To view scan reports in Console, go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > CI* or *Monitor > Compliance > Images > CI*.

The scan reports includes the image vulnerabilities, compliance issues, layers, process info, package info, and labels.

When scanning images in the CI pipeline with twistcli or the xref:../continuous_integration/jenkins_plugin.adoc[Jenkins plugin], Prisma Cloud collects the environment variable `JOB_NAME` from the machine the scan ran on, and adds it as a label to the scan report.

You can also retrieve scan reports in JSON format using the Prisma Cloud API, see the <<_api, API>> section.


==== Output

The twistcli tool can output scan results to several places:

* stdout.
* JSON file.
* Console.
Scan results can be viewed under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > CI* and *Monitor > Compliance > Images > CI*.

By passing certain flags, you can adjust how the twistcli scan output looks and where it goes.
By default, twistcli writes scan results to stdout and sends the results to Console.

To write scan results to stdout in tabular format, pass the `--details` flag to twistcli.
This does not affect where the results are sent.

To write scan results to a file in JSON format, pass the `--output-file` flag to twistcli. The file schema is being kept for backwards compatibility.

=== Projects

When users from a tenant project run twistcli, they must set the `--project` option to specify the proper context for the command.

`twistcli images scan --project "<project_name>"`


[#_api]
==== API

You can retrieve scan reports in JSON format using the Prisma Cloud Compute API.
The API returns comprehensive information for each scan report, including the full list of packages, files, and vulnerabilities.

The following example `curl` command calls the API with Basic authentication.
You'll need to apply some filtering with tools like `jq` to extract specific items from the response.
For more information on accessing the API, see the https://pan.dev/compute/api/[API reference].

----
$ curl \
  -u <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  -o scan_results.json \
  'https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/scans?type=ciImage'
----

If you are using assigned collections, then specify the collection in a query parameter:

----
$ curl \
  -u <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  -o scan_results.json \
  'https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/scans?type=ciImage&collections=<COLLECTION_NAME>'
----


=== Dockerless Scan

By default, twistcli is run from outside the container image.


==== Podman Twistcli Scans

Twistcli can run scans on Podman hosts.
Use `--podman-path PATH` to specify the path to podman and force the twistcli scanner to use podman.
For additional information, see the <<_podman, Podman>> section.


==== Running from inside of the container

In some cases, you might need to copy twistcli to the container's file system, and then run the scanner from inside the container.

One reason you might want to run the scanner this way is when your build platform doesn't give you access to the Docker socket.
CodeFresh is an example of such a platform.

There are some shortcomings with scanning from inside a container, so you should only use this approach when no other approach is viable.
The shortcomings are:

* Automating the scan in your continuous integration pipeline is more difficult.

* Image metadata, such as registry, repository, and tag aren't available in the scan report.
When twistcli is run from outside the container, this information is retrieved from the Docker API.

* The image ID isn't available in the scan report because it cannot be determined when the scan is run from inside a container.

* The scan report won't show a layer-by-layer analysis of the image.

NOTE: To run a `twistcli` image scan within a container and without passing the `--containerized` flag, you need to run the container as a privileged container.

===== Usage

When running the scanner from inside a container, you need to properly orient it by passing it the `--containerized` flag.
There are a couple of ways to run twistcli with the `--containerized` flag: build-time and run-time.

For security reasons, Prisma Cloud recommends that you create a user with the _CI User_ xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] for running scans.


===== Build-time Invocation

After building an image, run it.
Mount the host directory that holds the twistcli binary, pass the Prisma Cloud Console user credentials to the container with environment variables, then run the scanner inside the container.
The `<REPORT_ID>` is a user defined string that uniquely identifies the scan report in the Console UI.

----
$ docker run \
  -v /PATH/TO/TWISTCLIDIR:/tools \
  -e TW_USER=<COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  -e TW_PASS=<COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
  -e TW_CONSOLE=<COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --entrypoint="" \
  <IMAGE_NAME> \
  /tools/twistcli images scan \
    --containerized \
    --details \
    --address $TW_CONSOLE \
    --user $TW_USER \
    --password $TW_PASS \
    <REPORT_ID>
----

Rather than username and password, twistcli can also authenticate to Console with a token.
Your API token can be found in Console under *Manage > System > Utilities > API token*.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
For security reasons, API xref:../configure/logon_settings.adoc[tokens expire].
endif::compute_edition[]

----
$ docker run \
  -v /PATH/TO/TWISTCLI_DIR:/tools \
  -e TW_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN> \
  -e TW_CONSOLE=<COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --entrypoint="" \
  <IMAGE_NAME> \
  /tools/twistcli images scan \
    --containerized \
    --details \
    --address $TW_CONSOLE \
    --token $TW_TOKEN \
    <REPORT_ID>
----

===== Run-time Invocation

If you have access to the orchestrator, you can exec into the running container to run the twistcli scanner.
Alternatively, you could SSH to the container.
Once you have a shell on the running container, invoke the scanner:

----
$ ./twistcli images scan \
  --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --user <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  --password <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
  --containerized \
  <REPORT_ID>
----

To invoke the scanner with an API token:

----
$ ./twistcli images scan \
  --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --token <API_TOKEN> \
  --containerized \
  <REPORT_ID>
----

[.task]
=== Simple Scan

Scan an image with twistcli and print the summary report to stdout.

[.procedure]
. Scan an image named `nginx:latest`.
+
----
$ twistcli images scan \
  --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --user <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  --password <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
  nginx:latest
----
+
Command output:
+
image::simple_scan.png[scale=15]


[.task]
=== Scan with Detailed Report

You can have twistcli generate a detailed report for each scan.
The following procedure shows you how to scan an image with twistcli, and then retrieve the results from Console.

[.procedure]
. Scan an image named `nginx:latest`.
+
----
$ twistcli images scan \
  --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --user <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  --password <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
  --details \
  nginx:latest
----
+
Sample command output (results have been truncated):
+
image::detailed_scan.png[scale=15]

. This outputs a tabular representation of your scan results to stdout.
If you need to retrieve the results of your scan in JSON format, this can be done using the API.
For more information on the API, see the https://pan.dev/compute/api/[API reference].

.. Call the API with authentication (demonstrated here using Basic authentication) to fetch the results of the scan.
+
----
$ curl \
  -o scan_results.json \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic YXBpOmFwaQ==' \
  'https://<COMPUTE_CONSOLE>/api/v1/scans?search=myimage&limit=1&reverse=true&type=ciImage'
----
.. Format the scan results into human-readable format.
+
----
$ python -m json.tool scan_results.json > scan_results_pp.json
----
.. Inspect the results.
+
Open `scan_results_pp.json` to view the results. Vulnerability information can be found in the `vulnerabilities` array, and compliance results can be found in the `complianceIssues` array.
+

=== Scan Images Built with Jenkins in an OpenShift Environment

// For help understanding the Jenkins infrastructure on OCP, see:
// https://blog.openshift.com/jenkins-slaves-in-openshift-using-an-external-jenkins-environment/
// http://blog.andyserver.com/2016/01/jenkins-cluster-openshift/
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/using_images/other_images/jenkins.html#using-images-other-images-jenkins

If you are building and deploying images on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), and you are utilizing their Jenkins infrastructure, then invoke a scan with the `twistcli hosts scan` command, not the `twistcli images scan` command.

You can scan images generated by Jenkins with the OpenShift plugin by invoking twistcli from a
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/dev_guide/builds/build_hooks.html[build hook].
Build hooks let you inject custom logic into the build process.
They run your commands inside a temporary container instantiated from build output image.
Build hooks are called when the last layer of the image has been committed, but before the image is pushed to a registry.
An non-zero exit code fails the build.
A zero exit code passes the build, and allows it to proceed to the next step.

To call twistcli from a build hook:

[.procedure]
. Download twistcli into your build environment.
Depending on your build strategy, one option is to download it as an https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.html#using-external-artifacts[external artifact] using a `save-artifacts` https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts[S2I script].

. In your `BuildConfig`, call twistcli as a `script` from the `postCommit` hook.
+
----
$ twistcli hosts scan \
  --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --user <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  --password <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
  --skip-docker \
  --include-3rd-party
----
+
Where the `--skip-docker` option skips all Docker compliance checks such as the Docker daemon configuration and the `--include-3rd-party` option scans application-specific files such as JARs.


=== Scan Images when the Docker Docket Isn't in the Default Location

The twistcli scanner uses the Docker API, so it must be able to access the socket where the Docker daemon listens.
If your Docker socket isn't in the default location, use the `--docker-address` option to tell twistcli where to find it:

`--docker-address` [.underline]#`PATH`#::
Path to the Docker socket.
By default, twistcli looks for the Docker socket `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.

----
$ ./twistcli images scan \
  --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
  --user <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
  --password <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
  --docker-address unix:///<PATH/TO>/docker.sock \
  <IMAGE_NAME>
----


[#_podman]
=== Scan Podman/CRI Images

Podman is a daemon-less container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers on Linux.
The twistcli tool can use the preinstalled Podman binary to scan CRI images.
//https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/PCSUP-8724 and https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/PCSUP-10502)
NOTE: To run a `twistcli` image scan within a container using podman and without passing the `--containerized` flag, you need to run the container as a privileged container.

`--podman-path` [.underline]#`PATH`#::
Forces twistcli to use Podman.
To call podman from its default install path, specify `podman`.
Otherwise, specify an explicit path.
    
  $ ./twistcli images scan \
    --address <COMPUTE_CONSOLE> \
    --user <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_USER> \
    --password <COMPUTE_CONSOLE_PASSWD> \
    --podman-path podman \
    <IMAGE_NAME>

=== CI/CD Automation

Twistcli images scan can be used to shift-left security scans inside of your build pipeline.
Plugins are available for Jenkins and other CI/CD tools, but twistcli can also be used from a CI pipeline in order to initiate vulnerability and compliance scans on images.

The exit status code can be verified inside of your pipeline to determine pass and fail status of the image scan.
A zero exit code signals the scan passes, and any non-zero exit code signals a failure.  

In order to automate the download and version sync of twistcli, reference the sample Jenkins code below:

----
stage('Check twistcli version') {

  def TCLI_VERSION = sh(script: "./twistcli | grep -A1 VERSION | sed 1d", returnStdout:true).trim()
  def CONSOLE_VERSION = sh(script: "curl -k -u \"$TL_USER:$TL_PASS\" https://$TL_CONSOLE/api/v1/version | tr -d \'\"'", returnStdout:true).trim()

  println "TCLI_VERSION = $TCLI_VERSION"
  println "CONSOLE_VERSION = $CONSOLE_VERSION"

  if ("$TCLI_VERSION" != "$CONSOLE_VERSION") {
    println "downloading twistcli"
    sh 'curl -k -u $TL_USER:$TL_PASS --output ./twistcli https://$TL_CONSOLE/api/v1/util/twistcli'
    sh 'sudo chmod a+x ./twistcli'
  }
}

stage('Scan with Twistcli') {
  sh './twistcli images scan --address https://$TL_CONSOLE -u $TL_USER -p $TL_PASS --details $IMAGE'
}
----

[.task]
=== Using twistcli with Prisma Cloud Compute in Enterprise Edition

The following procedure is true even if IP whitelisting feature is enabled in Prisma Cloud.
You can use your username:password from PC or Access Key / Secret Key created by a user as username:password in twistcli calls.

[.procedure]
. Go to Settings > Access Keys page under Prisma Cloud

. Create an Access Key with desired expiration time. Make sure you keep this secure by downloading or copying for future use.   

. Get Compute Console URL from Compute tab - Manage > System > Utilities.

. Use Access Key as username and Secret key as password for your twistcli calls

./twistcli images scan --address <Console> --username <ACCESS_KEY> --password <SECRET_KEY> ubuntu:latest

=== Scan Image Tarballs

`twistcli` can scan image tarballs.
This capability is designed to support the following  workflows:

* Integration with Kaniko.
Kaniko is a tool that builds images in a Kubernetes cluster from a Dockerfile without access to a Docker daemon.
* Vendors deliver container images as tar files, not through a registry.

twistcli supports the https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/00d8a3bb516ad1e14c56ccdfeb70736bbeb0ba49/image/spec[Docker Image Specification] v1.1 and later.
Currently, twistcli doesn't support the Open Container Initiative (OCI) https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md[Image Format Specification].

Both Kaniko and the `docker save` command output tarballs using the Docker Image Specification.

To scan an image tarball, specify the `--tarball` option:

  twistcli images scan --tarball <image_tarball>

For example:

  docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa:1.9
  docker save vulnerables/web-dvwa:1.9 | gzip > vulnerables_web_dvwa19.tar.gz
  twistcli images scan --tarball vulnerables_web_dvwa19.tar.gz

NOTE:
To scan image tarballs in an unprivileged container, pass the following capabilities: CAP_SYS_CHROOT and CAP_MKNOD.

=== Scan Windows images on Windows hosts with containerd

You can use twistcli to scan Windows images on Windows hosts with containerd installed.

  .\twistcli.exe images scan \
  --address <CONSOLE_URL> \
  -u <USER> \
  --containerd \
  --containerd-namespace <NAMESPACE>
  <IMAGE_ID | IMAGE_NAME>

[NOTE]
====
// twistlock/twistlock#37836
The image ID passed to `twistcli` must be the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/#list-the-full-length-image-ids[full length image ID].
Short IDs aren't supported.
Get full length image IDs using the following command.

[source,bash]
----
ctr -n <namespace> images ls
----

https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases[Download] the https://github.com/projectatomic/containerd/blob/master/docs/cli.md[ctr] utility.

Windows requires the host OS version to match the container OS version.
If you want to run a container based on a newer Windows build, make sure you have an equivalent host build.
Otherwise, you can use Hyper-V isolation to run older containers on new host builds.
For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility?tabs=windows-server-2022%2Cwindows-11-21H2[Windows containers version compatibility].
====

=== Limitations

// twistlock/twistlock#37074
Due to a https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko/issues/699[bug] in Kaniko, twistcli can't map vulnerabilities to layers when scanning image tarballs built by Kaniko.
