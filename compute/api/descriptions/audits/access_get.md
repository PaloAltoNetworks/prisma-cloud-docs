Retrieves all access audits.
Prisma Cloud Compute records access audits every time a Docker Engine or Kubernetes command is run on a host protected by Defender.
You can also configure Prisma Cloud Compute to record audits for any sudo or SSH commands that are executed on hosts protected Defender.

The following example command gives a list of ALL access audits.

```bash
$ curl -k \
  -u <USER> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X GET \
  https://console:8083/api/v1/audits/access
```

To get just the docker audits run it with type=docker parameter. 

```bash
$ curl -k \
  -u <USER> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X GET \
  https://console:8083/api/v1/audits/access?type=docker

```
