== Log Files

Prisma Cloud writes to RFC compliant syslog, this syslog data can be
injected by any number of time series data solutions as well as common
SIEM solutions. Prisma Cloud offers a few layers of detail in our syslog
messages which you can select to increase the verbosity of the messages.
Prisma Cloud recommends leaving the messages at their defaults and it can also write to STDOUT as well as feed into Prometheus. For more
information see our logging documentation for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/audit/logging[Enterprise Edition] or https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-06/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/audit/logging[Compute edition].
