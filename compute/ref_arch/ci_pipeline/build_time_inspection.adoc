== Build-time Inspection

Prisma Cloud CI integration enables automatic scans of your custom Docker
images at build time. Scans can detect vulnerabilities and compliance
issues before your images are pushed to the registry and deployed into
production. Thresholds can be specified to fail builds of images that
have issues that exceed a specified severity.

The results of the scans via Jenkins or twistcli are available in the
Console.
