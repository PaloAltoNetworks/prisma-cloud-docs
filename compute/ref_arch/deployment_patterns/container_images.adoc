== Prisma Cloud Container Images

You can either download and manage all Prisma Cloud container images by
yourself or you can access them from our hosted registry.

When you download our software from the Palo Alto Networks
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-guide-compute/welcome/releases.html[Customer Support Portal (CSP)],
you get a tarball that can be used to install Prisma Cloud. You can also
pull the images from the Prisma Cloud Registry, for more information see
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-guide-compute/install/twistlock_container_images.html[here].

You can push the Prisma Cloud images to your own private registry, and
manage them as you see fit. The Console image is delivered as a .tar.gz
file in the release tarball. After Console is installed, the Defender
image is accessible from the dashboard under Manage \> Defenders \>
Deploy, where deployment scripts retrieve the Defender image from
Console using the /api/v1/images/twistlock\_defender.tar.gz API
endpoint.

You can also retrieve Prisma Cloud images from our hosted registry, which
is available to all current customers with a valid access token. This
option simplifies a lot of workflows, especially the initial install
flow.
