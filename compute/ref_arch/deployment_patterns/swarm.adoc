== Prisma Cloud on Docker Swarm

Prisma Cloud supports installation on Docker Swarm using Swarm-native
features. You deploy Console as a service with the number of replicas
limited to 1 and rely on Swarm to provide built-in high availability.
You also deploy Defender as a global service. The global service
guarantees that Defender is automatically deployed to each worker node
in the cluster.

The diagram below illustrates a basic Prisma Cloud deployment on Docker
Swarm:

=== Notes on Deploying Console in Swarm:

You'll use the twistcli tool provided in the install package to install
Console, which will push the console image to your registry. Console
uses Swarm's routing mesh networking, so the Console service is
available on the target port on every node. More detail on installing
Console in Swarm can be found
