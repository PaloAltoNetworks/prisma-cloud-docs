== Automating Prisma Cloud Installs for Other Environments

To enable deployment across environments we host our Prisma Cloud images in
a repository designed for reliability and availability. This repository
is accessible using your Access Token supplied as part of your license.
More information on accessing our hosted registry is available
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-guide-compute/install/twistlock_container_images.html[here].

Details on deployment will vary according to the environment but the
high level steps are much like the other deployments above.

The Console image can be pulled from Prisma Cloud. It can be started on
your platform with persistent storage, appropriate [*network
connectivity*](#_orv6kpdgllhm) and configured using the Web UI.

The Console is also available as a SaaS deployment as part of your Prisma Cloud subscription.

Defender deployments will vary but as the Defender is usually pulled
from the Console it's as simple as calling the API. Detailed
instructions can be found
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-guide-compute/install/defender_types.html[here].
