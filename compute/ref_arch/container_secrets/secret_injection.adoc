== Secrets Injection

Prisma Cloud can be configured to retrieve secrets from your secrets store
and inject them into the containers that need them. Prisma Cloud supports a
variety of secrets stores:

- AWS Systems Parameter Store
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault
- Hashicorp Vault

Prisma Cloud securely retrieves secrets from your designated secrets store
and can inject them as either environment variables or files into the
containers you designate. Prisma Cloud provides a granular rule-driven
system for defining how and where secrets are injected. To protect your
secrets, configure your rules restrictively, using the principle of
least-privilege access. For more information about configuring Prisma Cloud
to perform secrets injection, see this
