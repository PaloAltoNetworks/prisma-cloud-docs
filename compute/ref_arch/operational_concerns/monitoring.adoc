== Monitoring

Prisma Cloud provides API endpoints to monitor the health and availability
of deployed components.

We recommend you monitor the following aspects of your Prisma Cloud
installation:

*Console Service Availability:*

Monitor the Prisma Cloud API and ensure the ping API returns "200 ok"

- API endpoint: GET /api/v1/_ping
- Example command: curl -u admin:Password
    'https:\<console-ip\>:8083/api/v1/_ping

*Intelligence Stream Connectivity:*

The Intelligence Stream is used to pull down threat and CVE data. From
the Console or host, monitor the following:

- https://intelligence.twistlock.com/api/v1/_ping

*Disk Space:*

Console writes files to disk both database and logging. We recommend
customers monitor the health and space available on the volume that
contains /var/lib/twistlock. Typical customers with normal usage should
raise an alert when 20 GB or less of disk space is available on the
volume. This location can be modified in twistlock.cfg at install time.

Both Console and Defender containers are configured with Docker Health
Check, a best practice, which gives you insight into the containers'
health.
