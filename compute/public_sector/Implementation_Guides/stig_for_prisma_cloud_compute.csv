A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.

The application must be configured to automatically provide account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. The automated mechanisms may reside within the application itself or may be offered by the operating system or other infrastructure-providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies, that when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

Account management functions include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; or using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.","User identity and role based access is critical for the confidentiality and integrity of the system.

If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication.

Examples of situations where a user ID and password might be used include:

- When the user does not use a CAC and is not a current DoD employee, member of the military, or DoD contractor.

- When a user has been officially designated as temporarily unable to present a CAC for some reason (lost, damaged, not yet issued, broken card reader) (i.e., Temporary Exception User) and to satisfy urgent organizational needs must be temporarily permitted to use user ID/password authentication until the problem with CAC use has been remedied.

- When the application is publicly available and or hosting publicly releasable data requiring some degree of need-to-know protection.

If the password is already encrypted and not a plaintext password, this meets this requirement. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password. Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one-way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security.

Verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. A more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random salt value as follows:

H0 = H(pwd, H(salt))
Hn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))

In the above, ""n"" is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. ""Hn"" is stored along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares ""Hn"" with the stored ""Hn"". A salt is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically strong random value.

Another method is using a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key.

Not updating the container platform and container images will expose the organization to vulnerabilities.

Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant container platform components may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The container platform components will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The container platform registry will ensure the images are current.

The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions.

When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies.
