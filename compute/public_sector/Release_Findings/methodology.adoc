== Methodology

Every release of Prisma Cloud Compute we perform an SCAP scan of the Console and Defender images and post the results here.
This process is based upon the U.S. Air Force's Platform 1 https://repo1.dso.mil/ironbank-tools/ironbank-pipeline/-/blob/master/stages/scanning/oscap-compliance-run.sh["Repo One" OpenSCAP scan] of the Prisma Cloud Compute images.
We then compare the scan results to https://ironbank.dso.mil/about[IronBank's] latest approved UBI8-minimal scan findings, any discrepancies are addressed or justified and the results are posted here.

The scanning process is as follows:

. Build RedHat Enterprise Linux server
. Install openscap-utils package
. Pull the latest SCAP content from the https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases[Compliance as Code] GitHub repository.
. Scan the Console and Defender images
