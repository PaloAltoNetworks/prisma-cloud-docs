The Prisma Cloud Compute module is not within the boundaries of this certification but is available within the FedRAMP certified Prisma Cloud Console.
If you require FedRAMP certification, use the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/welcome/pcee_vs_pcce.html[Prisma Cloud Compute Edition, which is the self-hosted version].

GSA has published guidance for the https://www.fedramp.gov/2021-03-16-Vulnerability-Scanning-doc/[FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for Containers].
If your organization is offering your own FedRAMP services, you can use Prisma Cloud Compute to facilitate in the service's FedRAMP certification.
The configuration settings for Prisma Cloud Compute's features and functions to support an organization's FedRAMP certification can be found xref:../Implementation_Guides/fedramp.adoc[here].

=== Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)
Palo Alto Networks is in the process of developing a xref:../Implementation_Guides/stig.adoc[DISA STIG for the configuration of a Prisma Cloud Compute implementation.]
We have decided to post the draft STIG settings here to facilitate collaboration.
Please note this is a work in progress.
