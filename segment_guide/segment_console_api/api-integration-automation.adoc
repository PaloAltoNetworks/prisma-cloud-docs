=== Automation

Allows you to define some code and specify the conditions under which it
should be executed.

==== Example

[source,json]
----
{
  "condition": "function when(m, params) { return { continue: true }}",
  "disabled": false,
  "immediateExecution": false,
  "name": "the name",
  "protected": false,
  "tokenRenew": false,
  "trigger": "Time"
}
----

==== Relations

===== `GET /automations`

Retrieves the list of automations.

Parameters:

* `q` (`string`): Filtering query. Consequent `q` parameters will form
an or.

===== `POST /automations`

Creates a new Automation.

===== `DELETE /automations/:id`

Deletes the automation with the given ID.

Parameters:

* `q` (`string`): Filtering query. Consequent `q` parameters will form
an or.

===== `GET /automations/:id`

Retrieves the automation with the given ID.

===== `PUT /automations/:id`

Updates the automation with the given ID.

===== `GET /automations/:id/triggers`

Allows a system to trigger the automation if its `trigger` property is
set to `RemoteCall`.

===== `POST /automations/:id/triggers`

Allows a system to trigger the automation if its `trigger` property is
set to `RemoteCall`.

==== Attributes

===== `ID` [`identifier`,`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `string`

Identifier of the object.

===== `actions`

Type: `[]string`

Contains the code that will be executed if the condition is met.

===== `annotations`

Type: `map[string][]string`

===== `associatedTags`

Type: `[]string`

List of tags attached to an entity.

===== `condition`

Type: `string`

Condition contains the code that will be executed to decide if any
action(s) should be executed. Providing a condition for an automation
with a ``Webhook'' trigger type will have no impact as the condition
will not be evaluated. If no condition is defined, then the automation
action(s) will be executed; this behaves akin to a condition that always
succeeds.

===== `createTime` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `time`

Creation date of the object.

===== `description` [`max_length=1024`]

Type: `string`

Description of the object.

===== `disabled`

Type: `boolean`

Defines if the property is disabled.

===== `entitlements`

Type: `_automation_entitlements`

Declares which operations are allowed on which identities.

===== `errors` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `[]string`

Contains the error of the last run.

===== `events`

Type: `_automation_events`

Contains the identity and operation an event must have to trigger the
automation.

===== `immediateExecution`

Type: `boolean`

If set and the trigger is of type Time, the automation will be run at
create or update before being scheduled.

===== `lastExecTime` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `time`

The last successful execution tine.

===== `name` [`required`,`max_length=256`]

Type: `string`

Name of the entity.

===== `namespace` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `string`

Namespace tag attached to an entity.

===== `normalizedTags` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `[]string`

Contains the list of normalized tags of the entities.

===== `parameters`

Type: `map[string]interface{}`

Contains the computed parameters.

===== `protected`

Type: `boolean`

Defines if the object is protected.

===== `schedule`

Type: `string`

Specifies when to run the automation. Must be in valid CRON format. This
only applies if the trigger is set to `Time`.

===== `signature`

Type: `string`

Signature to validate the authenticity of the object.

===== `stdout` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `string`

Contains the standard output of the last run.

===== `token` [`autogenerated`]

Type: `string`

Holds the unique access token used as a password to trigger the
authentication. It will be visible only after creation.

===== `tokenRenew`

Type: `boolean`

If set to `true` a new token will be issued and the previous one
invalidated.

===== `trigger`

Type: `enum(Event | RemoteCall | Webhook | Time)`

Controls when the automation should be triggered.

Default value:

[source,json]
----
"Time"
----

===== `updateTime` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Type: `time`

Last update date of the object.
