=== About installing Defenders on Linux or Windows hosts

To install the Defender on a Linux or Windows host, you must retrieve
and execute our shell script from the target host. We provide three
options for deploying the Defender.

* link:#quick-deployment[Quick deployment]: use the web interface to
obtain the command, then execute it from the target host. Prisma Cloud
Compute (PCC) Console creates and passes an app credential to the
Defender. The Defender uses the app credential to communicate with the
Segment Console API. We recommend this method for demos and
proof-of-concepts. It is also suitable for on-premise production hosts.
* link:#production-cloud-deployment[Production cloud deployment]:
recommended for production AWS, GCP, and Azure hosts. The Defender uses
short-lived tokens from the cloud provider to authenticate to Segment
Console. We provide a command-line based procedure to facilitate
automation.
* link:#advanced-on-premise-deployment[Advanced on-premise deployment]:
an advanced method of deploying the Defender to on-premise production
hosts. You create a restricted token for the Segment Defender. It
exchanges the token for an app credential. We provide a command-line
based procedure to facilitate automation.

=== Quick deployment

[arabic]
. From the PCC Console web interface, expand *Manage*, select
*Defenders*, select *Deploy*, and select *Single Defender*.
. In the first drop-down, select an address of Segment Console that the
target host can access.
. Select one of the following as the *Defender type*:
* *Host Defender - Linux*: deploys the Defender as a Linux service and
creates a processing unit that represents the host, allowing you to
control and monitor all host communications
* *Container Defender - Linux*: deploys the Defender as a container and
creates processing units for all containers on the host, allowing you to
control and monitor all container communications
* *Host Defender - Windows*: deploys the Defender as a Windows service
and creates a processing unit that represents the host, allowing you to
control and monitor all host communications
. Leave the *Listener type* set to *None*.
+
IMPORTANT: Segment does not support the
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/20-08/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/access_control/rbac.html[TCP
listener type]. Selecting *TCP* can cause the Defender to block
connections in an unpredictable manner.
. Ensure that *Segment* is toggled *On*.
. Under *registration type*, select *App credentials*.
. In the *namespace* field, type the namespace that you want to deploy
the Defender to. Example: `/acme/team-a/dev`
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure that you type the namespace correctly and that you
have permissions to deploy the Defender there. The PCC Console performs
no validation on your entries.
. You should be able to leave *Advanced flags* blank. Refer to
link:#advanced-flags[Advanced flags] if you’re interested in learning
about these options.
. Access the target host, such as via SSH.
. Copy the script from the web interface and execute it from a terminal
on the target host.
. Check the status of the Defender.
* *Service*
+
[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl status twistlock-defender-server.service
----
* *Container*
+
[source,console]
----
sudo docker ps
----
. In the PCC Console web interface, expand *Manage*, select *Defenders*,
and select *Manage*.
. You should see the Defender you just deployed with a status of
*Connected*.
. In the Segment Console web interface, expand *Manage*, select
*Defenders*, and toggle *Recursive* to on.
. The Defender you just deployed should be listed with a status of
*Connected*.

=== Production cloud deployment

NOTE: You can use either
https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/20-08/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/api/access_api.html[basic
authentication or client certificates] to authenticate to the Prisma
Cloud Compute (PCC) Console API. In this procedure, we use basic
authentication.

[arabic]
. Ensure that the target host has one of the following.
* *AWS*:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/easily-replace-or-attach-an-iam-role-to-an-existing-ec2-instance-by-using-the-ec2-console/[an
IAM role attached] with read-only access to tags
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policy-structure.html[`ec2:DescribeTags`])
* *GCP*:

service account attached]
* *Azure*:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vmss[assigned
a managed identity]
. Construct a link:../../../concepts/#tags-and-identity[Segment tag]
containing the cloud metadata that identifies Defenders authorized to
register with Segment. The tag must begin with `@auth:` followed by a
key-value pair. Refer to the table below for some common examples.
+
[width="99%",cols="<12%,<25%,<25%,<38%",options="header",]
|===

https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365/How-do-you-find-the-tenant-ID/td-p/89018[Microsoft
documentation].
. On your local host equipped with `apoctl`, set an `ID_TAG` environment
variable. If the target host is on AWS, also set a `ROLE_TAG`
environment variable.
* `ID_TAG` containing the Segment tag you’ve constructed to identify
authorized Defenders
* `ROLE_TAG` (AWS only) containing the name of the IAM role attached to
the instance prepended with `@auth:rolename=`
+
Examples follow.
* *AWS*:

export ID_TAG="@auth:tenantid=cd629cb5-2826-4126-82fd-3f2df5f5bc7"
----
. Set a `TARGET_NS` environment variable containing the Segment
namespace for this Defender. This should be a grandchild namespace. An
example follows.
+
[source,console]
----
export TARGET_NS=/acme/team-a/dev
----
. Create an API authorization that allows the Defender to access the
Segment Console. For the command, select the tab that corresponds to the
cloud provider of the target host.

. From your local host with `apoctl`, generate an app credential with
the `enforcer` role.
+
[source,shell]
----
apoctl appcred create enforcerd --role @auth:role=enforcer > enforcerd.creds
----
. Use the following command to obtain a token with the desired
restrictions. At a minimum, we recommend restricting the length of its
validity and role. You can also require the Defender to register in a
specified namespace or make its request from a specific subnet.
* *Syntax*:
+
[source,console]
----
apoctl auth appcred --path enforcerd.creds \
       --restrict-role @auth:role=enforcer \
       --validity <golang-duration> \

       [--restrict-network <cidr>]
----
* *Fully restricted example*:
+
[source,console]
----
apoctl auth appcred --path enforcerd.creds \
       --restrict-namespace /acme/team-a/dev \
       --restrict-role @auth:role=enforcer \
       --restrict-network 10.0.0.0/8 \

=== Advanced flags

You can add the following flags to modify the Defender’s installation
defaults. When obtaining the command from the PCC Console web interface,
you paste the flags into the *Segment advanced flags* field separated by
spaces. When constructing the command yourself, you include them in the
`segmentation` object as values of the `advancedFlags` key. You can use
the web interface to understand the syntax.

[width="100%",cols="<27%,<73%",options="header",]
|===
|Flag |Description
|`--activate-control-plane-pus` |Pass this flag if you wish to recognize
the PCC and Segment Consoles as processing units, allowing their
communications to be monitored and controlled. By default, the Segment
Defender ignores them.

|`--activate-kube-system-pus` |Pass this flag if you wish to recognize
containers in the `kube-system` namespace as processing units, allowing
their communications to be monitored and controlled. By default, the
Segment Defender ignores them.

|`--activate-openshift-pus` |

|`--application-proxy-port` |

|`--cloud-probe-timeout` |

|`--disable-dns-proxy` |

|`--disable-ebpf` |

|`--dns-server-address` |

|`--docker-socket-address` |

|`--enable-containers` |Start Docker monitor

|`--enable-host-mode` |Defenders deployed as services automatically
protect all communications on the host. Defenders deployed as containers
ignore host communications. You can include this flag for Defenders
deployed as containers to protect host communications.

|`--enable-ipv6` |(*Beta*) The Segment defender ignores IPv6
communications by default. If you have IPv6 enabled and wish to monitor
and control these connections, pass this flag.

|`--enable-kubernetes` |

|`--enforcer-socket-address` |

|`--flow-reporting-interval` |

|`--grpc-server-address` |The Segment Defender runs as a process and
uses a gRPC server to communicate with the Twistlock Defender. You can
use this flag to specify the Unix socket or named pipe of the gRPC
server. Example: `/var/run/aporeto-grpc.sock`

|`--ignore-stopped-containers` |

|`--kubeconfig` |

|`--kubenode` |

|`--log-format` |The Defender generates logs in JSON format by default.
If you wish to use a different format, you can use this flag to specify
it.

|`--log-level` |`default`, `warning`, or `info`

|`--log-to-console` |Set to `off` by default.
