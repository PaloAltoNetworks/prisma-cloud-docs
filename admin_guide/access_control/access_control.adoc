Prisma Cloud provides broad enterprise identity support, integrating with Active Directory, OpenLDAP, Ping, Okta, Shibboleth, Azure AD, and G Suite, allowing you to implement central credential management in the Prisma Cloud Platform.
Define accounts and IAM roles to integrate with your cloud providers in one place and reuse them across the product.
Pluggable cryptography allows you to bring your own certificates, not just for TLS, but also for smart card authentication to Console.
