== Host Defender architecture

=== Host Defender design

Because weâ€™ve built Prisma Cloud expressly for cloud native stacks, the architecture of our agent (what we call Defender) is quite different. 
Rather than having to install a kernel module, or modify the host OS at all, Defender instead runs as systemd or system module (not a Kernel Module) 
in the user space intercepting every syscall interaction and file changes actively blocking or alerting according to the rules defined in the console.
