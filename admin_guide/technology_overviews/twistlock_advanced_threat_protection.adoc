== Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection

Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a collection of malware signatures and IP reputation lists aggregated from commercial threat feeds, open source threat feeds, and Prisma Cloud Labs.
It is delivered to your installation via the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream.

The data in ATP is used by Prisma Cloud's runtime defense system to detect suspicious activities, such as a container communicating with a botnet herder or Tor entry node.
You can augment ATP by xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#import-malware-signatures[importing custom malware data] and xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#import-ip-reputation-lists[importing IP reputation lists].
ATP is the combination of both the Prisma Cloud-provided data set and your own custom data set.

The following hypothetical scenario illustrates how ATP protects your containers:

. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an app running in a container.

. The attacker attempts to download malware into the container from a distribution point.

. ATP detects both the connection to the malware server and the write of the malicious file to the container file system.

. An audit is generated.
Audits can be viewed in Console under *Monitor > Events > Container Audits*.

ATP also protects hosts.
Host audits can viewed under *Monitor > Events > Host Audits*.


=== Enabling ATP

ATP is enabled in the default rules that ship with the product, with the effect set to alert.
You can impose more stringent control by setting effect to prevent or block.
xref:../runtime_defense/runtime_defense_fs.adoc#[Runtime defense for file systems] lets you actively stop (block) any container that tries to download malware.

To disable ATP, create or modify a runtime rule, select the *General* tab, and set *Enable Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection* to *Off*.
When ATP is disabled, container interaction with malicious files or IP endpoints does not trigger a runtime event.
