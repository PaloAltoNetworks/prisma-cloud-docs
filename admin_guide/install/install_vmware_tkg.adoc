== VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG)

https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid[VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG)] lets you deploy Kubernetes clusters on demand.
Use our standard Kubernetes install procedure to deploy Prisma Cloud to TKG.
The only difference between TKG and standard Kubernetes is the location of the Docker socket.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
A single line change in the Prisma Cloud configuration file lets you specify the path to the Docker socket in TKG.
From there, follow the normal Kubernetes install procedure.

=== Preflight checklist

To ensure that your installation goes smoothly, work through the following checklist and validate that all requirements are met.

[.section]
==== General

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* You have a valid Prisma Cloud license key and access token.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
* You have access to a Prisma Cloud tenant.

* You have adequate permissions (i.e. role) to deploy Defenders.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

[.section]
==== Cluster

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* You have provisioned a TKG cluster that meets the minimum xref:../install/system_requirements.adoc[system requirements].
endif::compute_edition[]

* Prisma Cloud Defender requires elevated privileges.
Ensure that the _Set Privileged Containers_ permission is set to true (enabled) in your TKG cluster.

* The nodes in your cluster can reach Prisma Cloud's cloud registry (registry-auth.twistlock.com).

[.section]
==== Permissions

* You can create and delete namespaces in your cluster.

* You can Run _kubectl create_ commands.

[.section]
==== Firewalls and external IP addresses

Validate that the following ports are open:

ifdef::compute_edition[]
*Prisma Cloud Console*:

* Incoming: 8083, 8084
* Outgoing: 443, 53
endif::compute_edition[]

*Prisma Cloud Defenders*:

* Incoming: None
ifdef::compute_edition[]
* Outgoing: 8084
endif::compute_edition[]
ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
* Outgoing: 443 to Prisma Cloud
endif::prisma_cloud[]

=== Install Prisma Cloud

Prepare your TKG environment, then use the standard procedure for installing Prisma Cloud on Kubernetes.


[.task]
==== Download the Prisma Cloud software

Download the Prisma Cloud software to your cluster's controller node.

[.procedure]
. xref:../welcome/releases.adoc#download[Download] the current recommended release.

. Download the release tarball to your cluster controller.

  $ wget <LINK_TO_CURRENT_RECOMMENDED_RELEASE_LINK>

. Unpack the Prisma Cloud release tarball.

  $ mkdir twistlock
  $ tar xvzf twistlock_<VERSION>.tar.gz -C twistlock/

. Open _twistlock/twistlock.cfg_ and set the path to the Docker socket.

  DOCKER_SOCKET=${DOCKER_SOCKET:-/var/vcap/data/sys/run/docker/docker.sock}

. In twistlock.cfg, set RUN CONSOLE AS ROOT to true.

  RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT=${RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT:-true}


==== Install Console and Defenders

Proceed with the standard instructions for installing xref:../install/install_kubernetes.adoc#install-console[Prisma Cloud on Kubernetes].

=== Install Prisma Cloud Defender DaemonSet

The standard location of the Docker socket in Kubernetes is _/var/run/docker.sock_.
In TKG, the Docker socket can be located in either _/var/vcap/data/sys/run/docker/docker.sock_ or _/var/vcap/sys/run/docker/docker.sock_.
Before you deploy your Defender DaemonSet, you must manually update the Defender DaemonSet configuration file with the path to the Docker socket.

[.procedure]
. Use the standard procedure for xref:install_kubernetes.adoc#install-defender[generating a standard DaemonSet file].
+
The DaemonSet file can be generated from the Prisma Cloud UI.
Go to *Prisma Cloud > Compute > Defenders > Deploy > DaemonSet* and configure your deployment.
At the bottom of the page, choose *Download YAML directly*.

. Open _defender.yaml_ for editing, and update the file so Defender can find the Docker socket.

.. In _volumeMounts_, _name: docker-sock-folder_, set _mountPath_ to:

  mountPath: "/var/vcap/data/sys/run/docker"

.. In _env_, _name: _DOCKER_CLIENT_ADDRESS_, set _value_ to:

  value: "/var/vcap/data/sys/run/docker/docker.sock"

.. In _volumes_, _name: docker-sock-folder_, _hostPath_, set _path_ to: 
  
  path: "/var/vcap/data/sys/run/docker"

. Deploy your Defender DaemonSet.

.. Create the Twistlock namespace.

 $ kubectl create namespace twistlock

.. Deploy the Defender DaemonSet.

 $ kubectl create -f defender.yaml
