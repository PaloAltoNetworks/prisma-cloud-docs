== System requirements

Before installing Prisma Cloud, verify that your environment meets the minimum requirements.

For information about when Prisma Cloud adds and drops support for third party software, see our xref:../welcome/support_lifecycle.adoc#third-party-software[support lifecycle] page.


[.section]
=== Hardware

*Metal*: Prisma Cloud has the following hardware requirements:

*Architecture*: x86_64

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* Console --
** When up to 1,000 Defenders are connected, Console requires 4 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM, and 100GB of persistent storage.
** When 1,001 - 10,000 Defenders are connected, Console requires 8 vCPUs, 30GB of RAM, and 500GB SSD of persistent storage.
** When more than 10,000 Defenders are connected, Console requires a baseline of 8 vCPUs, 30GB of RAM, and 500GB SSD of persistent storage, with another 4 vCPUS and 10GB of RAM for every increment of 5,000 Defenders.
For example, for 20,000 Defenders, Console requires a total of 16 vCPUs, 50GB of RAM and 500GB SSD of persistent storage.
+
NOTE: Console uses cgroups to cap resource usage.
When more than 1,000 Defenders are connected, it's recommended to disable this cap by enabling the DISABLE_CONSOLE_CGROUP_LIMITS flag in twistlock.cfg.
+
endif::compute_edition[]

* Defender --
256MB of RAM and 8GB of host storage.
+
NOTE: Defender uses cgroups to cap resource usage at 512MB of RAM and 900 CPU shares; typical load is ~1-5% CPU and 30-70MB RAM
+
NOTE: Defender stores its data in _/var_.
When allocating disk space for Defender, be sure the required space is available in _/var_.
+
NOTE: Defenders are designed to be portable containers that collect data.
Any data that must be persisted is sent to Console for storage.
Defenders themselves do not require persistent storage.
Do not deploy persistent storage for Defenders, because it can corrupt Defender files.

* Defenders providing registry scanning--
2GB of RAM, 20GB of storage, and 2 CPU cores.

* CI integration (Jenkins, twistcli) --
Required storage space depends on the size of the scanned images.
The required disk space is 1.5 times the size of the largest image to be scanned, per executor.
For example, if you have a Jenkins instance with two executors, and your largest container image is 500MB, then you need at least 1.5GB of storage space (500MB * 1.5 * 2).

*VMs*: Prisma Cloud has been tested on the following hypervisors:

* Microsoft Hyper-V
* VirtualBox
* VMware

*Cloud*: Prisma Cloud can run on nearly any cloud IaaS platform. Prisma Cloud has been tested on the following services:

* Amazon Web Services
* Google Compute Engine
* IBM Cloud
* Microsoft Azure
* Oracle Cloud


ifdef::compute_edition[]
[.section]
=== File systems

If you're deploying Prisma Cloud Console to AWS and you're using the EFS file system, the following minimum performance characteristics are required:

* *Performance mode:* General purpose
* *Throughput mode:* Provisioned.
Provision 0.1 MiB/s per deployed Defender.
For example, if you plan to deploy 10 Defenders, provision 1 MiB/s of throughput.
endif::compute_edition[]

[#_kernel]
=== Kernel capabilities

Prisma Cloud Defender requires the following kernel capabilities.
More info about each capability can be found on the Linux capabilities man page.

* `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
* `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`
* `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`
* `CAP_MKNOD`
* `CAP_SETFCAP`

When running on a Docker host, Prisma Cloud Defender uses the following files/folder on the host:

* _/var/run/docker.sock_ -- Required for accessing Docker runtime.
* _/var/lib/twistlock_ -- Required for storing Prisma Cloud data.
* _/dev/log_ -- Required for writing to syslog.


[.section]
[#_docker_support]
=== Docker Engine

Prisma Cloud provides support only for the versions of Docker Engine that Docker itself supports.  Prisma Cloud supports the following and later versions.  Only official mainstream Docker releases are supported.

// Note: Starting with 18.09, Docker Engine CE and EE versions will be aligned, where EE is a superset of CE.
// They will ship concurrently with the same patch version based on the same code base.
// See https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/

* CE 20.10.5, 19.03, 18.09
* EE 19.03.4

For storage drivers, overlay2, overlay, and devicemapper are supported.
For more information, please refer to Docker's guide to https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver[selecting a storage driver].

NOTE: The versions of Docker Engine listed in this section apply to versions independently installed on a host.
These versions might not be the same as the versions shipped as a part of an orchestrator, such as Red Hat OpenShift.
In such cases, Prisma Cloud supports the version of Docker Engine that ships with any Prisma Cloud-supported version of the orchestrator.

[.section]
=== Shells

For Linux, Prisma Cloud depends on the Bash shell.

[.section]
=== Browsers

Prisma Cloud supports the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Edge.

For Microsoft Edge, we only support the new Chromium-based version (80.0.361 and later).


[.section]
=== Cortex XDR 

Prisma Cloud Defenders can work alongside Cortex XDR agents. 
Currently, users need to manualy add exceptions in Console for both agents to work together.
In a future release, there will be out-of-the-box support for co-existence.
Users can disable the Defender runtime defense when a Cortex XDR agent is present.

To allow for both the solutions to co-exist:

. Add the Cortex agent as a trustable executable.
For more information, see to xref:../configure/custom_feeds.adoc#create-a-list-of-trusted-executables[Creating a trusted exeuctable].

. Suppress runtime alerts from the Cortex agent by adding custom runtime rules that allow the Cortex agent process and file path.
