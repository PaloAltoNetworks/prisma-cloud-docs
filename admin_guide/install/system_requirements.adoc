== System requirements

Before installing Prisma Cloud, verify that your environment meets the minimum requirements.


[.section]
=== Hardware

*Metal*: Prisma Cloud has the following hardware requirements:

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* Console --
** When up to 1000 Defenders are connected, Console requires 4 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM, and 100GB of persistent storage.
** When 1001 - 5000 Defenders are connected, Console requires 8 vCPUs, 30GB of RAM, and 1TB of persistent storage.
endif::compute_edition[]

* Defender --
256MB of RAM and 8GB of host storage.
+
NOTE: Defender uses cgroups to cap resource usage at 512MB of RAM and 900 CPU shares; typical load is ~1-5% CPU and 30-70MB RAM
+
NOTE: Defender stores its data in _/var_.
When allocating disk space for Defender, be sure the required space is available in _/var_.
+
NOTE: Defenders are designed to be portable containers that collect data.
Any data that must be persisted is sent to to Console for storage.
Defenders themselves do not require persistent storage.
Do not deploy persistent storage for Defenders because it can corrupt Defender files.

* Registry scanning --
2GB of RAM, 20GB of storage, and 2 CPU cores.

* CI integration (Jenkins, twistcli) --
Required storage space depends on the size of the scanned images.
The required disk space is 1.5 times the size of the largest image to be scanned, per executor.
For example, if you have a Jenkins instance with two executors, and your largest container image is 500MB, then you need at least 1.5GB of storage space (500MB * 1.5 * 2).

*VMs*: Prisma Cloud has been tested on the following hypervisors:

* Microsoft Hyper-V
* VirtualBox
* VMware

*Cloud*: Prisma Cloud can run on nearly any cloud IaaS platform. Prisma Cloud has been tested on the following services:

* Amazon Web Services
* Google Compute Engine
* IBM Cloud
* Microsoft Azure
* Oracle Cloud

[.section, #_kernel]
=== Kernel

Prisma Cloud Defender requires the following kernel capabilities.
More info about each capability can be found on the Linux capabilities man page.

* `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
* `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`
* `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`
* `CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL`
* `CAP_MKNOD`
* `CAP_SETFCAP`

When running on a Docker host, Prisma Cloud Defender uses the following files/folder on the host:

* _/var/run/docker.sock_ -- Required for accessing Docker runtime.
* _/var/lib/twistlock_ -- Required for storing Prisma Cloud data.
* _/dev/log_ -- Required for writing to syslog.


[.section, #_docker_support]
=== Docker Engine

Since Prisma Cloud often adds new features that take advantage of new Docker capabilities, Prisma Cloud provides commercial support only for the versions of Docker Engine that Docker itself supports.
This ensures that updates can be properly tested and supported throughout customers' environments.
Prisma Cloud follows the same support lifecycle policy as Docker Enterprise Edition.
For more information, see Docker's
https://success.docker.com/article/maintenance-lifecycle[Maintenance Lifecycle].

New versions of Docker Engine are supported shortly after they are https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/[released].
Prisma Cloud supports the following and later versions.
Only official mainstream Docker releases are supported.

// Note: Starting with 18.09, Docker Engine CE and EE versions will be aligned, where EE is a superset of CE.
// They will ship concurrently with the same patch version based on the same code base.
// See https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/

* CE 19.03, 18.06
* EE 19.03, 18.03

For storage drivers, overlay2, overlay, and devicemapper are supported.
For more information, please refer to Docker's guide to https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver[selecting a storage driver]. 

NOTE: The versions of Docker Engine listed in this section apply to versions independently installed on a host.
These versions might not be the same as the versions shipped as a part of an orchestrator, such as Red Hat OpenShift.
In such cases, Prisma Cloud supports the version of Docker Engine that ships with any Prisma Cloud-supported version of the orchestrator.

[.section]
=== Podman

Podman is a daemon-less container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers on Linux. The twistcli tool can use the preinstalled Podman binary to scan CRI images.

The following version of Podman are supported:

* Podman 1.6

[.section]

ifdef::compute_edition[]
[.section]
=== File systems

If you're deploying Prisma Cloud Console to AWS and you're using the EFS file system, the following minimum performance characteristics are required:

* *Performance mode:* General purpose
* *Throughput mode:* Provisioned.
Provision 0.1 MiB/s per deployed Defender.
For example, if you plan to deploy 10 Defenders, provision 1 MiB/s of throughput.
endif::compute_edition[]


[.section]
=== Jenkins

Prisma Cloud provides a Jenkins plugin that scans images for vulnerabilities after they are built.

The Prisma Cloud plugin supports the following Jenkins versions: 

- 2.190, 2.204 and 2.222 (these versions support Podman <2)
- 2.235 (this version doesn't support Podman)

Prisma Cloud tests the latest (or near-latest) LTS releases of Jenkins.
These versions are guaranteed to be compatible with Prisma Cloud.
Other recent LTS versions should also work.
However, if you’re having issues with the Prisma Cloud plugin, we recommend that you upgrade to the version of Jenkins that Prisma Cloud has tested.


[.section]
=== Shell

For Linux, Prisma Cloud depends on the Bash shell.
For Windows, Prisma Cloud depends on PowerShell.

The shell environment variable `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST` should be set to `0` or unset before running any commands that interact with the Prisma Cloud cloud registry, such as Defender installs or upgrades.


[.section]
=== Browsers

Prisma Cloud supports the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Edge.

For Microsoft Edge, we only support the new Chromium-based version (80.0.361 and later).


[.section]
=== Image base layers

[.section]
=== Default UID/GID

ifdef::compute_edition[]
When installing Console with _twistlock.sh_, the Prisma Cloud data folder (_var/lib/twistlock_) owner and group are set to a UID and GID of 2674, and the Console process runs as user 2674 by default.
To configure Console to run as root, open _twistlock.cfg_ and set RUN_CONSOLE_AS_ROOT to true before running _twistlock.sh_.
You must run Console as root if you want it to listen on port 443 or some other privileged port.

When installing Console in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, the Console process runs a root by default.
endif::compute_edition[]

Defenders always run as root.
Although Defenders run as root, they drop the capabilities they don't need.
For a list of capabilities that Defenders retain, see xref:../technology_overviews/defender_architecture.adoc[Defender Architecture].
