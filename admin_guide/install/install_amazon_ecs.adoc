== Amazon ECS

ifdef::compute_edition[]
This quickstart guide shows you how to deploy Prisma Cloud on a simple cluster that has a single infrastructure node and two worker nodes.
Console runs on the infrastructure node, and an instance of Defender runs on each of the worker nodes.

Console is the Prisma Cloud management interface, and it runs as a service.
The parameters of the service are described in a task definition, and the task definition is written in JSON format.

Defender protects your containerized environment according to the policies you set in Console.

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]

This quickstart guide shows you how to deploy Prisma Cloud defenders on a simple cluster that has two worker nodes.

Defender protects your containerized environment according to the policies you set in Prisma Cloud Console.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

To automatically deploy an instance of Defender on each worker node in your cluster, you will use a user data script in the worker node launch configuration.
User data scripts run custom configuration commands when a new instance is started.
You will set up the user data script to call the Prisma Cloud API to download, install, and start Defender.

NOTE: This guide assumes you know very little about AWS ECS.
As such, it is extremely prescriptive.
If you are already familiar with AWS ECS and do not need assistance navigating the interface, simply read the section synopsis, which summarizes all key configurations.

ifdef::compute_edition[]

The installation described in this article is meant to be "production grade" in that data is persisted across restarts of the nodes.
If an infrastructure node were to go down, ECS should be able to reschedule the Console service on any healthy node, and Console should still have access to its state.
To enable this capability, you must attach storage that is accessible from each of your infrastructure nodes, and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is an excellent choice.

When you have more than one infrastructure node, ECS can run Console on any one of them.
Defenders need a reliable way to connect to Console, no matter where it runs.
A load balancer automatically directs traffic to the the node where Console runs, and offers a stable interface that Defenders can use to connect to Console and that operators can use to access its web interface.

NOTE: We assume you are deploying Prisma Cloud to the default VPC.
If you are not using the default VPC, adjust your settings accordingly.

=== Using a private registry

For maximum control over your environment, you might want to store the Console container image in your own private registry, and then install Prisma Cloud from your private registry.
When the Console service is started, ECS retrieves the image from your registry.
This procedure shows you how to push the Console container image to Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

*Prerequisites:*

* AWS CLI is installed on your machine.
It is required to push the Console image to your registry.

[.procedure]
. Go to the directory where you unpacked the Prisma Cloud release tarball.

  $ cd twistlock/

. Load the Console image.

  $ docker load < ./twistlock_console.tar.gz

. Go to *Services > Containers > Elastic Container Service*.

. In the left menu, click *Repositories*.

. Click *Create repository*.

. Follow the AWS instructions for logging in to the registry, tagging the Console image, and pushing it to your repo.
+
Be sure to update your Console task definition so that the value for `image` points to your private registry.
