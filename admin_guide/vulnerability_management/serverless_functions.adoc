== Serverless function scanning

Prisma Cloud can scan serverless functions for vulnerabilities.
Prisma Cloud supports AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.

Serverless computing is an execution model in which a cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources and schedules the execution of functions provided by users.
Serverless architectures delegate the operational responsibilities, along with many security concerns, to the cloud provider. In particular, your app itself is still prone to attack.
The vulnerabilities in your code and associated dependencies are the footholds attackers use to compromise an app.
Prisma Cloud can show you a function's dependencies, and surface the vulnerabilities in those dependent components.


[.section]
=== Capabilities

For serverless, Prisma Cloud can scan Node.js, Python, Java, and C# packages.
For a list of supported runtimes see xref:../install/system_requirements.adoc[system requirements].

Prisma Cloud scans are triggered by the following events:

* When the settings change, including when new functions are added for scanning.
* When you explicitly click the *Scan* button in the *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Functions > Scanned Functions* page.
* Periodically.
By default, Prisma Cloud rescans serverless functions every 24 hours, but you can configure a custom interval in *Manage > System > Scan*.

=== Scanning a serverless function

Configure Prisma Cloud to periodically scan your serverless functions.
Unlike image scanning, all function scanning is handled by Console.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Functions > Functions*.

. Click *Add scope*.

. In the dialog, enter the following settings:

.. In *Provider*, select your cloud platform.

.. Specify a region.

.. Specify a function name.
+
NOTE: Wildcards are supported.
+
.. Select or xref:../authentication/credentials_store.adoc[create credentials] so that Prisma Cloud can access your account.
+
* AWS -- Specify either an IAM user credential (access key ID and secret access key) or IAM role.
* Google -- Specify a service key.
* Azure -- Specify a user access token.

.. Specify a cap for the number of functions to scan.
+
NOTE: Prisma Cloud scans the X most recent functions, where X is the cap value.  Set this value to '0' to scan all functions.
+
.. Select *Scan only latest versions* to only scan the latest version of each function.  Otherwise, the scanning will cover all versions of each function up to the specified *cap* value. 
+ 
.. Click *Add*.

. Click the yellow save button.

. View the scan report.
Go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Functions > Scanned functions*.


=== Authenticating with AWS

The serverless scanner is implemented as part of Console.
The scanner requires the *AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess* permissions policy.

*IAM User*

If authenticating with an IAM user, use the Security Token Service (STS) to temporarily issue security credentials to Prisma Cloud to scan your Lambda functions.
AWS STS is considered a best practice for IAM users per the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
For more on how to use AWS STS, see xref:../authentication/credentials_store.adoc#_aws_security_token_service_sts[here].

When authenticating with an IAM user, Console can access and scan functions across multiple regions.

*IAM Role*

ifdef::compute_edition[]
The Prisma Cloud serverless scanner can also authenticate with AWS using an IAM role.
If Console authenticates with AWS using an IAM role, it can assume roles using STS to assume roles in other regions.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
IAM roles cannot be used in Prisma Cloud serverless scanning as the Console is not hosted within AWS for Enterprise Edition.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

[.task]
=== Scanning Azure Functions

Azure Functions are architected differently than AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.
Azure function apps can hold multiple functions.
The functions are not segregated from each other.
They share the same file system.
Rather than separately scanning each function in a function app, download the root directory of the function app, which contains all its functions, and scan them as a bundle.

NOTE: Prisma Cloud only scans Linux functions that use *External package URL* as the deployment technology.
For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies[Deployment technologies in Azure Functions].

To do this, you must know the Region, Name (of the function), and Service Key.
To get the Service Key, download and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[install the Azure CLI], then:

[.procedure]
. Log into your account with a user that has the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles[User Account Administrator] role.

  $ az login

. Get the service key.

 $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --name twistlock-azure-serverless-scanning --role contributor
+
Sample output from the previous command:
+
  {
    "clientId": "f8e9de2o-45bd-af94-ae11-b9r8c5tfy3b6",
    "clientSecret": "4dfds482-6sdd-4dsb-b5ff-56123043c4dc",
    "subscriptionId": "ea19322m-z2bd-501c-dd11-234m547a944e",
    "tenantId": "c189c61a-6c27-41c3-9949-ca5c8cc4a624",
    "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
    "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
    "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
    "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
  }

. Copy the JSON output, which is your secret key, and paste it into the *Service Key* field for your Azure credentials in Prisma Cloud Console.


=== Scanning functions at build time with twistcli

You can also use the `twistcli` command line utility to scan your serverless functions.
First download your serverless function as a ZIP file, then run:
 
  $ twistcli serverless scan <SERVERLESS_FUNCTION.ZIP>
  
To view scan reports in Console, go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Functions > CI* or *Monitor > Compliance > Functions > CI*.
