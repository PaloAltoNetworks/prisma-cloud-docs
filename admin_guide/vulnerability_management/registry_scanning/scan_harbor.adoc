== Scan images on Harbor

Configure Prisma Cloud to scan your Harbor registry.
To scan a repository in Harbor, create a new registry scan setting.

[.procedure]
. Open Console

. Go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Registry*.

. Click *Add registry settings*.

. In the dialog, enter the following information:

.. In the *Version* drop-down list, select *Harbor*.

.. Leave the *Registry* field blank.

.. In *Repository name*, enter the name of the repo to scan.

.. In *Credential*, select the credentials to use.
+
If Console doesn't have a copy of your credentials yet, click *Add New*.
Select either *Basic authentication*, and fill out the rest of the fields.

.. In *OS type*, specify whether the repo holds *Linux* or *Windows* images.

.. In *Scanner*, select *Automatic*.
+
Console automatically selects an available Defender to execute the scan job.
Alternatively, you can explicitly select a Defender from the drop-down list.
Defenders are listed according to the hosts where they run.
For more information, see xref:../../vulnerability_management/registry_scanning.adoc#_deployment_patterns[deployment patterns].

.. In *Number of scanners*, enter the number of Defenders across which scan jobs can be distributed.

.. Set *Cap* to the number of most recent images to scan.
Leaving *Cap* set to the default value of *5* will scan the most recent 5 images.
Setting this field to *0* will scan all images.

.. Click *Add*.

. Click the yellow save button.
