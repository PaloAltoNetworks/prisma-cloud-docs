To scan a repository in Azure Container Registry (ACR), create a new registry scan setting.

*Prerequisites:* You have xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc#[installed a Defender] somewhere in your environment.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Registry*.

.. In the *Version* drop-down list, select *Azure Container Registry*.

.. In the *Registry* field, enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the registry’s ACR login server.

The format for the FQDN is *<REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io*, where *<REGISTRY_NAME>* is a unique value specified when the registry was created.
Example: *example.azurecr.io*.
