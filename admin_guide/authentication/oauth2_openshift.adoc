== Integrate Prisma Cloud with OpenShift

OpenShift users can log into Prisma Cloud Console using OpenShift as an OAuth 2.0 provider.

The OpenShift master includes a built-in OAuth server.
You can integrate OpenShift authentication into Prisma Cloud.
When users attempt to access Prisma Cloud, which is a protected resource, they are redirected to authenticate with OpenShift.
After authenticating successfully, they are redirected back to Prisma Cloud Console with an OAuth token.
This token scopes what the user can do in OpenShift.
Prisma Cloud only needs the auth token to get the user's info (e.g. user name, email), and check the Prisma Cloud database to see if this user is authorized.
If so, Prisma Cloud creates a JWT token, with a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] claim, to complete the authentication process to Console.
Roles are assigned based on users and group information specified in Console.

=== Integrate Prisma Cloud with OpenShift

Configure Prisma Cloud so that OpenShift users can log into Prisma Cloud with the same identity.


[.procedure]

. In OpenShift, https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/authentication/configuring-internal-oauth.html#oauth-register-additional-client_configuring-internal-oauth[register Prisma Cloud as an OAuth client].
Set the redirect URL to:
+
\https://<CONSOLE>:<PORT>/api/v1/authenticate/callback/oauth.

. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Identity Providers > OAuth 2.0*.

. Set *Integrate Oauth 2.0 users and groups with Prisma Cloud* to *Enabled*.

. Set *Identity provider* to *OpenShift*.

. Set *Client ID* to the *name* of the OAuth client you set up in OpenShift.

. Set *Client secret* to the *secret* in the OAuth client you set up in OpenShift.

. Set *Auth URL* to *\https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize*.

. Set *Token URL* to *\https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token*.

. In *User Info API URL*, enter the TCP endpoint for the OpenShift API server.
For example, *\https://openshift.default.svc.cluster.local*.

. Click *Save*.

=== Prisma Cloud to OpenShift user identity mappings

Create a Prisma Cloud user for every OpenShift user that should have access to Prisma Cloud.

After the user is authenticated, Prisma Cloud uses the access token to query OpenShift for the user's information (user name, email).
The user information returned from OpenShift is compared against the Prisma Cloud Console database to determine if the user is authorized.
If so, a JWT token is returned.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add User*.

. Set *Username* to the OpenShift user name.

. Set *Auth method* to *OAuth*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] for the user.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OAuth*, and then click *Login*.

==== Prisma Cloud to OpenShift group mappings

Use groups to streamline how Prisma Cloud roles are assigned to users.
When you use groups to assign roles, you don't have to create individual Prisma Cloud accounts for each user.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

. Click *Add Group*.

. In *Name*, enter an OpenShift group name.

. In *Authentication method*, select *External Providers*.

. In *Authentication Providers*, select *OAuth group*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] for the members of the group.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OAuth*, and then click *Login*.
