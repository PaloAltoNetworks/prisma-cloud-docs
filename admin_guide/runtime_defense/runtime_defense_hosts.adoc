== Runtime defense for hosts

Without secure hosts, you cannot have secure containers.
Host machines are a critical component in the container environment, and they must be secured with the same care as containers.
Prisma Cloud Defender collects data about your hosts for monitoring and analysis.

Runtime host protection is designed to continuously report an up-to-date context for your hosts.
It's not designed to enforce policy.
The one exception is Defender's process monitoring for hosts, which can alert or block undesired processes.


=== Enabling host runtime protection

Runtime protection for hosts is enabled by default.
When Defender is installed, it automatically starts collecting data about the underlying host.
Prisma Cloud ships with a default rule named _Default - alert on suspicious runtime behavior_, which enables some basic monitoring.
To see the rule, open Console, then go to *Defend > Runtime > Host Policy*.

As part of the default rule, Prisma Cloud Advanced Threat Protection (TATP) is enabled.
TATP supplements runtime protection by alerting you when:

* Malware is found anywhere on the host file system.
* Connections are made to banned IP addresses.

Process monitoring is also enabled in the default rule, with both crypto miner detection and SSH session history enabled.
To view the data collected, go to *Monitor > Runtime > Host Observations*, and select a host from the table.


=== Host runtime policy

Create new rules to enhance host protection.
Go to *Defend > Runtime > Host Policy*, and click *Add Rule*.

image::host_runtime_rule.png[width=700]

Rules can be scoped by:

* Hostname.
* Labels.
* Cloud account.

For labels, Prisma Cloud supports AWS tags, as well as distro attributes.
Distro attributes are designed for central security teams that manage the policies in Console, but have little influence over the operational practices of the groups that run apps in the environments being secured.
If the central security team can't rely on naming conventions or labels to apply policies that are OS-specific (e.g. different compliance checks for different OSs), they can leverage the distro attributes.
Supported distro attributes are:

* Distro name (e.g., Ubuntu).
* Distro version (e.g., 18.04).


==== Process monitoring

Process monitoring lets you alert or block specific processes by explicit policy.
The *Processes* tab in the host runtime rule dialog has suggestions for processes known to aid exploits.


==== Log inspection

Prisma Cloud lets you collect and analyze operating systems and application logs for security events.
For each inspection rule, specify the log file to parse and any number of inspection expressions.
Inspection expressions support the https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 regular expression syntax].

A number of predefined rules are provided for apps such as sshd, mongod, and nginx.


==== Networking

Prisma Cloud lets you secure host networking.
You can filter DNS traffic and alert on inbound and outbound connections.


[.section]
===== DNS

When DNS monitoring is enabled, Prisma Cloud filters DNS lookups.
By default, DNS monitoring is disabled.
Dangerous domains are detected as follows:

* Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream -- Prisma Cloud’s threat feed contains a list of known bad domains.
* Explicit allow and deny lists -- Host runtime rules let you augment the Prisma Cloud’s Intelligence Stream data with your own lists of known good and bad domains.

In your runtime rules, set *Effect* to configure how Defender handles DNS lookups from containers:

* *Disable* -- DNS monitoring is disabled.

* *Alert* -- DNS monitoring is enabled.
Anomalous activity generates audits.

* *Prevent* -- DNS monitoring is enabled.
Anomalous activity generates audits.
Anomalous DNS lookups are dropped.

[.section]
===== IP connectivity

You can raise alerts when inbound or outbound connections are established.
Specify inbound ports, and outbound IPs and ports.

Outbound connections are event-driven, which means that as soon as a process attempts to establish a connection, you'll be notified.
Prisma Cloud polls inbound connections, which means you'll be notified periodically, and not necessarily the moment an inbound connection is established.


==== Activities

Set up rules to audit xref:../audit/host_activity.adoc[host events].


=== File integrity management (FIM)

Changes to critical files can reduce your overall security posture, and they can be the first indicator of an attack in progress.
Prisma Cloud FIM continually watches the files and directories in your monitoring profile for changes.
You can configure to FIM to detect:

* Reads or writes to sensitive files, such as certificates, secrets, and configuration files.

* Binaries written to the file system.

* Abnormally installed software.
For example, files written to a file system by programs other than apt-get.

A monitoring profile consists of rules, where each rule specifies the path to monitor, the file operation, and exceptions.

image::runtime_defense_hosts_fim_rule.png[width=600]

The file operations supported are:

* Writes to files or directories.
When you specify a directory, recursive monitoring is supported.

* Reads.
When you specify a directory, recursive monitoring isn't supported.

* Attribute changes.
The attributes watched are permissions, ownership, timestamps, and links.
When you specify a directory, recursive monitoring isn't supported.


=== Monitoring

To view the data collected about each host, go to *Monitor > Runtime > Host Observations*, and select a host from the table.


==== Apps

The *Apps* tab lists the running programs on the host.
New apps are added to the list only on network events.

image::host_runtime_apps.png[width=700]

For each app, Prisma Cloud records the following details:

* Running processes (limited to 10).
* Outgoing ports (limited to 5).
* Listening ports (limited to 5).

Proc events will add the proc only to existing apps in the profile.
Defender will cache the runtime data, saving timestamps for each of the 10 processes last spawn time. If 10 processes exists and the app spawned another process, the oldest proc will be overwritten and update of this app will be sent to the console.

Limitations:

* Maximum of 100 apps.
* Last 10 spawned processes for each app.
If 10 processes are recorded alrrady, and the app spawned another process, the oldest process is overwritten, and replaced with the latest one.


==== SSH session history

The SSH events tab shows ssh commands run in interactive sessions, limited to 100 events per hour

image::host_runtime_ssh_history.png[width=700]


==== Unattended security updates

Prisma Cloud periodically checks for unattended security updates.
It's implemented as a compliance check.
Prisma Cloud probes for security updates every time the scanner runs (every 24 hours, by default).
The check is enabled by default in *Defend > Compliance > Hosts* in the *Default - alert on critical and high* rule.

image::host_runtime_update_compliance_check.png[width=700]

The security updates tab shows pending security updates (based on a new compliance check that was added for this purpose).
Supported for Ubuntu and Debian

Add a routine to periodically check for unattended security updates (run every 24 hours).
Check for pending security updates-


The host incidents are of the following types: Crypto miner, Malware downloaded, Suspicious ELF header, Execution flow hijack attempt


=== Audits

Audits can be viewed under *Monitor > Events*.
