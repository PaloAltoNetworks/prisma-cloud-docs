== Serverless Defender as a Lambda layer

*Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender _as a Lambda layer_ is a beta feature.*

Prisma Cloud Serverless Defenders protect your serverless functions at runtime.
To secure an AWS Lambda function, embed the Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender as a layer.
Currently, Prisma Cloud supports AWS Lambda functions.

Serverless Defenders monitor your functions to ensure they execute as designed.
Per-function policies let you define:

* Block all processes except main process
Automatically prevents all unknown software, not started by the original genuine function, from running

* Process whitelists and blacklists.
Enables verification of launched subprocesses against policy.

* Outgoing connections whitelists and blacklists.
Enables verification of domain name resolution against policy for outgoing network connections.


=== Sample function

You can use the following Python 3.6 sample function to test Prisma Cloud's Serverless Defender.
The function is set up to be easily exploited with a command injection attack.

The function reads the request body.
If the request body is empty, it returns a response of OK.
If the request body contains data, the data is assumed to be a shell command, and it's summarily executed as a child program in a new process.

[source,python]
----
import subprocess
import os
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Read the request body.
    if "body" in event:
        cmd = event["body"]
    else:
        cmd = None

    # Prepare the default response.
    response = {
      "isBase64Encoded": False,
      "statusCode": 200,
      "headers": {"Content-Type": "text/plain"},
      "body": "OK\n"
    }

    # If the request body contains a string,
    # execute it as a command in a new process.
    if cmd is not None:
        try:
            p = subprocess.Popen(cmd.split(" "), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
            out, _ = p.communicate()
            out = out.decode("utf8")
        except Exception as e:
            out = str(e)

        response['body'] = out

    return response

=== Upload the Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender layer to AWS

Download the Serverless Defender layer from Prisma Cloud Console, then add it to the AWS Lambda service as a resource available to all functions.

[.procedure]
. Download the layer from Prisma Cloud Console:

.. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy*.

.. Choose the DNS name or IP address that Serverless Defender uses to connect to Console.

.. Set the Defender type to *Serverless*.

.. For *Deployment Type*, select *Layer*.

.. Click *Download Prisma Cloud Layer*, and a ZIP file is downloaded to your host.
+

. Upload the layer to the AWS Management Console:

.. Go to the Lambda service. 

.. Click *Layers*.
+
image::serverless_layer_layers.png[width=250]

.. In *Name*, enter *twistlock*.

.. Click *Upload*, and select the file you just downloaded, __twistlock_layer_<VERSION>.zip__

.. Select the compatible runtimes: *Python 3.6* and *Node.js 10.x*.

.. Click *Create*.
+
image::serverless_layer_create.png[width=700]


[.task]
=== Create an AWS Lambda function

Create an AWS Lambda function.
This section is geared to setting up the sample function.
If you've already got your own function, verify that it satisfies the prerequisites, then proceed to the next section.

*Prerequisites:*

* Your function is written for Node.js 10.x or Python 3.6.
* Your function's execution role grants it permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.

[.procedure]
. Log into the AWS Management Console.

. Go to *Services > Compute > Lambda*.

. Click *Create function*.

.. Select *Author from scratch*.

.. Enter a function name.

.. Select a runtime.
If you're using the sample function, select Python 3.6.

.. Select a role.
+
Prisma Cloud Serverless Defender requires permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.
Attach the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole to the role you create for your Lambda function.
The AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole only grants permission to write to CloudWatch Logs.
You will need to extend this policy if your Lambda function accesses other AWS resources.

.. Click *Create function*

. (Optional) If you're using the provided sample function, paste it into the code window, then click *Save*.


[.task]
=== Embed the Serverless Defender

Secure your function by embedding the the Serverless Defender as a layer.

[.procedure]
. Go to the function designer in the AWS Management Console.

. Click on the *Layers* icon.
+
image::serverless_layer_function_designer_layers.png[width=250]

. In the *Referenced Layers* panel, click *Add a layer*.
+
image::serverless_layer_add_a_layer.png[width=700]

.. In the *Select from list of runtime compatible layers*, select *twistlock*.

.. In the *Version* drop-down list, select *1*.

.. Click *Add*.
+
image::serverless_layer_add_a_layer2.png[width=700]
+
When you return to the function designer, you'll see that your function now uses one layer.
+
image::serverless_layer_function_designer_layers2.png[width=250]

. . On line 1 of your function code, enter the following line:

  import twistlock

. Click *Save* to preserve all your changes.
+

[.task]
=== (Optional) Exercise the sample function

If you're using the sample function, trigger it to run with a test event.
The sample function takes the contents of the request body and executes it as a shell command.
This test event sends a request with the */bin/ls* command.

It's worth setting up a test event so that can you see how the function runs with and without a Prisma Cloud policy in place.

[.procedure]
. With the function designer open in the AWS Management Console, select *Configure test events*.
+
image::serverless_layer_test_event.png[width=500]

.. Select *New test event*.

.. Enter an event name, such as *TestProcess*.

.. In the code window, enter */bin/ls /"*

.. Click *Create*.
+
image::serverless_layer_test_event2.png[width=600]

. Back in the function designer, run the test by clicking on *Test*.
+
image::serverless_layer_run_test.png[width=500]

. The execution result shows a file listing for the functions root file system.
+

[.task]
=== Define a policy

Policies are defined in Prisma Cloud Console and then injected into your function as an environment variable.

This step shows you how to secure your function against command injection.
Create a new rule in Prisma Cloud Console that prevents all processes, besides the main process, from running.
By default, new rules apply to all functions (`*`), but you can target them to specific functions using xref:../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc#[pattern matching].
If you've got your own function, configure the rule to meet your own specific objectives.

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Defend > Runtime > Serverless Policy*.

. Click *Add rule*.

.. In the *General* tab, enter a rule name.

.. Click the *Processes* tab.

.. Set *Effect* to *Prevent*.
+
To explicitly whitelist or blacklist specific processes, set *Block all processes except main process* to *Off*.

.. Click *Save*.

. Get a copy of the policy.

.. In the *Actions* menu for the rule you just created, click *Copy as Text*.
+
image::serverless_layer_copy_rule.png[width=700]

. Go to the function designer in the AWS Management Console.

. In the *Environment variables* panel:

.. For *Key*, enter *TW_POLICY*.

.. For *Value*, paste the rule you copied from Prisma Cloud Console.

. Click *Save*.


[.task]
=== (Optional) Exercise the sample function again

With the policy in place, trigger the function with your test event.
This time, Serverless Defender blocks the command injection.

[.procedure]
. Go the function designer in the AWS Management Console.

. In the *Select a test event...* drop-down list, select the test event you previously configured (*TestProcess*).

. Click *Test*.
+
image::serverless_layer_run_test.png[width=500]

. Serverless Defender blocks the *ls* process from running. 
+
image::serverless_layer_execution_result2.png[width=500]

. Validate your setup.

.. View the audit in the CloudWatch logs.
Click *Monitoring*, then click *View logs in CloudWatch*.

.. View the audit in Prisma Cloud Console
Go to *Monitor > Events > Serverless Audits*.
