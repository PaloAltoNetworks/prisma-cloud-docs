Almost all Defender types can be auto-upgraded.
Only App-Embedded Defenders must be upgraded manually.

Both App-Embedded and Serverless Defenders are backwards compatible with newer versions of Console.
However, as a best practice, always upgrade them when Console is upgraded.
App-Embedded Defenders whose versions are out of sync with Console's version will continue to interoperate with Console, but some operations might be restricted, such as reconfiguring policy rules.

Incompatible Defenders can cause severe service disruptions such as disconnection from the upgraded Console, frozen runtime security of the environment (as new policies can't be applied), Defender container panics, excessive alerts, and so on.
The Defender auto-upgrade process ensures that there is no such impact caused by incompatibility between Console and Defenders when Console is upgraded.
With this process, Defenders are always maintained in a supported and compatible state without any user intervention required.

The following table summarizes the Defender types, and which ones are auto-upgraded.
