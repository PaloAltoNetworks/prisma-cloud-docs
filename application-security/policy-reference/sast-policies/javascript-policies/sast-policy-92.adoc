=== Description

This SAST policy detects the usage of the Express framework without the Helmet framework for protection against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const express = require('express');
----

The above code is vulnerable because it initializes the Express framework without using the Helmet framework for securing against XSS attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, the code should be modified to include the Helmet framework for XSS protection. 

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

app.use(helmet());
----

The secure code includes the Helmet framework by requiring it and using it with the Express framework. This way, the application is protected against XSS attacks.
