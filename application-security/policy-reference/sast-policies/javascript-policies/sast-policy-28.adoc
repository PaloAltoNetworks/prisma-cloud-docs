=== Description

This policy aims to prevent the misuse of Connect's `methodOverride` middleware by ensuring that `csrf` middleware is used before `methodOverride`. When using Connect, the order in which middlewares are declared determines their execution stack. If `methodOverride` is used before `csrf`, it may allow attackers to bypass standard CSRF protection mechanisms in Connect.

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.methodOverride());
app.use(express.csrf());
// other middleware and routes
----

In this example, the `methodOverride` middleware is used before `csrf`, which creates a security risk.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To resolve this issue, ensure that the `csrf` middleware is declared before the `methodOverride` middleware.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.csrf());
app.use(express.methodOverride());
// other middleware and routes
----

By ensuring that `csrf` middleware is used before `methodOverride`, the application reduces the risk of CSRF
