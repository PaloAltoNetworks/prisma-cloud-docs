|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects the use of unsecured HTTP connections in JavaScript. Unsecured connections, such as those that start with "http://", can expose sensitive data to potential eavesdroppers or malicious entities. It's crucial to use HTTPS, which encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Specific patterns this policy checks for include:
- Use of `axios` functions like `get`, `post`, `delete`, `put`, `patch`, `options`, and `create` with unsecured URLs.
- Use of the `fetch` function with unsecured URLs.
- Creation of axios instances with a base URL that starts with "http://".

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
axios.get('http://example.com/data');
----

or 

[source,javascript]
----
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://example.com'
});
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To address this security concern, always use HTTPS for making HTTP requests. Replace "http://" with "https://" in your URLs to ensure the data transmission is encrypted.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
axios.get('https://example.com/data');
----

In the corrected example, a secure HTTPS connection is used, ensuring that the data is encrypted during transmission and protecting it from potential threats.
