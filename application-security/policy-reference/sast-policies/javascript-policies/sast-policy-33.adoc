|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects the use of encryption keys with inadequate size in JavaScript. Encryption keys with a size less than 16 bytes may pose a risk of being brute-forced, leading to vulnerabilities like unauthorized access or data breaches.

Some common patterns this policy checks for include the usage of:
- `nacl.randomBytes`
- `randomBytes` from either the `randombytes` module or `node:crypto`
- `getBytesSync` from `node-forge`
- `cryptoRandomString` and `cryptoRandomStringAsync`
- `brorand.Rand` instances

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
const nacl = require('tweetnacl');
const key = nacl.randomBytes(8);
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, always use encryption keys that are at least 16 bytes in length. This ensures a higher degree of encryption strength, making brute-force attacks significantly more challenging.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
const nacl = require('tweetnacl');
const key = nacl.randomBytes(16);
----

In this example, an encryption key of the recommended size (16 bytes) is generated, ensuring adequate cryptographic strength.
