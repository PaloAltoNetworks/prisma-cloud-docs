|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects the use of express.csrf() middleware before express.methodOverride(). This can allow GET requests (which are not checked by csrf) to turn into POST requests later.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
app.use(express.csrf());
app.use(express.methodOverride());
----

The above code is vulnerable because it uses the `express.csrf()` middleware before `express.methodOverride()`. This means that GET requests, which are not checked by CSRF protection, can later be turned into POST requests.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, the `express.methodOverride()` middleware should be used before the `express.csrf()` middleware.

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
app.use(express.methodOverride());
app.use(express.csrf());
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it uses the `express.methodOverride()` middleware before the `express.csrf()` middleware. This ensures that POST requests are not created from GET requests without proper CSRF protection.
