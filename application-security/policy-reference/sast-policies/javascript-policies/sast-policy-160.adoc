=== Description

This policy detects information exposure through an error message. If the code contains a pattern that matches either `console.trace(<ANY>)` or a `try-catch` block with a function containing one of the following methods: `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, `alert`, `prompt`, or `confirm`, and the catch block includes a variable `$ERR` or a variable that contains sensitive information such as `message`, `stack`, `status`, or `name`, then it is considered a vulnerability.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
```
console.trace('Error message containing sensitive information');
```

The above code is vulnerable because it directly exposes sensitive information through the `console.trace` method.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, avoid printing sensitive information directly in error messages. Instead, modify the error handling logic to handle sensitive information securely.

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
```
throw new Error('An unexpected error occurred');
```

In the secure code example, the error message does not contain any sensitive information. The code throws a generic error message to avoid exposing any internal details about the error.

By following this approach, sensitive information is not leaked through error messages, improving the overall security of the application.
