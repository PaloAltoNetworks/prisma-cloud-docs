=== Description

In web applications, the `postMessage` method and the `addEventListener` for `message` events are used to facilitate cross-origin communication. When misconfigured, these can lead to security vulnerabilities such as data leakage or unauthorized actions.

One common vulnerability arises when using the wildcard origin (`*`) with the `postMessage` method. This allows any website to receive the message, potentially leading to sensitive information being exposed.

Similarly, not verifying the origin of the message in an `addEventListener` handler can lead to processing messages from malicious sources.

For example, vulnerable code might look like:

[source,javascript]
----
window.contentWindow.postMessage(data, '*');
window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    // Process event.data without verifying event.origin
}, false);
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To address this vulnerability:

1. Never use a wildcard origin (`*`) with `postMessage`. Always specify the exact target origin you intend to communicate with.
2. Always check the `event.origin` in your `message` event handlers to ensure the data is coming from a trusted source.

A more secure example would be:

[source,javascript]
----
const trustedOrigin = 'https://trusted.com';

window.contentWindow.postMessage(data, trustedOrigin);
window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    if (event.origin !== trustedOrigin) return;
    // Process event.data after verifying event.origin
}, false);
----

By following these practices, you can ensure that your cross-origin communication is secure, and you're only processing messages from trusted sources.
