|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects if a superuser port is set in the code. Superuser ports are reserved for privileged services and should not be used by regular applications. Using a superuser port could potentially lead to an authentication bypass vulnerability.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const app = express();
app.listen(80);
----

The above code is vulnerable because it sets the port to a superuser port (port 80), which is reserved for privileged services. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, the application should use a non-superuser port for communication.

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const app = express();
app.listen(3000);
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it sets the port to a non-superuser port (port 3000). Using a non-privileged port ensures that the application follows best practices and mitigates the risk of an authentication bypass.
