=== Description


Flag any custom classes that extend the `java.security.MessageDigest` class. `MessageDigest` is a Java class used for calculating message digests, also known as checksums or cryptographic hash functions. By extending `MessageDigest`, a developer could be creating a custom cryptographic hash function, which is generally considered error-prone and a bad practice. 

Cryptography is a complex field and implementing a secure and reliable cryptographic hash function requires specific expertise. Improperly implemented hash functions can have vulnerabilities that can be exploited, leading to significant security risks.

Example of violating code:

[source,java]
----
import java.security.MessageDigest;

public class CustomDigest extends MessageDigest {
    public CustomDigest() {
        super("CustomDigest");
    }

    // ... custom implementation ...
}
----

In the example above, a custom `MessageDigest` is being created, which would be flagged.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you should use a standard, widely accepted and tested cryptographic hash function instead of creating a custom one. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends the use of SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, or SHA-512/256.

Example of fixed code:

[source,java]
----
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");

        // ... usage of standard SHA-256 MessageDigest ...
    }
}
----

In the fixed code, instead of creating a custom `MessageDigest`, the code uses the built-in `SHA-256` MessageDigest provided by Java's `java.security` package, which is a secure and tested cryptographic hash function.
