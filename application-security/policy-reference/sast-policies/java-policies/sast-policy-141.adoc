=== Description

This policy detects the usage of a permissive cross-domain policy with untrusted domains. It verifies if the code contains a vulnerable pattern in which the HttpServletRequest object is used to obtain a parameter value, and the HttpServletResponse object is used to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. 

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
String origin = request.getParameter("origin");
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
----

The above code is vulnerable because it does not properly validate and sanitize the "origin" parameter obtained from the HttpServletRequest object. This lack of validation allows an attacker to provide a malicious value for the "origin", potentially enabling cross-domain requests from untrusted domains.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, the code should properly validate and sanitize the "origin" parameter before setting it as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. This can be done by using a whitelist of trusted domains and ensuring that the provided "origin" value is present in the whitelist.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
String origin = request.getParameter("origin");
if (isValidOrigin(origin)) {
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
} else {
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://trusted-domain.com");
}
----

In the secure version of the code, the "origin" parameter is checked against a list of trusted domains using the isValidOrigin() function. If the "origin" is found in the whitelist, it is set as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Otherwise, a default trusted domain is used instead. This ensures that only trusted domains are allowed for cross-domain access, mitigating the risk of data theft and spoofing.
