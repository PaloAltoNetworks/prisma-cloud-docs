=== Description

This policy detects instances where the network communications for Hazelcast is configured to use a deprecated symmetric cipher, leading to inadequate encryption strength.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
NC.setSymmetricEncryptionConfig(SEC);
----

The code above sets the symmetric encryption configuration for the network communications in Hazelcast. However, it uses a deprecated symmetric cipher, which is considered to have inadequate encryption strength.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, you should consider using TLS/SSL when establishing communications across the Hazelcast cluster, instead of the deprecated symmetric cipher.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
NC.setSSLConfig(SSL);
----

By setting the SSL configuration (using TLS/SSL) for the network communications in Hazelcast, you ensure a stronger and more secure encryption mechanism. This eliminates the use of the deprecated symmetric cipher and improves the encryption strength.
