|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects cases where SAML's XML parsing is not properly authenticated, which can allow attackers to manipulate the XML comments and bypass security checks.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
BasicParserPool $POOL = new BasicParserPool(<ANY>);
$POOL.parse(<ANY>);
----

The above code is vulnerable because it creates a BasicParserPool object without invoking the `setIgnoreComments(true)` method. This means that if the XML contains malicious comments, they can be manipulated by attackers to disrupt attestation fields and bypass security checks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, invoke the `setIgnoreComments(true)` method on the BasicParserPool object.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
BasicParserPool $POOL = new BasicParserPool(<ANY>);
$POOL.setIgnoreComments(true);
$POOL.parse(<ANY>);
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it properly sets the `setIgnoreComments` property of the BasicParserPool object to true. This ensures that any XML comments included in the parsing process will be ignored, preventing attackers from manipulating them to bypass security checks.
