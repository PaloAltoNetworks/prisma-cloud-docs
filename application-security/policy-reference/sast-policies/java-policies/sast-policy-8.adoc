=== Description

This SAST policy detects code that may allow access to restricted files or directories by external parties. Specifically, it looks for the usage of the `org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView` class and `HttpRequest.getRequestDispatcher()`'s `include` and `forward` methods that are called with user-supplied input. 

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping(value="/mvc", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public ModelAndView mvc(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model)
{
  // Get user input
  String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
  // Use user input directly to resolve a view
  return new ModelAndView(userInput);
}
----

The above code is vulnerable because it takes user-supplied input (`userInput`) and directly uses it to resolve a view without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially allow an attacker to access restricted views that they are not supposed to have access to.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the vulnerability, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the user-supplied input before using it to resolve a view. One approach is to use a lookup table or data source to map the user input to a specific view. Here is an example of how to fix the code:

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping(value="/mvc", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public ModelAndView mvc(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model)
{
  // Create a lookup table or pull from a data source
  HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
  lookupTable.put("key1", "view1");
  lookupTable.put("key2", "view2");
  
  // Get user input
  String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
  
  // Look up view from the user input
  String viewValue = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, userInput);
  
  // Return the new model and view
  return new ModelAndView(viewValue);
}
----

In the fixed code, a lookup table is used to map the user input to a specific view. This ensures that only valid and authorized views are accessible, preventing unauthorized access to restricted views.
