=== Description


This policy highlights the issue of storing sensitive information or session-related data in a cookie. Cookies are susceptible to a variety of attacks (such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)), and sensitive data stored in them can potentially be exposed to unauthorized actors. It's best practice to only store non-sensitive data in cookies, and keep sensitive or session-related data server-side, associated with the session ID stored in the cookie.

An example of violating code could look like this:

[source,java]
----
import javax.servlet.http.Cookie;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.jws.WebMethod;

public class SensitiveCookieHandler {
    @WebMethod
    public void handleCookies(HttpServletRequest request) {
        for (Cookie cookie : request.getCookies()) {
            String cookieName = cookie.getName();
            String cookieValue = cookie.getValue();
            String cookiePath = cookie.getPath();
            // Sensitive information is being accessed from the cookies
            System.out.println("Cookie name: " + cookieName);
            System.out.println("Cookie value: " + cookieValue);
            System.out.println("Cookie path: " + cookiePath);
        }
    }
}
----

This code is problematic because it implies that sensitive information is stored in cookies, which is then accessed and potentially used or exposed. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this violation, you should avoid storing sensitive data in cookies and keep it on the server side instead. Cookies should only be used to store session IDs or non-sensitive data. Here's how the revised code might look:

[source,java]
----
import javax.servlet.http.Cookie;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import javax.jws.WebMethod;

public class SensitiveSessionHandler {
    @WebMethod
    public void handleSession(HttpServletRequest request) {
        HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
        for (Cookie cookie : request.getCookies()) {
            String cookieName = cookie.getName();
            // Only session IDs or non-sensitive data should be accessed from the cookies
            if (cookieName.equals("sessionID")) {
                session.setAttribute("sessionID", cookie.getValue());
            }
        }
    }
}
----

In this revised code, sensitive data is stored in the session (server side) instead of in the cookies. The cookies are only used to store and retrieve the session ID.
