=== Description

This SAST policy detects the usage of unencrypted payloads with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). 

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
com.auth0.jwt.algorithms.Algorithm.none()
----
                
The above code is vulnerable because it uses the `com.auth0.jwt.algorithms.Algorithm.none()` method to create a JWT algorithm that does not encrypt the payload. This means that the contents of the token can be easily read and manipulated by attackers.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, the payload of the JWT should be encrypted using a secure cryptographic algorithm.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
com.auth0.jwt.algorithms.Algorithm.HMAC256("your-secret")
----
                
The above code is no longer vulnerable because it uses the `HMAC256` algorithm to encrypt the JWT payload with a secure secret key. This ensures that the payload is protected and cannot be easily tampered with by attackers.
