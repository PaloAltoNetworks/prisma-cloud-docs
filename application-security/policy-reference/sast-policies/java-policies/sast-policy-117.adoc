=== Description

This policy detects when a file is opened to read its content, and the filename comes from an input parameter. If an unfiltered parameter is passed to this file API, it could lead to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing files from an arbitrary filesystem location to be read.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
String filename = request.getParameter("filename");
File file = new File(filename);
FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(file);
----

In the above code, the `filename` parameter is directly used to create a `File` object and a `FileReader` object without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `filename` parameter and potentially read files from any location on the filesystem.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, it is important to validate and sanitize the `filename` parameter before using it to create a `File` object. One approach is to define a whitelist of allowed filenames or restrict the file's location to a specific directory.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
String filename = request.getParameter("filename");
// Validate filename to ensure it is not malicious
if (isValidFilename(filename)) {
    File file = new File("/path/to/allowed/directory", filename);
    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(file);
}
----

In the secure code example, the `filename` parameter is first passed through a validation function `isValidFilename()` to ensure it does not contain any malicious characters or sequences. If the filename passes the validation, it is then combined with the allowed directory path to create the `File` object. This ensures that only files within the allowed directory can be accessed, mitigating the path traversal vulnerability.
