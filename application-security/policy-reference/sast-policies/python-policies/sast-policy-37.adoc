|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects the import and usage of modules related to IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) in Python. IPMI is considered insecure due to potential cryptographic vulnerabilities, and it's recommended to use an encrypted protocol in its place.

Specifically, the policy checks for the import of modules such as:
- pyghmi
- pyIPMI
- freeIPMI
- ipmi-utils
- pyIPMItool
- python-ipmi
- ipmi

Example of violating code:

[source,python]
----
import pyghmi.session
----

or 

[source,python]
----
from pyIPMI import session
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To address this issue, refrain from using IPMI-related modules in your codebase. Instead, opt for secure and encrypted protocols or libraries that offer a higher level of security.

Consider researching and identifying an appropriate encrypted alternative that fits your application's requirements.
