=== Description

This policy detects the use of vulnerable functions in Python code that can lead to improper access control. The specific vulnerable functions it looks for are `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler` and `twisted.web.twcgi.CGIDirectory`.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
import wsgiref.handlers

def some_function():
    handler = wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler()  # This code violates the policy
    # Rest of the code
----

The above code is vulnerable because it uses the `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler` function, which is susceptible to improper access control issues.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, you should avoid using the vulnerable functions and instead use secure alternatives or implement proper access control mechanisms.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
import http.server

def some_function():
    handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler()  # This code is no longer vulnerable
    # Rest of the code
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it uses the secure `http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` function instead of the vulnerable `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`. This ensures proper access control and reduces the risk of security implications.
