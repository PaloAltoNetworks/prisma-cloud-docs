=== Description

Utilizing weak or deprecated cryptographic algorithms poses a threat by exposing sensitive information to unnecessary vulnerabilities. This policy pinpoints the uses of outdated or insecure cryptographic algorithms that are considered unsafe and thus not recommended. 

When weak algorithms are in play, it can result in:

1. Exposed sensitive information.
2. Greater susceptibility to brute-force attacks.
3. The potential for revealing system configurations or secrets.

In the observed codebase, cryptography is performed with algorithms that are deprecated or considered as risky. Leveraging these algorithms is a crucial security misconfiguration that can expose applications to threats.

Avoid practices like:

[source,python]
----
# Using Cryptodome library with DES (not recommended)
import Cryptodome.Cipher.DES as DES
cipher = DES.new(YOUR_KEY)
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this:

1. Transition to cryptographic algorithms that have been approved and are recognized as secure.
2. Avoid the use of deprecated or known insecure cryptographic algorithms.
3. Regularly audit and update cryptographic libraries and methods to follow the best and updated security practices.

For instance:

[source,python]
----
# Using Cryptodome library with AES (recommended)
from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES
cipher = AES.new(YOUR_KEY)
----

Always remain updated with the advancements in cryptography to combat potential risks.
