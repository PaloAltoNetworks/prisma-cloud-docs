=== Description

This policy detects instances where unvalidated user input is written into a JSON object. Writing unvalidated input into JSON can enable attackers to inject malicious elements, potentially leading to security breaches, data corruption, and unauthorized access.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
import json

user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
data = {'name': user_input}

json.dump(data)
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you should validate and sanitize any user input before writing it into a JSON object. This involves ensuring that the input follows expected format and does not contain any malicious elements.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
import json

user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
sanitized_input = user_input.strip()  # Sanitize input by removing leading/trailing white spaces

data = {'name': sanitized_input}

json.dump(data)
----
