=== Description

Secure Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol versions are crucial for encrypting communications over networks. However, not all versions of the protocol maintain a high level of security. The use of insecure TLS protocol versions can leave applications vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers can intercept and decipher the communication.

In the analyzed codebase, configurations were discovered that make use of insecure or outdated TLS protocol versions. Leveraging these older versions poses security risks and can expose sensitive data.

For example:

[source,python]
----
# Using OpenSSL with SSLv3 (not recommended)
import OpenSSL
context = OpenSSL.SSL.Context(OpenSSL.SSL.SSLv3_METHOD)
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To ensure robust encryption:

1. Transition to using secure TLS protocol versions such as TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.
2. Ensure that any third-party libraries or services also use secure protocol versions.
3. Regularly review and update configurations to reflect the latest security standards and practices.

A safer configuration example:

[source,python]
----
# Using AWS CDK for OpenSearchService with a secure TLS policy
import aws_cdk.aws_opensearchservice as oss
domain = oss.CfnDomain(
    <...>,
    domain_endpoint_options=oss.CfnDomain.DomainEndpointOptionsProperty(tls_security_policy="Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07")
)
----

Maintaining updated and secure TLS configurations ensures encrypted communications remain confidential and are not vulnerable to interception or tampering.
