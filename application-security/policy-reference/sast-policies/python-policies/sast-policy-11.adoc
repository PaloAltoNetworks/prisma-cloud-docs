=== Description

This issue arises when your Python script tries to bind a socket to a port number below 1024, which are known as "privileged ports". Only root or a user with appropriate privileges can bind to these ports. This may indicate a situation where your application is running with more privileges than necessary, which is a security concern.

Here's an example of violating code:

[source,python]
----
def set_port(port):
    # some code that binds to the port

set_port(80)  # This is a privileged port
----

The code is trying to bind to port 80, which is a privileged port. This means that the script must be running with root or elevated privileges.

To fix the issue, you should avoid using privileged ports unless absolutely necessary:

[source,python]
----
def set_port(port):
    # some code that binds to the port

set_port(8080)  # This is a non-privileged port
----

In the revised code, we're using port 8080, which is a non-privileged port. The script can bind to this port without needing extra privileges. This reduces the potential security risk. If your application requires the use of privileged ports, you should consider using a reverse proxy setup, which allows the application to run without elevated privileges.
