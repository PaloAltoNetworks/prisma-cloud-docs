|=== 

=== Description

This SAST policy detects the usage of the `paramiko.client.AutoAddPolicy` with any value passed to `set_missing_host_key_policy()`. This is a vulnerability as it allows for key exchange without entity authentication, potentially allowing connections to malicious servers.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
import paramiko

client = paramiko.SSHClient()
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.client.AutoAddPolicy())
----

The above code is vulnerable because it sets the host key policy to `AutoAddPolicy()`, which implicitly trusts a server's host key without verifying it, allowing connections to malicious servers.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you should use a more secure host key policy, such as `paramiko.client.RejectPolicy()` or a custom subclass. This policy will reject connections to servers with unknown or untrusted host keys.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
import paramiko

client = paramiko.SSHClient()
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.client.RejectPolicy())
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it sets the host key policy to `RejectPolicy()`, which rejects connections to servers with unknown or untrusted host keys, preventing connections to malicious servers.
