=== Description

SSL/TLS connections are vital for ensuring secure communication over a computer network. One critical aspect of these connections is the validation of server certificates. Without proper server hostname verification, a man-in-the-middle attack becomes feasible, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt communications or even impersonate a trusted server.

The identified policy pinpoints instances where the application disables or does not correctly implement server hostname verification when establishing SSL/TLS connections. In specific, the policy focuses on instances where Python's SSL module creates an unverified or standard library context without enforcing hostname verification.

For instance:

[source,python]
----
import ssl
context = ssl._create_unverified_context()
# Vulnerable since hostnames are not verified
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

Ensure all SSL/TLS connections have hostname verification enabled. Here's how you can do it:

1. Avoid using functions like `_create_unverified_context()`, which are intended for specific scenarios where verification isn't necessary (e.g., local testing).
2. When creating SSL contexts, ensure that the `check_hostname` attribute is set to `True`.
3. Regularly review and update SSL/TLS handling libraries and configurations to ensure they align with best security practices.

An example of the correct approach would be:

[source,python]
----
import ssl
context = ssl.create_default_context()  # This context checks hostnames by default
# Further configurations can be added
----

Or, if you must use `_create_stdlib_context()` or `_create_unverified_context()`, ensure that hostname checking is explicitly turned on:

[source,python]
----
import ssl
context = ssl._create_stdlib_context()
context.check_hostname = True
----

Ensuring server hostname verification will safeguard your application against potential man-in-the-middle attacks and uphold the security and privacy of the data being communicated.
