=== Description 


It is generally a best practice to avoid using APT (Advanced Package Tool) when working with Docker containers.
This is because APT is designed to work with traditional server-based environments, and may not be well-suited for use with containers.
Using APT with Docker containers can create potential security risks, as it may allow packages to be installed that are not designed to work with containers.
This can lead to compatibility issues and potentially compromise the security of your containers.

=== Fix - Buildtime
