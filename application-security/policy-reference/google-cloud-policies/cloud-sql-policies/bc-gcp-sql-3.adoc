=== Description 


PostgreSQL does not log attempted connections by default.
Enabling the *log_connections* setting creates log entries for each attempted connection to the server, along with successful completion of client authentication.
This information can be useful in troubleshooting issues and to determine any unusual connection attempts to the server.
We recommend you set the *log_connections* database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instances to *on*.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console To change the policy using the GCP Console, follow these steps:* 



. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances [Cloud SQL Instances].

. Select the * PostgreSQL instance* for which you want to enable the database flag.

. Click * Edit*.

. Scroll down to the * Flags* section.

. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click * Add item*.

. Select the flag * log_connections* from the drop-down menu, and set the value to * on*.

. Click * Save*.

. Confirm the changes in the * Flags* section on the * Overview* page.


* CLI Command* 



. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command: `gcloud sql instances list`

. Configure the log_connections database flag for every Cloud SQL PosgreSQL database instance using the following command: `gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --database-flags log_connections=on`
+
NOTE: This command will overwrite all previously set database flags. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance;
any flag not specifically included is set to its default value.
For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign (=).se flags.
To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance.
Any flag not specifically included is set to its default value.
For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign (*=*).
