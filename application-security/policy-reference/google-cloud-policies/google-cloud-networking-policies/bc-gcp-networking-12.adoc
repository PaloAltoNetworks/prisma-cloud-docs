=== Description 


The Compute Engine instance cannot forward a packet unless the source IP address of the packet matches the IP address of the instance.
GCP will not deliver a packet with a destination IP address different to the IP address of the instance receiving the packet.
Both capabilities are required when using instances to help route packets.
To enable this source and destination IP check, disable the *canIpForward* field.
The *canIpForward* field allows an instance to send and receive packets with non-matching destination or source IPs.
We recommend the forwarding of data packets be disabled to prevent data loss and information disclosure.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console The canIpForward setting  can only be edited at instance creation time.* 


It is recommended to * delete* the instance and * create* a new one with canIpForward set to * False*.
To change the policy using the GCP Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances [VM instances].

. Select the * VM Instance* to remediate.

. Click * Delete*.

. On the * VM Instances* page, click * CREATE INSTANCE*.

. Create a new instance with the desired configuration.
+
NOTE: By default, a new instance is configured to not allow IP forwarding.



* CLI Command* 



. To * delete* an instance, use the following command: `gcloud compute instances delete INSTANCE_NAME`

. To * create* a new instance to replace it with * IP forwarding set to Off*, use the following command: `gcloud compute instances create`

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_compute_instance
* *Arguments:* can_ip_forward  By default set to false.
