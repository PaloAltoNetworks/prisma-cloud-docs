=== Description 


DNSSEC is a feature of the Domain Name System (DNS) that authenticates responses to domain name lookups.
There are several advanced DNSSEC configuration options you can use if DNSSEC is enabled for your managed zones.
These include: unique signing algorithms, denial of existence and the ability to use record types that require or recommend DNSSEC for their use.
When enabling DNSSEC for a managed zone, or creating a managed zone with DNSSEC, you can select the DNSSEC signing algorithms and the denial-of-existence type.
We do not recommend you use RSASHA1 unless you need it for compatibility reasons;
there is no security advantage to using it with larger key lengths.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_dns_managed_zone
* *Arguments:* *zone_signing_keys* - A list of Zone-signing key (ZSK) records.

Structure is documented below.
*key_signing_keys* - A list of Key-signing key (KSK) records.
Structure is documented below.
Additionally, the DS record is provided: The *key_signing_keys* and *zone_signing_keys* block supports: algorithm - String mnemonic specifying the DNSSEC algorithm of this key.
Immutable after creation time.
Possible values are ecdsap256sha256, ecdsap384sha384, rsasha1, rsasha256, and rsasha512.
