=== Description

Firewall rules setup fine grained allow/deny traffic policies to and from a virtual machine (VM).
Enabled rules are always enforced and help protect instances from unwanted traffic.
Firewall rules are defined at the network level, and only apply to the network where they are created.
While firewall rules are defined at the network level, connections are allowed or denied on a per-instance basis.
Additionally, it is possible to create firewall rules that allow ingress traffic from any source on the  internet.
This firewall rule may be useful for troubleshooting but can inadvertently allow malicious or unwanted access to your instances.
One such insecure firewall rule is for MySQL databases running on port TCP 3306.
We recommend you restrict or remove the the `0.0.0.0/0` MySQL firewall rule when you no longer need it.

=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console* 


To remove your `0.0.0.0/0` MySQL firewall rule:

. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls/list [Firewall].

. In the * Firewall rules in this project* section, use the * Filter* option and search for `Filter:0.0.0.0/0`.
+
This filter returns all public firewall rules.

. Select your public MySQL (TCP port 3306) firewall rule and then select * DELETE*.


* CLI Command* 


To delete your public MySQL firewall rule execute the following command:

[,sh]
----
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete FIREWALL-NAME
----

Replace * FIREWALL-NAME* with your target MySQL firewall rule name.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_compute_firewall
* *Field:* source_ranges


[source,go]
----
resource "google_compute_firewall" "mysql-example" {
  name    = "mysql-example"
  network = google_compute_network.default.name
  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["3306"]
  }
-  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
