=== Description 


When AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) supports a new version, you can upgrade your replication instances to it.
There are two kinds of upgrades: major version upgrades and minor version upgrades.
Minor upgrades helps maintain a secure and stable DMS with minimal impact on the replication.
For this reason, we recommend that your automatic minor upgrade is enabled.
Minor version upgrades only occur automatically if a minor upgrade replaces an unsafe version, such as a minor upgrade that contains bug fixes for a previous version.
