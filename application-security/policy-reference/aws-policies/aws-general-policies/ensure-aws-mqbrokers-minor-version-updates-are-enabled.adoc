=== Description 


When Amazon MQ supports a new version of a broker engine, you can upgrade your broker instances to the new version.
There are two kinds of upgrades: major version upgrades and minor version upgrades.
Minor upgrades helps maintain a secure and stable MQ broker with minimal impact on the application.
For this reason, we recommend that your automatic minor upgrade is enabled.
Minor version upgrades only occur automatically if a minor upgrade replaces an unsafe version, such as a minor upgrade that contains bug fixes for a previous version.
