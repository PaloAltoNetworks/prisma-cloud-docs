=== Description

Enforcing Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in your AWS CloudFront response header policy can help to improve the security of your website or application.
HSTS is a security feature that tells web browsers to only communicate with a website using secure HTTPS connections, rather than insecure HTTP connections.
This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other types of vulnerabilities that could be exploited over an unencrypted connection.
