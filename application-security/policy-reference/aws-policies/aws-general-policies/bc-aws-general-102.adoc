=== Description 


This is a simple check to ensure that the DocDB is using AWS key management - KMS to encrypt its contents.
To resolve add the ARN of your KMS or link on creation of the cluster.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_docdb_cluster
* *Arguments:* kms_key_id - (Optional) The ARN for the KMS encryption key.
When specifying kms_key_id, storage_encrypted needs to be set to true.
