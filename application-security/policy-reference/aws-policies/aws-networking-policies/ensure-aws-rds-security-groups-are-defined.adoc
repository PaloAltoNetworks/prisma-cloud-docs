=== Description 


By ensuring that AWS RDS security groups are defined, you can help protect your instances from unauthorized access and ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed to reach your instances.
This can help prevent data breaches and other security incidents, and can also help ensure that your instances are not overwhelmed by unwanted traffic.
