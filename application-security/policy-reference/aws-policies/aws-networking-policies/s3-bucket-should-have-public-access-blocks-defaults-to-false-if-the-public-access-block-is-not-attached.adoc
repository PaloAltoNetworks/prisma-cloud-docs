=== Description 


When you create an S3 bucket, it is good practice to set the additional resource  *aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block* to ensure the bucket is never accidentally public.
We recommend you ensure S3 bucket has public access blocks.
If the public access block is not attached it defaults to False.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket, aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block
* *Arguments:* block_public_acls and block_public_policy

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket_good_1" {
