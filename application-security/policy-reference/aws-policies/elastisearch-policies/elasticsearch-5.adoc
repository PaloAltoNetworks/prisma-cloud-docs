=== Description 


The AWS Elasticsearch Service allows you to host sensitive workloads with node-to-node encryption using Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all communications between instances in a cluster.
Node-to-node encryption ensures that any data sent to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain over HTTPS remains encrypted in-flight while it is being distributed and replicated between the nodes.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


To enable the feature, you must create another domain and migrate your data.
Using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Navigate to the * Analytics* section, select * Elasticsearch Service*.

. To enable _node-to-node encryption_ when you configure a new cluster, select * Node-to-node encryption*.
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain 
* *Argument:* Properties.NodeToNodeEncryptionOptions.Enabled
