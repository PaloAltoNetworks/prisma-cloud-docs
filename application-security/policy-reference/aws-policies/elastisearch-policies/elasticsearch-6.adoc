=== Description 


Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) allows you to build applications without setting up and maintaining your own search cluster on Amazon EC2.
Amazon ES you can configure your domains to require HTTPS traffic, ensuring that communications between your clients and your domain are encrypted.
We recommend you configure the minimum required TLS version to *accept*.
This option is a useful additional security control to ensure that your clients are not misconfigured.
