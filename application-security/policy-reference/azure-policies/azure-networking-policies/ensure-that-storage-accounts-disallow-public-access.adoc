=== Description 


As a best practice, do not allow anonymous/public access to blob containers unless you have a very good reason.
Instead, you should consider using a shared access signature token for providing controlled and time-limited access to blob containers. 'Public access level' allows you to grant anonymous/public read access to a container and the blobs within Azure blob storage.

By doing so, you can grant read-only access to these resources without sharing your account key, and without requiring a shared access signature.

=== Fix - Runtime


* In Azure Console* 



. Log in to the Azure portal

. Navigate to 'Storage Accounts'

. Select the reported storage account

. Under 'Blob service' section, Select 'Containers'

. Select the blob container you need to modify

. Click on 'Change access level'

. Set 'Public access level' to 'Private (no anonymous access)'

. Click on 'OK'
