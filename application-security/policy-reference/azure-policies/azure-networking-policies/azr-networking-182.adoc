*Description*

Virtual Networks (VNETs) in Azure are responsible for routing network traffic. For tasks like domain name resolution, DNS servers are used. However, if there's only a single DNS server associated with a VNET, it may introduce a single point of failure where the DNS IP address is not load-balanced. To avoid this single point of failure and potential network disruptions, it's recommended to have at least two DNS servers connected to your VNET.

This policy checks that the Azure Virtual Network has at least two connected DNS endpoints.
