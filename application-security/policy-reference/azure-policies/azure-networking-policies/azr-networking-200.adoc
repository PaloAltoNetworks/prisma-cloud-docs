*Description*

Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. Content Delivery Network (CDN) provides developers with a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content by caching blobs and static content of compute instances at physical nodes in the United States and internationally.

This policy ensures that the Azure CDN endpoint uses the latest version of the TLS encryption for its custom domain, helping to secure data in transit against potential man-in-the-middle attacks and vulnerabilities associated with older TLS versions.
