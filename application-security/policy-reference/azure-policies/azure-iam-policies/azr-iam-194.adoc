*Description*

Azure Event Grid Domain is a custom domain that allows sending events to a topic within the domain. Like Azure Event Grid Topics, Event Grid Domains also provide a runtime environment for sending events.

Using Managed Identities for Azure resources provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. It can be used to secure access to other Azure resources, eliminating the need for credentials in code.

This policy ensures that a managed identity provider is enabled for Azure Event Grid Domain.
