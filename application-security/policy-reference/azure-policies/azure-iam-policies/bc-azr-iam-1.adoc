=== Description 


Managed service identity in *App Service* increases security by eliminating secrets from the app, for example, credentials in the connection strings.
*App Service* provides a highly-scalable, self-patching web hosting service in Azure.
It also provides a managed identity for apps, which is a turn-key solution for securing access to an Azure SQL Database and other Azure services.
We recommend you register the *App Service* with your Azure Active Directory account ensuring the app will connect securely to other Azure services without the need of usernames and passwords.
