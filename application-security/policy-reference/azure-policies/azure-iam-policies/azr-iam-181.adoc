*Description*

Azure Data Explorer (or Kusto) is a fast and scalable data analytics service that makes it simple and cost-effective to explore and analyze all of your data. To ensure secure access to other Azure services, it's best practice to use managed identities, which offer a secure, Azure AD integrated method of authenticating to Azure services.

This policy checks that the Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) clusters are configured to use managed identities for secure access.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

*Resource:* 
- azurerm_kusto_cluster

*Argument:* 
- identity/[0]/type

[source,terraform]

resource "azurerm_kusto_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "example-cluster"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  
  # ... other configurations ...

+ identity {
+   type = "SystemAssigned"  // Use managed identity
