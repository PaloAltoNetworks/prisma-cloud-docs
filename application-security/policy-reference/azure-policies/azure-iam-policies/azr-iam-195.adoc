*Description*

Azure Event Grid Domain is a custom domain that allows sending events to a topic within the domain. It is essential for security and compliance to ensure that local authentication is disabled, especially for such a critical service.

Local Authentication, when enabled, allows access based on local identities, which can introduce potential security risks if not properly managed.

This policy ensures that local Authentication is disabled for Azure Event Grid Domain.
