*Description*

Azure SignalR Service is a managed service that allows for real-time communication using the SignalR library. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is crucial for ensuring uptime and reliability for critical applications.

Using the "Free_F1" SKU tier does not provide a business-level SLA, which can be a significant concern for applications requiring high availability and immediate support from Azure.

This policy ensures that SignalR Service instances do not use the free tier, hence ensuring a better SLA.


=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

*Resource:* 
- azurerm_signalr_service

*Arguments:* 
- sku

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_signalr_service" "example" {
  name                = "example-signalr"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

+ sku {
+   name = "Standard_S1" # or any other paid SKU
+   capacity = 1
+ }

  # ... other configurations ...
}
