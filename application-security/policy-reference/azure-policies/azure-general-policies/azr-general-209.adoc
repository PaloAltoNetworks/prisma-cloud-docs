*Description*

Azure Cognitive Search is a fully managed cloud search service that offers indexing and querying capabilities. Indexing is the process of loading content into the service to make it searchable, while querying is when a client searches for content by sending requests to the index. A crucial aspect of maintaining high performance and resilience for these processes is the configuration of multiple replicas. Replicas ensure that queries and index updates are load balanced across them, ensuring smooth operations and reduced latencies.

For maintaining consistent performance, especially in high-demand scenarios, and to uphold the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for search index queries, it's crucial to have an adequate number of replicas. Azure's SLA mandates a minimum of 2 replicas to guarantee the SLA for search index queries.

This policy validates that the Azure Cognitive Search service is configured with at least 2 replicas, ensuring the SLA for search index queries is met.

*Terraform*

*Resource:* 
- azurerm_search_service

*Arguments:* 
- replica_count

[source,terraform]
----
resource "azurerm_search_service" "example" {
  name                = "example-search-service"
  # ... other configurations ...

+ replica_count = 2

  # ... other configurations ...
}
