*Description*

The container image quarantine feature in Azure Container Registry enables you to take control over the distribution of images by quarantining them until they're verified. This is particularly important in supply chain security to ensure that only verified and scanned images are used.

This policy ensures that the quarantine policy is enabled for Azure Container Registry.
