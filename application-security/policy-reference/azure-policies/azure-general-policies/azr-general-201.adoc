*Description*

Azure Service Bus is a cloud messaging service used to connect applications, services, and devices running on Azure with on-premises software. It facilitates asynchronous, decoupled communication among decoupled components in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid solution.

This policy ensures that the Azure Service Bus data is encrypted using a customer-managed key (CMK) stored in Azure Key Vault. Utilizing a CMK offers enhanced control and transparency over the key lifecycle, and ensures that you, as the customer, maintain control of the encryption keys.
