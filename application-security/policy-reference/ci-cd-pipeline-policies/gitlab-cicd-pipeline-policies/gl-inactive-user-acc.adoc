=== Description 

A GitLab user account inactive for more than 30 days is still enabled in the system. The account can be leveraged by an adversary who has compromised the account to gain access to sensitive resources.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

We recommend removing or disabling inactive user accounts to minimize the attack and risk surface related to the GitLab workspace.
