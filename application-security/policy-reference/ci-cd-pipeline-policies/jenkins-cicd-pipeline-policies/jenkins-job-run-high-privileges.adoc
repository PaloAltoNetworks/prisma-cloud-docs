=== Description 

Each executed Jenkins job is assigned with the privileges of a Jenkins user. These privileges are used to interact with the Jenkins system, and include creating jobs, running builds, and executing on the various configured Jenkins nodes.

All jobs in the instance are configured to run with the Jenkins SYSTEM user account (that should not be confused with the operating system user). This user has high privileges over the system, and is allowed to perform any action on the Jenkins instance.

An attacker executing malicious code in any job can take advantage of these privileges and perform impactful actions on the Jenkins instance and its nodes.

For more information about access controls for builds refer to https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/build-authorization/.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Avoid running jobs with the **SYSTEM** user account, and configure a strict build authorization strategy based on the following guidelines:
 
. Install the Authorize Project plugin.
. On the Jenkins instance, under **Manage Jenkins**, browse to **Configure Global Security**.
. Under **Access Control for Builds**, set **Project default build authorization** to one of the following:
+
* **Run as Anonymous**
* **Run as User who triggered Build**
* **Run as Specific user**

. In addition, configure the **Per-project configurable Build Authorization** setting to NOT include the **Run as SYSTEM** strategy, to prevent it from being configured for specific jobs. Instead, set one or more of the options above.

NOTE: Follow the least privilege principle when configuring a job to run by a specific user.
