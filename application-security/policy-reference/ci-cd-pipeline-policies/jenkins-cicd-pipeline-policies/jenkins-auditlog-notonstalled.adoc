=== Description 

An audit log is a useful tool for monitoring and auditing, and can assist with detecting and investigating security incidents. Jenkins does not offer an audit log in its core version, while this capacity is offered by dedicated plugins. No such plugin was found installed in the Jenkins instance.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime


Install a plugin to audit actions performed on Jenkins, such as https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-trail/[Audit Trail].
