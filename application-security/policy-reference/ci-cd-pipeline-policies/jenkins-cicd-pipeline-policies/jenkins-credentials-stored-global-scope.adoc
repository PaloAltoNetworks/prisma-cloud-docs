=== Description 

By default, Jenkins credentials are stored under the global scope. Global scope credentials are accessible by all Jenkins jobs, which increases the risk of credential theft by executing a malicious job in the instance.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Avoid setting credentials with global scope. Instead, limit the scope of credentials so that the credentials are only accessible on jobs where they are required.

==== EXAMPLES

* **Limit the scope of Jenkins credentials using folder scopes**
+
 
. Install the https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-folder/[Folders] plugin. 
. Create a folder for each group of pipelines that require access to a set of credentials, and move the pipelines to the folder.
. Create the credentials and set it with the folderâ€™s scope.

* **Limit the scope of Jenkins credentials using user scopes**
+
Refer to the instructions in the following link: https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/pipelines/user-scoped-creds#_adding_user_scoped_credentials_to_your_user_account.
