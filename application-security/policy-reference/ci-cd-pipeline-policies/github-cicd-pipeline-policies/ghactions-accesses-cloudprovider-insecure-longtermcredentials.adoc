=== Description 

Long-term credentials intended to be used by GitHub Actions workflows to authenticate to a cloud provider account are stored on GitHub as a secret. This increases the impact of credential theft, since stolen credentials can be used long after a workflow run is complete.
In the GitHub Free and Teams plans, it is not possible to limit the access to stored secrets from protected branches. A secret available to a repository can be exposed by any user who has permission to modify its code.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Since October 2021, GitHub supports the OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication protocol to replace long-term credentials with short-lived access tokens.
Using OIDC, the GitHub Actions workflow can request a short-lived token directly from the cloud provider, which expires automatically as the workflow run ends.
In addition, OIDC allows more granular control over how secrets can be used. For example, it is possible to filter access to tokens when the request originates in specific protected branches or environments. For more information about using OIDC in GitHub refer to:
