=== Description 

Secrets exposed in build log files can be used by an attacker that has taken over an account with access to the system in order to move laterally in the organization. 

Exposed secrets can be caused by not using the relevant feature to protect credentials or by printing credentials in a way that bypasses the feature’s ability to detect credentials.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

When exposed credentials are found, it is recommended to rotate all exposed credentials.

By default, GitHub masks environment variables printed to the log. However the feature has limitations, hence some exposed credentials should be resolved by modifying the pipeline manifest to prevent exposure.
For GitHub’s instructions on how to mask a value printed to the log refer to: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#masking-a-value-in-log.
