=== Description 

2FA authentication is not configured for the user account. If the user's credentials are compromised, an adversary will be able to use the userâ€™s credentials to access the system.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Ensure 2FA is configured for the vulnerable user account. For additional information on configuring 2FA in GitHub, refer to: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication.
