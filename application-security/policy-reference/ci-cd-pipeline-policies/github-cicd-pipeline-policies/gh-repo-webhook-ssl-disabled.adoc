=== Description 

SSL verification is disabled for a repository webhook, which instructs GitHub to not verify the identity of the remote server.
The lack of verification enables attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and to expose the transmitted data.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

To enable SSL Verification for a webhook:

 
. Browse to the repository settings.
. Under **Webhooks**, click the relevant webhook.
. Check the **Enable SSL Verification** setting.
