=== Description 

Not verifying certificates through pipeline commands allows attackers to plant their own certificate and impersonate a server in order to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept, tamper with and/or steal information, to possibly run code in the build system and to reach the production environment.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Remove flags from the commands found in the pipeline that disable the certificate check: 

* For **wget** command remove: `--no-check-certificate`
* For **curl** command remove: `--insecure or -k flags`	

Consider removing the command entirely from the pipeline if the server certificate cannot be authenticated.
