=== Description 

In common **package.json** configurations, the **npm install** command updates and installs package versions.
**npm install**  doesn’t check for package integrity, allowing attackers who have gained control of a dependency package to upload a malicious version, which is then downloaded and installed automatically when running **npm install**.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Install NPM packages through the **npm ci** command instead of **npm install**. **npm ci** installs exact dependency versions and checksums according to the **package-lock.json** file. If package names or versions in the package-lock.json file do not match those in the package.json file, npm ci will not install the package.
