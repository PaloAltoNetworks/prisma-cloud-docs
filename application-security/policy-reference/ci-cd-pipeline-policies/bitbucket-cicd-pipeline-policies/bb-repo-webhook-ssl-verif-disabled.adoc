=== Description 

SSL verification is disabled for a repository webhook, which instructs Bitbucket to not verify the identity of the remote server.

The lack of verification can enable attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and to expose the transmitted data.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Enable SSL Verification for the webhook:
 
. Browse to the project **Settings**.
. Under **Webhooks**, select the relevant webhook.
. Uncheck the **Skip Certificate Verification** setting.
