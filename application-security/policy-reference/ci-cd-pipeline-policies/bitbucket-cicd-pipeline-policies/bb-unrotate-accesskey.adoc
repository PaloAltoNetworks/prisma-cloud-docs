=== Description 

Access keys created on Bitbucket projects were not rotated for more than 180 days. An attacker that obtains access to an access key has direct access to the repository code, and in cases where the key is assigned with **write** permissions, it grants the ability to edit it. As long as an access key exists, it increases the potential of a leaked key to be valid when used by an attacker.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

To minimize the risk of a stolen access key being used by an attacker, it is recommended to rotate access keys within a maximum period of 180 days after creating the key.
To achieve this, for each access key:
 
. Create a new private key on the server intended to use it.
. Create a new access key using the matching public key in the same project that the current key was created on.
. Direct the server to use the new key instead of the key in use.
. Delete the older access key from the Bitbucket project.

There are two options for creating and deploying keys:

* Create and delete access keys using the console: Browse to the **Access Keys** tab under the repository settings.

* Create and delete deploy keys using the API. Refer to the Bitbucket API documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_keys.html.
