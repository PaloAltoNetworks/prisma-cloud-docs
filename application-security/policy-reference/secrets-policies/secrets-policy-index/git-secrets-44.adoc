=== Description 


Personal access tokens can be an alternative to OAuth2 and used to:

* Authenticate with the GitLab API.
* Authenticate with Git using HTTP Basic Authentication.

In both cases, you authenticate with a personal access token in place of your password.
Personal access tokens are:

* Required when two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled.
* Used with a GitLab username to authenticate with GitLab features that require usernames.

For example, GitLab-managed Terraform state backend and Docker container registry,

* Similar to project access tokens and group access tokens, but are attached to a user rather than a project or group.
