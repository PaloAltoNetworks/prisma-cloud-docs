=== Description

'crates' refers to packages, and crates.io is the Rust package registry. To publish a crate to the registry, you must authenticate with an API token, which is generated via the crates.io website and saved to your local cargo configuration. This token allows you to authenticate with the crates.io server for publishing or yanking your crates, and should be kept secure.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Crates.io*

To revoke a crates.io API token:

1. Log into your account on crates.io.
2. Go to the account settings page.
3. Scroll down to the 'API Access' section where your tokens are listed.
4. Click the 'Revoke' button next to the token that you wish to revoke.

This will immediately revoke the token, and it will no longer be valid for authenticating with the crates.io API.
