=== Description 


Sentry Authentication tokens are passed using an auth header, and are used to authenticate as a user or organization account with the API.
In our documentation, we have several placeholders that appear between curly braces or chevrons, such as \{API_KEY} or which you will need to replace with one of your authentication tokens in order to use the API call effectively.
