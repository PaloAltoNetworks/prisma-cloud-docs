=== Description 


Fastly's API tokens are unique authentication credentials assigned to individual users.
You need to create an API token to use the Fastly API.
You can use API tokens to grant applications restricted access to your Fastly account and services.
For example, an engineer user could limit a token to only have access to a single service, and restrict the scope to only allow that token to purge by URL.
Every Fastly user can create up to 100 API tokens.
