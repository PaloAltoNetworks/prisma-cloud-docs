=== Description 


IBM Cloud object storage (COS) is a format for storing unstructured data in the cloud.
HMAC credentials consist of an Access Key and Secret Key paired for use with S3-compatible tools and libraries that require authentication.
The IBM Cloud Object Storage API is a REST-based API for reading and writing objects.
It uses IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management for authentication and authorization, and supports a subset of the S3 API for easy migration of applications to IBM Cloud.
