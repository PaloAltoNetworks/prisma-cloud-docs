=== Description

A SendinBlue Key, also known as an API Key, is a unique identifier used to authenticate your account when making requests to the SendinBlue API. This key allows you to use SendinBlue's services such as sending emails, managing contacts, and more, programmatically from your application. It's important to keep this key secure as it gives full access to your SendinBlue account.
