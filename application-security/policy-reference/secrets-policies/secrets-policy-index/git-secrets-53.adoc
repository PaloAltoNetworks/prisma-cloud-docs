=== Description 


Netlify provides a platform for building, deploying, and scaling websites whose source files are stored in the version control system Git and then generated into static web content files served via a Content Delivery Network.
The platform also provides services and features of serverless computing and edge computing, offering serverless functions that are version-controlled, built, and deployed alongside frontend code.
You can generate a personal access token in your Netlify user settings for manual authentication in shell scripts or commands that use the Netlify API.
If you're making a public integration with Netlify for others to enjoy, you must use OAuth2.
This allows users to authorize your application to use Netlify on their behalf without having to copy/paste API tokens or touch sensitive login info.
You'll need an application client key and a client secret to integrate with the Netlify API.
