=== Description

A Checkout.com API Public Key, also known as a Publishable Key, is used to authenticate client-side requests made to the Checkout.com API. This key is used in combination with the Secret Key to provide secure access to Checkout.com's payment services from your application. The Public Key is usually used in the checkout process to create tokens or for any action that involves direct interaction with the client. It's important to keep this key secure, although its exposure is less risky than the Secret Key, since the operations it can perform are limited.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Checkout.com*

To revoke a Checkout.com API Public Key, you'll likely need to regenerate it, which effectively revokes the old key and provides you with a new one.
