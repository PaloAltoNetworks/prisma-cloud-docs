=== Description 


Enable ActionTrail log service for all events to track and monitor all activity in your Alibaba Cloud account, including all API calls and account activity. This logging service can help to identify potential security issues or unauthorized access, and can also be useful for auditing purposes.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To enable Alibaba Cloud ActionTrail Log Services, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.

*Terraform* 




[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_actiontrail_trail" "pass" {
  trail_name         = "action-trail"
  oss_write_role_arn = "acs:ram::1182725xxxxxxxxxxx"
  oss_bucket_name    = "bucket_name"
  event_rw           = "All"
  trail_region       = "All"
}
