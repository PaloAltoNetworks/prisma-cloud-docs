=== Description 


The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol secures transmission of data between servers and web browsers, over the Internet, using standard encryption technology.
To follow security best practices and the latest PCI compliance standards, enable the latest version of TLS protocol (i.e.
TLS 1.2) as part of Alibaba Cloud Cypher policy configuration.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To enable support for the TLS v 1.2 protocol in your Alibaba Cloud Cypher policy, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.


[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_slb_tls_cipher_policy" "pass" {
  tls_cipher_policy_name = "itsfine"
  tls_versions           = ["TLSv1.2"]
  ciphers                = ["AES256-SHA","AES256-SHA256", "AES128-GCM-SHA256"]
}
