=== Description 


Allowing internet traffic to the SSH (Secure Shell) port (22) in Alibaba Cloud Security groups can pose several dangers, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. This policy identifies security groups that allow inbound traffic on SSH port (22) from the public internet.
As a best practice, restrict security groups to only allow permitted traffic and limit brute force attacks on your network.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To configure Security group rules to allow SSH access only from specific trusted IP addresses, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime. 



[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_security_group_rule" "allow_all_vncserver" {
  type              = "ingress"
  ip_protocol       = "tcp"
  nic_type          = "internet"
  policy            = "accept"
  port_range        = "5900/5900"
  security_group_id = alicloud_security_group.default.id
  cidr_ip           = "0.0.0.0/0"
