=== Description 


Alibaba Cloud OSS buckets (OSS buckets) not encrypted with a customer master key renders the bucket vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. If the bucket is accessed by an unauthorized party, the sensitive data on it can be easily compromised, leading to loss of confidentiality and integrity of the data. To prevent this risk encrypt OSS buckets with a CMK.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

Encrypt your OSS bucket by adding the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.



[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "pass" {
  bucket = "bucket-123"
  acl    = "private"

  server_side_encryption_rule {
    sse_algorithm     = "KMS"
    kms_master_key_id = "your kms key id"
  }
}
