== Risk Prevention

Risk Prevention improves engineering productivity by proactively detecting misconfigurations in the code/build phase of application development. It implements security by design, preventing potential exploits due to secrets or credentials left in the code. In addition, it secures the software supply chain with a detailed  SBOM,  and prevents malware in container images. Furthermore, it  manages and prevents open source vulnerabilities in Software Composition Analysis (SCA). Lastly, Risk Prevention ensures that CI/CD pipeline tools (such as Jenkins and CircleCI) are securely configured.
