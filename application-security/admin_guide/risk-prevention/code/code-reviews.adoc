== Code Reviews

On Prisma Cloud view insights into misconfigurations and vulnerabilities identified by default policies using Enforcement, a configuration parameter that enables you to set a custom threshold for code reviews performed on your integrated repositories.
The insights to your scan are time based; that is, you can view the latest scans or choose to navigate across the scan result history to investigate and identify any misconfigurations or violations in your repository. In addition, these insights enable you to prioritize new and existing issues identified in your repository through a graphical representation of the scan results you can search, sort and customize.

Code Reviews display the global view of all the scan results from your  integrated VCS (Version Control System) repositories and CI/CD repositories on the Prisma Cloud console. The graphical representation of the insights from the scan results helps you identify the total number of issues in a code review with the total number of failed, passed and suppressed issues. You can view up to 1000 latest scans and get insights into 20 code reviews that include all scan parameters of failed, passed and suppressed issues.
In addition, using Enforcement, a configuration for your CI/CD and VCS repositories, you are customizing your scan results to fail or pass at a specific threshold for each repository.
The tabulated insights are structured to list the latest scan first, thus enabling you to prioritize critical issues.
You can also choose to re-configure the Enforcement corresponding to the repository using Manage Enforcement.

=== Code Reviews Graph
Each time you access Code Reviews, each bar in the graph is structured to give you the total number of issues with a breakdown of Fail, Pass  and Suppressed issues in a repository.

The scan results are based on the activities performed on the default branch integrated (Master branch)  with the organization account of the VCS (Version Control System).
Using the graph you can prioritize the critical issues and identify the important repository. On every access you will be able to view upto 1000 scan results across repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
