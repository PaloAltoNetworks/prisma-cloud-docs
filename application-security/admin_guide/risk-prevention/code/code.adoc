In the modern software development landscape, code to cloud security has emerged as a critical concern. This approach focuses on securing applications from the initial code development phase to deployment and operation in the cloud environment. A significant aspect of code to cloud security is ensuring code security during the build phase, which involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and security issues before code is deployed.

* *Code Security During Build Phase*
+
Code security during the build phase is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities and weaknesses from entering the production environment. By identifying and rectifying security issues early in the development cycle, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security incidents. This proactive approach also minimizes the cost and effort required to fix vulnerabilities at later stages, where they can be more complex and expensive to address.

Prisma Cloud Application Security offers robust tools for code security during the build phase. One standout feature is its automated remediation options. These options enable developers and security teams to automatically fix common security issues identified during code scans. This helps in streamlining the development process by reducing manual intervention and accelerating the deployment of secure code.

* *Real-Time Issue Monitoring and Resolution*
+
Prisma Cloud Application Security facilitates real-time monitoring of code security across various categories. As code scans are conducted, the platform provides visibility into potential vulnerabilities, coding errors, and security weaknesses. These issues are categorized and presented in a dashboard, allowing developers and security personnel to swiftly identify critical areas that need attention.

* *Fix or Suppress Issues*
+
With Prisma Cloud Application Security, developers have the option to fix or suppress identified issues. Critical vulnerabilities can be addressed immediately, either manually or through automated remediation. For issues that may not pose an immediate risk or require further investigation, suppression allows development teams to prioritize and address them at a more convenient time, without delaying the deployment process.
