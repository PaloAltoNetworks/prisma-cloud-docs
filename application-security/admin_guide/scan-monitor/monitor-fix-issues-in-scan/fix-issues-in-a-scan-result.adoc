For issues with no fix recommendation, you can remediate it by a
*Manual Fix* or *Suppress*.

=== Manual Fix an issue

You can perform a manual fix for all issues. A manual fix enables you to access a specific commit to review the code to then resolve the issue manually using the policy guidelines on the Prisma Cloud console.
