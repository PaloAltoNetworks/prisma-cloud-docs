== Scan and Monitor

When you connect the Prisma Cloud Code Security plugins with your Version Control Systems and CI/CD platforms, every scan generates a fully contextualized Code Review scan result. The *Code Security* page shows the scan results.
The display highlights the section of the code with the error (policy violation)  and the associated metadata such as Run time and ID.
Depending on the type of scan (VCS scan or CI/CD run) and the status of a PR (latest commit/not latest/commit and PR-open/PR-closed), you will be able to perform functions such as: Suppress, Fix, Search for a specific Run or view Resource Explorer data.
