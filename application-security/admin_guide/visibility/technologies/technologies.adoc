== Technologies

*Technologies* provides a comprehensive inventory of the tools, technologies, and services in use in your software development lifecycle (SDLC). It enables you to gain visibility into your software delivery chain, detect technologies from diverse sources (even if not integrated), monitor technology transitions, reduce attack surfaces, and seamlessly integrate unincorporated technologies into Prisma Cloud. By cataloging the different components of your organization's engineering technical stack, Technologies provides valuable insights into the technologies employed throughout the SDLC.
