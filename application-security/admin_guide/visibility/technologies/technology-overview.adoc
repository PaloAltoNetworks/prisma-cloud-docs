== Technology Overview

*Technology Overview* provides an inventory of technologies in use across an organization's software development delivery lifecycle such as AWS EC2, GitHub, Jenkins and so on. In addition, Technologies lists technologies that exist but that are not integrated into the environment, or suspected traces of technologies that remain after technologies have been removed. This information provides valuable insights and allows you to identify both known and unknown technologies in the organization, monitor the transition between technologies, and reduce the attack surface of the organization by removing unused assets and integrating technologies with Prisma Cloud. In addition, Technologies enhances coverage by allowing you to properly onboard unmanaged technologies that have been identified.

NOTE: Integrating technologies in your environment not currently connected with the Prisma Cloud platform enhances your technology coverage, thereby improving your overall security posture.

To access 'Technologies', select *Application Security* > *Technologies*. The Technologies *Overview* page opens as the default view, displaying an inventory of technologies detected in the organization.

The Technology inventory includes the following details.

* *Technology*: The detected technology

* *Category*: The category that the technology is assigned to, such as VCS, CI/CD and production 

* *Source*: A list of data sources such as webhooks and applications detected in the organization, which provide evidence of the technology. See 'Source' in the the resource explorer below for more details 

* *First Detected*: When the technology was first detected

Selecting a technology in the inventory opens the resource explorer displaying additional information about the selected artifact.

* The *Overview* tab opens as the default view, providing metadata of the technology in your organization including a description, the category that the technology is classified as, when first and last detected, as well as the most recent evidence of the existence of the technology, or when evidence of a technology was removed

* *Source*: The location and details of the evidence that the technology exists or may exist, or that remnants of the technology exist in your organization. This includes information about the category that evidence is classified as, such as CI Credentials, CI Plugins, and so on, and whether the technology is connected to Prisma Cloud

=== Filters

You can apply the following filters to narrow a search for a technology:

* *Technology*: Filter by technology detected in the organization;s engineering environment

* *Category*: Filter by the environment in which the technology was detected such as CI/CD pipeline, VCS such as GitHub, production 

* *Source*: Filter by data sources which provide evidence of the technology 

* *First Detected*: Filter by date that the technology was first detected
