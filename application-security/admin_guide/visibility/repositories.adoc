== Repositories

*Repositories* provides you with a comprehensive view and analysis of your engineering technical stack from repository to deployment, all within a repository-based view. This allows you to identify code repositories and their associated infrastructure, including programming languages, frameworks, CI files and so on. In addition it allows you to understand your paths to production by identifying the repositories connected to CI/CD pipelines. 
Repositories maps your organization’s security posture, allowing you to understand the high and critical risks in your repositories. This enables you to prioritize and address the most critical security issues first, reducing the risk of security breaches. 

[NOTE]
====

* The repositories displayed in the inventory are limited to those selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, it is recommended to select all repositories during VCS onboarding

* Users will only see repositories to which they have been granted access, based on their designated roles and permissions -see xref:getting-started.adoc#manage-role-permission[Manage Roles and Permissions]for more.

=== Application Graph

You can view the repository as a graphical representation, allowing you to explore, better understand and analyze the repository assets and connections. This will allow you to get a better understanding of your technology stack, attack vectors and security posture. The development path from version control system to deployment including the different technologies, systems and configurations in the engineering environment are presented as nodes on a graph, while edges provide details of the relationship between the nodes.  
The Application Graph currently supports the following systems:
* VCS platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
* Continuous integration (CI) platforms:  Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions

To view the graph repository, select *Graph View* under the *Actions* column in the inventory table.

Graph View includes the following components:

* Graph: Displays the nodes and connections between nodes

* <<Nodes>>: The assets of a repository. Can include entities  

* <<Edges>>: The connections between nodes

* <<Graph Filters>>: Includes out-of-the-box <<Categories>> and <<Predefined Queries>>  

* <<Query Builder>>: Create custom queries  

// * <<Export>>: Download graph data as a png image or JSON file

* <<Controls>>: Includes zoom, reset and refresh buttons

==== Nodes

===== View node details


To view a node’s details, click on a node on the graph or right-click on a node > *Info*.
The Details panel opens, displaying the node’s details as well as entities grouped under the node. In addition, the node’s edges and connections to other nodes are displayed on the graph.  

===== Node Entities  

Nodes of the same type are grouped and displayed under a single group node. A number in the node indicates that the node is a group node, as well as the number of entities in the group. You can view all entities, entity details, and extract an entity from the group and display it independently on the graph.

===== Actions on Node Entities

You can perform the following actions on an entity.  

[option="header"]
|===
|Action | Steps
|*View all entities of a group node*| * Open the group node *Details* panel: Click on the group node > Select a node under the *Expanded nodes field*. The node is regrouped under the group node and is displayed under the *Collapsed node* field OR: +

* Right-click on an extracted node on the graph > *Collapse*. The entity is regrouped in the group node

|*Extract an entity from the group node*  | * Click on an entity in the *Details* panel. The selected entity moves to the *Expanded* nodes field OR: +
