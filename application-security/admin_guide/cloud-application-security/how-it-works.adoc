=== Comprehensive Visibility

Real time, ongoing, comprehensive and accurate analysis of your technical stack, visualized through the following features: 

* xref:repositories.adoc[Repositories]: A broad overview view of your organizationâ€™s assets, providing detailed analysis of all technologies, frameworks and integrations in its environment. You can see information about all your repositories, including details of their VCSs, technologies, CI/CD pipelines, and more. In addition, a summary of IaC misconfigurations, secrets exposed, SCA violations and CI/CD vulnerabilities is displayed, giving you a comprehensive and accurate view of your organization's repositories
// TODO: Link to repositories.adoc

* xref:technologies.adoc[Technologies]: An inventory of all technologies in use across your software development delivery lifecycle, such as GitHub, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS ECR, DockerHub and more. In addition you can view inventories of all the apps and webhooks, Jenkins plugins and pipeline tools detected in your environment
// TODO: Link to technologies.adoc

* xref:supply-chain.adoc[Supply Chain]: A real-time attestation of the artifacts used to build, configure and invoke cloud infrastructure, visualized as a supply chain graph, presented in a code-centric view.  The data represented in the graph reflects an opinionated supply chain attack surface of your repositories and describes how cloud infrastructure and applications can be compromised
// TODO: Link to supplychain.adoc

* xref:sbom.adoc[SBOM]: A comprehensive list of all open-source packages, third party services and tools used in the code. SBOM provides an inventory that includes both direct and indirect dependencies, providing a clear overview of all components. In addition SBOM helps you focus on vulnerable packages that can pose security risks
// TODO: Link to SBOM

* xref:code-security-dashboard.adoc[Application Security Dashboard]:The Application Security dashboard provides a unified view of the most critical application security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations detected during scans. This view provides a contextual understanding of high priority errors categorized by severity, common policy errors, licensing errors, IaC misconfigurations, CVE vulnerabilities and more 
// TODO: Link to appsec Dashboard

=== Risk Prevention

* xref:projects.adoc[Projects]: A consolidated view of results of application security scans performed by Prisma Cloud across periodic scans of default branches, CI/CD runs and pull requests. A contextual summary of all issues across code categories is displayed under *Overview*. Detailed results are categorized under IaC misconfigurations, Vulnerabilities, Secrets, and Licenses code categories  
// TODO: Link to projects.adoc

* xref:development-pipelines.adoc[Development Pipelines]: Provides a global view of all application security scan results performed across repositories with insights into misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, as well as to CI/CD runs,  identified by default policies based on pull requests (PR) and merge requests (MR)  
// TODO: Link to Development Pipeliness.adoc

* xref:ci-cd-risks.adoc[CI/CD Risks]: Displays all vulnerabilities detected in your CI/CD pipelines, including details such as the risk severity, the location and suggested remediation

=== IDE-Based Functionalities

* *Detection*: You can run automated scans through various interfaces, including a dedicated command line interface (CLI), integrated development environment (IDE), and version control system (VCS) to identify cloud infrastructure misconfigurations and vulnerabilities 

* *Remediation*: Perform code fixes and patches to address vulnerabilities and secure your code directly in your IDE environment, which provides integrated pull request comments, fixes, and smart fixes that automate the security code review process and streamline remediation efforts
