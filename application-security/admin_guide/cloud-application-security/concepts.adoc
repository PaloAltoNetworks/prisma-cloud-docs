|===
|Concept |Definition

|AppSec
|The practices and tools used to protect applications from external threats and ensure their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This includes identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in the application code, as well as ensuring that security controls are implemented throughout the application development lifecycle 

|SIP 
|Security In the Pipeline (SIP) addresses the risk of code with security flaws flowing through the pipeline, providing the most effective measures tailored to the organization stack in order to detect such issues 

|SAP
|Security Around the Pipeline (SAP) addresses the risk of the pipeline being bypassed

|SOP
|Security Of the Pipeline (SOP) addresses the security posture and the risk of security settings in pipeline systems such as the source control, CI, artifact repositories and container registries being compromised. SOP prevents the abuse of software delivery systems and processes in order to access the production environment

|Repositories
|A comprehensive view of an organization’s engineering technical stack from repository to deployment. See xref:Repositories.adoc[here] for more on Repositories

|Application Graph/ Graph View
|The organization's path to production and connectivity between artifacts, presented in graph view.  

|Technologies
|An inventory of technologies in use across your organization`’s engineering environment. Includes applications and webhooks, Jenkins plugins and pipeline tools. See xref:Technologies.adoc[here] for more on Technologies

|CI/CD pipeline
|A set of practices and tools used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software applications, facilitating the software development process

|CI/CD risks
|Risks in the CI/CD pipeline detected in the organization`’s VCS, CI and artifacts, as well as cross-system risks. See xref:CICDRisks.adoc[here] for more on CI/CD risks

|CI/CD risk categories
|Categories of CI/CD risks resulting from research into attack vectors associated with CI/CD, and the analysis of high profile breaches and security flaws as published by https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/[OWASP], allowing organizations to identify focus areas for securing their CI/CD ecosystems

|Suppress CI/CD risks
|Intentionally silence a specific warning of a risk detected in the CI/CD pipeline. This is often done when the issue is deemed low-risk or otherwise unimportant, and the developer wishes to prevent the warning or error message from appearing in future code scans or builds. See here for more on suppressing CI/CD risks

|VCS 3rd Parties
|Applications and webhooks connected to the VCS. See xref:VCS3rdParties.adoc [here] for more on VCS 3rd Parties

|Jenkins Plugins
|An inventory of Jenkins plugin instances in the system. See xref:JenkinsPlugins.adoc [here] for more on Jenkins plugins 

|Pipeline Tools
|An inventory of third party services and tools found in CI files. See xref:PipelineTools.adoc [here] for more on Pipeline tools

|Policies
|A set of rules defining the expected behavior and configurations of resources such as cloud services. Policies cover a wide range of areas such as access control, encryption and compliance

|Resource
|A resource is a Cloud Platform entity, for example, an Amazon EC2 instance, a CloudFormation stack, or an Amazon S3 bucket

|Incident
|During each scan, incidents corresponding to each instance of non-conformance to a policy in IaC, SCA, and Secrets files in buildtime environments are created

|Errors
|During each scan, errors corresponding to each instance of non-conformance to a policy in runtime environments are created.

|Suppression
|Suppression indicates that an incident is not problematic. You can Suppress an incident for all relevant resources or for a specific resource only

|Remediation
|The following types of remediation are available, depending on the type of incident : Open Jira Ticket, Run Playbook, Open Fix PR
