== Familiarize yourself with Application Security
 
// In this section, the basic concepts of Application Security are tabulated here.

//== How it Works

Application Security includes the following key functionalities:

=== Comprehensive Observability

Real time, ongoing, comprehensive and accurate analysis of your technical stack, visualized through the following features: 

* xref:repositories.adoc[Repositories]: A broad overview view of your organizationâ€™s assets, providing detailed analysis of all technologies, frameworks and integrations in its environment. You can see information about all your repositories, including details of their VCSs, technologies, CI/CD pipelines, and more. In addition a summary of IaC misconfigurations, secrets, images and CI/CD vulnerabilities is displayed, giving you a comprehensive and accurate view of your organization's repositories

* xref:technologies.adoc[Technologies]: An inventory of all technologies in use across your software development delivery lifecycle, such as GitHub, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS ECR, DockerHub and more. In addition you can view inventories of all the apps and webhooks, Jenkins plugins and pipeline tools detected in your environment
Supply Chain: A real-time attestation of the artifacts used to build, configure and invoke cloud infrastructure, visualized as a supply chain graph, presented in a code-centric view.  The data represented in the graph reflects an opinionated supply chain attack surface of your repositories and describes how cloud infrastructure and applications can be compromised

* xref:sbom.adoc[SBOM]: An inventory of all third party services and tools in the code

* xref:ci-cd-risks.adoc[CI/CD Risks]: Displays all vulnerabilities detected in your CI/CD pipelines, including details such as the risk severity, the location and suggested remediation

* xref:code-security-dashboard.adoc[Application Security Dashboard]: While Dashboards in Prisma Cloud are technically not integrated in the Application Security module user interface, the Application Security dashboard provides a unified view of the most critical  code security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations detected during scans. This view  provides a contextual understanding of high priority errors categorized by severity, common policy errors, licensing errors, IaC misconfigurations,  CVE vulnerabilities and more

=== Risk Prevention
// all items below must be linked to respective files
* Projects: A consolidated view of code security scan results performed by Prisma Cloud Code Security, categorized into the following code categories: IaC misconfigurations, Vulnerabilities, Secrets,   Licenses and CI/CD Risks, as well as details of failed CI/CD runs. A contextual summary of all issues across code categories is displayed under the Overview

* Development Pipelines: Provides a global view of all code security scan results performed across repositories with insights into misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, as well as to CI/CD runs,  identified by default policies based on pull requests (PR) and merge requests (MR)  
CI/CD Risks: Displays all vulnerabilities detected in your CI/CD pipelines, including details such as the risk severity, the location and suggested remediation

=== IDE-based Functionalities

* *Detection*: You can run automated scans through various interfaces, including a dedicated command line interface (CLI), integrated development environment (IDE), and version control system (VCS) to identify cloud infrastructure misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across IaC, SCA, Secrets and Licenses.  
Remediation. Integration with your IDEs is facilitated through the UI

* *Remediation*: The Application Security module automatically generates code fixes and patches to address vulnerabilities and secure your code. It offers integrated pull request comments, fixes, and smart fixes that automate the security code review process and streamline remediation efforts
