== Getting Started

The workflow below provides step-by-step instructions and best practices to help get up and running with Prisma Cloud’s Application Security module.
[.procedure]
. **Onboard** the Application Security platform.
.. Subscribe to the Application Security module through your Prisma Cloud CSM/CSE.
.. Assign user roles and permissions.
.. Integrate Prisma Cloud with your DevOp infrastructure which includes VCS systems such as GitHub and GitLab, CI/CD runs such as GitHub Actions and Jenkins, CI/CD systems and more.

NOTE: This guide includes appendices containing integration manuals for Jenkins Plugin and CircleCI CI/CD systems (as opposed to CI/CD runs), which are currently not covered by the Prisma Cloud documentation.

. **Investigate** the organization’s security posture resulting from the integration through the following features.
+
* Repositories: A comprehensive view of your engineering technical stack from repository to deployment through a repository-based view. 

NOTE: The repositories displayed are limited to those that you selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, we recommend selecting all repositories during VCS onboarding. In addition, only repositories that the user has been granted access to, as defined by their designated role, will be displayed.

* Projects: A view of all your code security scans across your VCS and CI/CD systems as a repository-based view, including insights into IaC, SCA, secrets and license misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Projects is out of scope for the Beta version. See Prisma Cloud documentation for more information about Projects. 

* xref:technologies.adoc[Technologies]: An inventory of technologies in use across an organization’s software development delivery lifecycle such as GitHub, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS ECR, Docker Hub, as well as third party artifacts, tools and services such as Jenkins plugins used to develop applications in your engineering ecosystem

* xref:sbom.adoc[SBOM]: An inventory of all third party services and tools in your engineering ecosystem

* xref:ci-cd-risks.adoc[CI/CD Risks]: An inventory of issues detected in your CI/CD pipeline

. Fix issues detected in a scan:

* xref:ci-cd-risks.adoc#SuggestedFix[CI/CD Risks]: Implement suggested solutions for resolving CI/CD risks 

* IaC, SCA and secrets issues: Fix issues through the **Projects** tab of Repositories.

==== Manage Roles and Permissions

The Application Security module employs a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism to regulate user access and provides support for existing various roles in Prisma Cloud within the Application Security module. The AppSec role provides admin permission on the Application Security module and read-only permission on other Prisma Cloud modules. The Developer role is limited to the Application Security module. These roles enable monitoring and securing of domains while adhering to the least permissions principle, which avoids excessive permissions on pages, actions, or other modules in the Application Security module, unless explicitly allowed.
For roles and permissions in the Application Security module, see
// add link to permissions in the admin guide
