== Getting Started

The workflow below provides step-by-step instructions and best practices to help get up and running with Prisma Cloud’s Application Security module.

[.procedure]

. **Onboard** the Application Security platform.

.. Subscribe to the Application Security module through your Prisma Cloud CSM/CSE.

.. Assign user roles and permissions.

.. Integrate Prisma Cloud with your DevOp infrastructure which includes VCS systems such as GitHub and GitLab, CI/CD runs such as GitHub Actions and Jenkins, CI/CD systems and more.

. *View* the organization’s security posture resulting from the integration through the following features.

* xref:repositories.adoc[Repositories]: A comprehensive view of your engineering technical stack from repository to deployment through a repository-based view. 
+

NOTE: The repositories displayed are limited to those that you selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, we recommend selecting all repositories during VCS onboarding. In addition, only repositories that the user has been granted access to, as defined by their designated role, will be displayed.

* xref:technologies.adoc[Technologies]: An inventory of technologies in use across an organization’s software development delivery lifecycle such as GitHub, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS ECR, Docker Hub, as well as third party artifacts, tools and services such as Jenkins plugins used to develop applications in your engineering ecosystem

* *Supply Chain*: A code-centric view of your infrastructure and application security, visualized through a supply chain graph, which provides real-time auto-discovery of potentially misconfigured infrastructure and application files
// add link to file
* xref:sbom.adoc[SBOM]: An inventory of all third party services and tools in your engineering ecosystem

* *Code Security Dashboard* A unified view of the top application security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations detected in code across all systems integrated with Prisma Cloud
// add link to file
* xref:ci-cd-risks.adoc[CI/CD Risks]: An inventory of issues detected in your CI/CD pipeline

. *Prevent* and *Fix* issues detected in a scan:
// add link to file
* *Projects*: A repository-based view of all your application security scans across your VCS and CI/CD systems, including insights into IaC misconfigurations, SCA vulnerabilities, secrets and license issues, allowing you to take remediation actions
// add link to file
* *Development Pipelines*: Find and fix issues in your pull requests and merge requests from a specific branch of a repository 
// add link to file
* xref:ci-cd-risks.adoc#SuggestedFix[CI/CD Risks]: View, assess and prioritize CI/CD risks, and implement suggested solutions for resolving CI/CD risks 

=== Organize your Workspace

Tailor  your workspace to suit your specific needs and focus on information most relevant to you. 

==== Manage Views

Customize your default screen view through the **Add View** and **Manage Views** tabs.

==== Customize Columns

Define the  columns to be displayed in the table: Select the Customize icon image:customize_icon.png next to the Search bar > select columns from the list that is displayed.  

NOTE: This feature is currently available for **Repositories**, **Technologies**, **SBOM** and **CI/CD Risks** pages.

==== Manage Roles and Permissions

The Application Security module employs a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism to regulate user access and provides support for existing various roles in Prisma Cloud within the Application Security module. The AppSec role provides admin permission on the Application Security module and read-only permission on other Prisma Cloud modules. The Developer role is limited to the Application Security module. These roles enable monitoring and securing of domains while adhering to the least permissions principle, which avoids excessive permissions on pages, actions, or other modules in the Application Security module, unless explicitly allowed.
For roles and permissions in the Application Security module, see
// add link to permissions in the admin guide
