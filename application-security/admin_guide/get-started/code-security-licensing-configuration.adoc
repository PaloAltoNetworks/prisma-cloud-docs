== Application Security Licenses

The Prisma Cloud Application Security license offering is an a la carte model that includes three modules using credits per developer. A developer as per the licensing configuration is a user who actively commits on Git, who is identified through a unique Git email address with a contribution history to any Git repositories in the last 90 days. At every stage of the Prisma Cloud licensing subscription you can choose to enable one or more modules for an enhanced Shift-left experience.

The Prisma Cloud Application Security licenses are available as a part of the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-licenses[Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition].


* *Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security*

This is current Prisma Cloud Application Security module that is renamed to IaC Security. The module offers security throughout the infrastructure lifecycle while proactively reducing the runtime risk by remediating security and compliance issues in development workflows. 
//The module now requires 3 credits per developer.

* *Software Composition Analysis (SCA)*

This module enables developers to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in open source dependencies. 
//The model requires 4 credits per developer.

* *Secrets Security*

This module scans all files to prevent  exposing API keys, passwords, certificates, tokens, and other sensitive secrets with high fidelity. To analyze your code for secrets, Prisma Cloud performs a full clone of onboarded repositories for VCS integrations and retains the data for one year.
//Added after talk with VL and TS on Sep 8, 2023.
//The module requires 1 credit per developer.

* *CI/CD Security*

This module provides continuous coverage and visibility of your engineering environment from source to deployment, allowing security teams to monitor  security across the organization without interfering with development processes, to secure your CI/CD pipelines by analyzing your attack surface, and to prioritize and offer remediation for CI/CD security risks detected in your system in order to optimize your CI/CD posture across your entire software delivery chain. 
//The module requires 2 credits per developer.

For every new and existing subscription of Application Security on Prisma Cloud, IaC Security and SCA are enabled. You can disable it on *Settings > Code Security Configuration.*

=== Configure Licensing Offerings

On the Prisma Cloud console *Settings > Code Security Configuration*, you can configure the licensing a la carte to meet your security requirements.
For an existing subscription you can switch to the new module of Application Security licensing configuration. Switching to the new module of licensing configuration ensures the credit metering to be enabled for both IaC Security and SCA modules.

Once the Application Security licensing configuration is complete you can view the license credit consumption on *Settings > Licensing > Build Time*.

For each subscription you can view the associated credit consumption.

In this example, all the Application Security subscriptions are enabled, however Secrets Scanning does not have any active credit consumption.

*Note:* If you are on a Prisma Cloud Application Security trial, you will not see credit consumption listed until your trial ends. Please work with your account team to view your current credit consumption.
