== CI/CD Systems

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your CI/CD systems in order to gain visibility into, and monitor the system technologies, configurations and pipelines that could compromise your systems. Additionally, this integration allows you to conduct security scans to detect issues like CI/CD pipeline risks, vulnerabilities, and exposed secrets in the Jenkins environment.

NOTE: The CI/CD Security module supports CI/CD systems.

The following table provides a description of the systems that currently support out-of-the-box CI/CD scanning when integrated with Prisma Cloud.
