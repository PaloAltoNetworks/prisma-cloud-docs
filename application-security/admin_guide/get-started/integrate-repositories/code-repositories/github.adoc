== Add GitHub to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Github.com allows Prisma Cloud to:

* Include your Infrastructure-as-Code files in daily scans.
* Scan changed resources in Infrastructure-as-Code files for every new build generated, (before the branch is merged into the main branch) and provide an actionable view of the results via GitHub checks.
* Open Pull Requests to Fix build-time issues detected in your branch.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].
