== Get Started with Application Security

The workflow here provides you with step-by-step instructions and best practices to begin with Prisma Cloud Application Security.

* xref:enable-code-security.adoc[Enable] Application Security on Prisma Cloud platform.

* xref:code-security-licensing-configuration.adoc[Manage Licensing Types] in Application Security to get insights into IaC Security, SCA Security and CI/CD Security.

* xref:manage-roles-permissions.adoc[Manage user roles and permissions] for Application Security.

* Connect xref:connect-your-repositories/connect-your-repositories.adoc[Code & Build Providers] that includes Code Repositories, CI/CD runs, CI/CD Systems, and Package Registries. In addition, you can integrate IDE allowing you to detect and fix issues before committing the code.

* Set up xref:iac-tag-and-trace.adoc[IaC Tag and Trace] with xref:drift-detection.adoc[Drift] to get visibility into your buildtime checks.

* *Achieve Comprehensive Visibility* by viewing the organization's security posture after connecting Code & Build Providers. Here are through the following features.

** xref:../visibility/repositories.adoc[Repositories]: A comprehensive view of your engineering technical stack from repository to deployment through a repository-based view.

The repositories displayed are limited to those that you selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, we recommend selecting all repositories during VCS onboarding. In addition, only repositories that the user has been granted access to, as defined by their designated xref:manage-roles-permissions.adoc[role], will be displayed.

* xref:../visibility/technologies/technologies.adoc[Technologies]: An inventory of technologies in use across an organization's software development delivery lifecycle such as GitHub, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS ECR, Docker Hub, as well as third party artifacts, tools and services such as Jenkins plugins used to develop applications in your engineering ecosystem

* xref:../visibility/supply-chain-security.adoc[Supply Chain]: A code-centric view of your infrastructure and application security, visualized through a supply chain graph, which provides real-time auto-discovery of potentially misconfigured infrastructure and application files
