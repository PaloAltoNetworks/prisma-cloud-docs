== Get Started with Application Security

The workflow below provides step-by-step instructions and best practices to help you get up and running with Prisma Cloud’s Application Security module.

* *Integrate* the Application Security on Prisma Cloud console.

** xref:enable-data-security-module.adoc[Enable] the Application Security platform.

** xref:licensing-types.adoc[Manage Licensing Types].

** xref:manage-roles-permissions.adoc[Manage user roles and permissions].

** Integrate your xref:integrate-repositories.adoc[code and build providers] including VCS systems such as GitHub and GitLab, CI/CD runs such as GitHub Actions and Jenkins, CI/CD systems, Package Registries. In addition, integrate your IDE's to allow you to detect and fix issues before committing code.

* *Achieve Comprehensive Visibility* View the organization’s security posture resulting from the integration through the following features.

** xref:repositories.adoc[Repositories]: A comprehensive view of your engineering technical stack from repository to deployment through a repository-based view.

NOTE: The repositories displayed are limited to those that you selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, we recommend selecting all repositories during VCS onboarding. In addition, only repositories that the user has been granted access to, as defined by their designated xref:manage-roles-permissions.adoc[role], will be displayed.

* xref:technologies.adoc[Technologies]: An inventory of technologies in use across an organization’s software development delivery lifecycle such as GitHub, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS ECR, Docker Hub, as well as third party artifacts, tools and services such as Jenkins plugins used to develop applications in your engineering ecosystem

* xref:supply-chain.adoc[Supply Chain]: A code-centric view of your infrastructure and application security, visualized through a supply chain graph, which provides real-time auto-discovery of potentially misconfigured infrastructure and application files

* xref:sbom.adoc[SBOM]: A comprehensive list of all open-source packages, third party services and tools used in the code.   

* xref:code-security-dashboard.adoc[Application Security Dashboard]: A unified view of the top application security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations detected in code across all systems integrated with Prisma Cloud
