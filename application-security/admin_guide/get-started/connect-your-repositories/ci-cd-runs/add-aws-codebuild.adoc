== Add AWS Code Build to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrate Prisma Cloud Application Security with AWS Code Build to scan your Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) files, view incidents on the console, and configure whether or not a build fails based on the severity of the violation.
As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

Use the on-screen sample as a reference to configure the buildspec file for AWS CodeBuild.
A buildspec is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. Save this file in the root (top level) directory.

You can see the AWS CodeBuild repositories configured with the buildspec file on *Settings > Repositories* on *Code Repositories*. On your next AWS CodeBuild scan, the scan results will include the newly configured repositories. You can view the scan results on *Application Security > Projects* on *Overview*.
