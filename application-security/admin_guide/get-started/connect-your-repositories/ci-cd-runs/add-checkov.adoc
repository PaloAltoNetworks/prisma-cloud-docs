== Add Checkov to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with Checkov makes it possible for Prisma Cloud Application Security to scan your infrastructure as code files like Terraform and CloudFormation, display errors on the console while causing the build to fail in case of any identified misconfigurations.
To know more see https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Visualizing%20Checkov%20Output.html[Checkov].
As a prerequisite, ensure Prisma Cloud IP addresses are on the allow list for Application Security. For more details see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hosts].


[.procedure]

. Install Checkov using CLI that Prima Cloud console provides.

.. Select *Settings > Repositories > Add repository* and then select *Checkov*.

.. Select a program to install Checkov and then copy the command to your Command Line to run a Checkov installation.
+
You can choose between Python (pip), Python3 (pip3) and Homebrew (if you are on Mac OS). For additional alternatives to install Checkov, see https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Installing%20Checkov.html[here].

NOTE: Checkov requires Python version 3.8 - 3.10.

.. Select *Next*.

. Configure directory and repository for scan.

.. Add *Directory* and *Repository ID* to scan and then select *Next*.
+
Optionally, you can choose to add a specific *Branch* of a repository that hosts the directory. If a branch is not specified, then Application Security scans the master branch of the repository.

Your configured Checkov repositories will appear on the *Repositories* in *CI/CD Systems* view.

On your next Checkov scan, view the scan results on *Application Security > Projects* in *CI/CD Runs* view.


=== General Patterns for Using Checkov

When using Checkov in a pipeline or locally, here are some useful commands to get started.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===

|Command
|Description

| `-d <directory>` or `-f <filepath>`
| Specifies the directory or files to be scanned.

|`--prisma-api-url <Prisma Stack API URL>` or `PRISMA_API_URL=<Prisma Stack API URL>`
| An environment variable to indicate the API URL for your stack. See https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/api-urls/[here] for the URL or in the Checkov wizard.

| `--bc-api-key <PRISMA_ACCESS_KEY::PRISMA_SECRET_KEY>` or `BC_API_KEY=<PRISMA_ACCESS_KEY::PRISMA_SECRET_KEY>`
| An environment variable for your xref:../../generate-access-keys.adoc[Prisma Cloud credentials].

|===

For more Checkov CLI commands, see https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html[CLI reference].

In this example you see the Checkov configuration to scan the root directory, synchronize results with the tenant in the App2 stack, repository ID org/repo `--repo-id org/repo` using xref:../../../risk-prevention/code/enforcement.adoc[Enforcement] to set the thresholds.

[source.shell]
----
export PRISMA_API_URL=https://api2.prismacloud.io
export BC_API_KEY=prismaaccesskey::prismasecretkey
checkov -d . --repo-id org/repo --use-enforcement-rules
----

For Windows, use:

[source.shell]
----
set PRISMA_API_URL=https://api2.prismacloud.io
set BC_API_KEY=prismaaccesskey::prismasecretkey
checkov -d . --repo-id org/repo --use-enforcement-rules
----
