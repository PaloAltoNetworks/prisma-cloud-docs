== Add GitLab to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab makes it possible for Code Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files (Terraform and CloudFormation) and monitor configuration issues in development.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].
