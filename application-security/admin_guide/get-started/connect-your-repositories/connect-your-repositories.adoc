== Connect Code & Build Providers

The Application Security capabilities support a wide range of Cloud DevSecOps systems, integrated development environments (IDEs), and CI/CD pipeline systems.

Before you begin adding your development environments and pipelines for scanning, you must first xref:../generate-access-keys.adoc[generate access keys] to allow permissions for specific users. You also need to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

Integrations include:

* xref:ci-cd-runs/ci-cd-runs.adoc[CI/CD Runs]
* xref:ci-cd-systems/ci-cd-systems.adoc[CI/CD Systems]
* xref:package-registries/package-registries.adoc[Private Registries]

=== Add Code & Build Providers

To add the environments that host your templates and source code, begin at *Settings > Code & Build Providers*.

The *Code & Build Providers* provides a catalog of the different environments that you can integrate to can scan and monitor for security and compliance violations through Prisma Cloud.

After you have added an environment you can access the repositories in the environment, view their details, sort the list, perform searches search and delete repositories.

The catalog displays a list of supported Version Control Systems (VCS), CI/CD Runs, CI/CD Systems, Package Registries and IDEs.
+
Once the repositories are integrated, you can view the list on *Code Repositories*, *CI/CD systems* or *Private Registries* based on the type of integrations.
+
The table below provides links to instructions for integrating different environments with Prisma Cloud, along with details of the CAS modules supported for each integration.
