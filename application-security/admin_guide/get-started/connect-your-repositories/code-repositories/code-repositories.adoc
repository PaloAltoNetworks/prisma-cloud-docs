== Code Repositories

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Code Repositories in order to scan for misconfigurations in your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files, vulnerabilities in your software composition analysis (SCA) packages, to detect secrets exposed in your code and license violations.

Code Repositories integrations include:

* xref:add-azurerepos.adoc[ Add Azure Repos]
* xref:add-bitbucket.adoc[Add Bitbucket]
* xref:add-bitbucket-server.adoc[Add Bitbucket Server]
* xref:add-github.adoc[Add GitHub]
* xref:add-github-server.adoc[Add GitHub Server]
* xref:add-gitlab.adoc[Add GitLab]
* xref:add-gitlab-selfmanaged.adoc[Add Gitlab Self-managed]

=== Verify Integration

After integrating your version control system, you can verify if a repository is successfully connected to Prisma Cloud by checking if its status is *Connected* on the *Code & Build Providers* page. If it is not connected, an error message will be displayed.
