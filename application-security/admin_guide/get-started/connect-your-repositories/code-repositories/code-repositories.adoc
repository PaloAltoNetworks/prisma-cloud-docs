== Code Repositories

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your code repositories in order to scan for misconfigurations in your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files, vulnerabilities in your software composition analysis (SCA) packages, secrets exposed in your code, license mis-compliance, and CI/CD pipeline risks.
