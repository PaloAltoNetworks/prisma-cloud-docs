== Add GitHub to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrating GitHub allows Prisma Cloud to:

* Include your Infrastructure-as-Code files in daily scans.
* Scan changed resources in Infrastructure-as-Code files for every new build generated, (before the branch is merged into the main branch) and provide an actionable view of the results via GitHub checks.
* Open Pull Requests to Fix build-time issues detected in your branch.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

*Best Practice*: The Prisma User responsible for integrating GitHub should also possess GitHub User credentials with Admin permissions on the relevant GitHub Organization.

Your configured GitHub repositories will appear on the *Repositories* page. On your next GitHub scan, the scan results will include the new configured repositories. Access *Application Security > Projects* to view the scanned results. See xref:../../../risk-prevention/code/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan.adoc[Suppress or Fix] to resolve remediation.
