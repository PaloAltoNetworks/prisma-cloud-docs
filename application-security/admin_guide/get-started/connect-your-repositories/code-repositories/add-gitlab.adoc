== Add GitLab to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab makes it possible for Application Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files (Terraform and CloudFormation) and monitor configuration issues in development.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

It is recommended to perform the integration when logged on to GitLab with Admin user permissions.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
//* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured GitLab account.

.. Select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Add* > *GitLab* (under *Code Repositories*).

.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
