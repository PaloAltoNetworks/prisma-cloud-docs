== Add GitLab to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab makes it possible for Application Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files (Terraform and CloudFormation) and monitor configuration issues in development.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

It is recommended to perform the integration when logged on to GitLab with Admin user permissions.

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for multiple integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or a same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
//* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

+
NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured GitLab account.

.. Select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Add* > *GitLab* (under *Code Repositories*).

.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
+

.. Execute *steps 3 - 6* of the GitLab installation process above.
+
The new integration is displayed on the landing page of the wizard. You can view your integrated GitLab repositories under *Code Repositories* on the *Code & Build Providers* page. The next scan of your GitLab systems will include include the new integrations with their configured repositories, and the results will be displayed in xref:../../../risk-prevention/code/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan.adoc[Monitor and Fix Issues in Your Scans].

// verify if Code Security has not been changed

=== Manage Integrations

Manage integrations from the integration wizard.

. Access the GitLab Self-Managed integration wizard -  see *step 1* of <<multi-integrate,Support for multiple integrations>> above > select the menu under *Actions*.

From Actions you can:
