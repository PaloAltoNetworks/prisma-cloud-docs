== Add GitLab Self-Managed to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab Self-Managed makes it possible for Cloud Application Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files (Terraform and CloudFormation) and monitor configuration issues in development.

To ensure network reachability between your GitLab environment and Prisma Cloud Application Security, as a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

The hostname or IP address you provide must also be resolvable on the public DNS.

It is recommended to perform the integration when logged on to GitLab Self-managed with Admin user permissions.

[.procedure]

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for multiple integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab Self-Managed. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or a same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
//* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces
* Add additional integrations.
* Delete an existing integration

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured GitLab Self-Managed account.

.. Select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Add* > *GitLab Self-Managed* (under *Code Repositories*).

.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
+
The *Configure Domain* step of the installation wizard is displayed.
//image::gl-sm-add-integration.png[width=800]

.. Configure your Domain as stated in step *1* of the GitLab Self-Managed installation process above and then proceed to execute steps *2-5* of the installation procedure.
+
The new integration is displayed on the landing page of the wizard. You can view your configured GitLab Self-managed repositories under *Code Repositories* on the *Code & Build Providers* page. The next scan of your GitLab Self-Managed systems will include the new integrations with their configured repositories, and the results will be displayed in xref:../risk-prevention/code/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan.adoc[Monitor and Fix Issues in Your Scans].

// verify if Code Security has not been changed
