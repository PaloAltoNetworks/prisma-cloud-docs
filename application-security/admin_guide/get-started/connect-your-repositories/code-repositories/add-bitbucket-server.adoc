== Add Bitbucket Server to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrating Bitbucket Server with Prisma Cloud enhances your security posture by enabling Prisma Cloud Application Security to comprehensively analyze your infrastructure-as-code and open source packages. This integration empowers you to uncover potential vulnerabilities, identify exposed secrets within your repositories, and facilitate effective mitigation strategies. A key feature of this synergy is the establishment of a webhook mechanism that performs periodic scans on your repositories, generating push events for pull request analysis. It further generates detailed reports and inline comments, streamlining the process of addressing identified issues. The integration also enables you to initiate fix pull requests directly from Prisma Cloud console, ensuring seamless remediation.

As a prerequisite for ensuring seamless communication between your Bitbucket Server environment and Prisma Cloud Application Security, it is essential to add Prisma Cloud IP addresses and the hostname associated with Application Security to an allow list. This ensures uninterrupted access to the Prisma Cloud Console. To know more see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console]. Additionally, the provided hostname or IP address must be resolvable on public DNS servers.

NOTE: The integration with Bitbucket Server extends support to Bitbucket Data Center and Server versions 6.7 and above.

. Configure appropriate permissions.

.. Add *Permissions*.
+
By default, the access token's permissions align with your current access level. It is crucial to establish two tiers of permissions - *Project Permissions* and *Repository Permissions*. The Repository Permissions inherits the Project Permissions, necessitating the Repository Permissions match or exceed Project Permissions. For example, if you possess Project write permission, a corresponding Repository write permission should be granted. Token permissions are modifiable and revocable as needed.
To knoe more on Project and Repository permissions, see https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0717/personal-access-tokens-1087535496.html[here].
+
*Required Permissions:*

* *For Projects - Read*
* *For Repositories - Admin*
+
Granting read and write permissions to relevant repositories empowers Prisma Cloud to copy files for scanning purposes and access repository settings. This facilitates subscription to pull request (PR) webhooks, enabling the initiation of fix PRs and comments on open PRs.

.. Add *Expiry*.
+
For additional security set the token to automatically expire. The expiry date of a token cannot be changed after it is created. You can see the expiry dates for all your tokens on *Profile picture > Manage account > Personal access tokens*.

. Verify Bitbucket Server integration with Prisma Cloud.

.. Access the Prisma Cloud console and then select *Done*.
+
image::bitb-server-9.png[width=600]
+
In your Bitbucket Server, a new webhook for Prisma Cloud will be created.
+
You can view the integrated Bitbucket Server repositories in Prisma Cloud on *Settings > Repositories*.
+
The scan results include the new integrated repositories on your next Bitbucket Server scan. Access *Application Security* to view the scanned results. See xref:../../../risk-prevention/code/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan.adoc[Suppress or Fix] for remediation of the issues.
