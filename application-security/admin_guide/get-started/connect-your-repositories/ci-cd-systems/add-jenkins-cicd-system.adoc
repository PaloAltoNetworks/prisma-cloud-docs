== Add Jenkins CI/CD Systems to Prisma Cloud Application Security

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Jenkins server to gain visibility into and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the Jenkins platform.
Integrating Jenkins will allow you to conduct security scans to identify issues such as CI/CD pipeline risks, vulnerabilities, and exposed secrets in the Jenkins environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected.

[.procedure]

. In Prisma Cloud Generate and save a Prisma Cloud Access Key ID and secret if you have not yet performed this task.
+
It is recommended to assign the access token the role of *System Admin* to facilitate integration.

. On the Prisma Cloud console.

.. Select *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Add* > *Jenkins Plugin* (under CI/CD Systems).

.. Provide a *Jenkins Instance Display Name* > *Next*.
+
A unique *Jenkins instance identifier* is automatically generated after providing the Jenkins instance display name.
+
The display name is an alias of your choice, allowing you to identify the integration.

+
NOTE: You can retrieve your Jenkins instance identifier by accessing the integrated Jenkins Plugin (see step 1 above) >  selecting the *Actions* menu next to an integration in the wizard > *Copy instance identifier*.

. In Jenkins.

.. If your Jenkins server has limited outgoing connections, make sure to permit an outgoing connection from the Jenkins server to Prisma IP addresses. For Prisma Cloud IP addresses see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[here].

.. Install the plugin on your Jenkins server.
+
* Open Jenkins and select: *Manage Jenkins* > *Plugins* (under _System Configuration_) > *Advanced settings*.
