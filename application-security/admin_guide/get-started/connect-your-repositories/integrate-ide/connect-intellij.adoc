== Connect IntelliJ with Prisma Cloud Application security

Integrating IntelliJ with Prisma Cloud Application security makes it possible for you to identify misconfigurations before you commit your code, and avoid pull requests that can potentially fail builds due to undetected misconfigurations. Using Checkov, a code analysis tool that scans Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files from frameworks such as Terraform, Terraform_plan, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Secrets, Serverless, Dockerfile (only code), and Kubernetes on IntelliJ gives you immediate detection of misconfigurations and inline code fixes.
Apart from the scanning the default Prisma Cloud policies, Checkov also scans for policy violations in custom policies that you can configure during custom build-time checks.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

[.procedure]

. Verify the pre-requisites.
+
For IntelliJ, get the details for enabling authentication to Prisma Cloud.
+
* *Access Key.*
+
The access key enables access to Prisma Cloud. If you do not have the access key, refer to xref:../../generate-access-keys.adoc[Generate Access Key].
+
* *Secret Key.*
+
The secret key generates with your access key. Save your secret key when you generate it, as you cannot view it again on Prima Cloud.
+
* *Python Installation.*
+
Checkov needs Python to run, install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python version 3.7] or above. If you have a versatile working environment of both pip and virtual environment install https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv] or https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker].
+
* *Prisma Cloud API URL.*
+
When you configure Checkov plugin to IntelliJ you need Prisma Cloud API URL. The URL for Prisma Cloud varies depending on the region and cluster on which your tenant is deployed. The tenant provisioned for you is, for example, https://app2.prismacloud.io or https://app.eu.prismacloud.io. For Prisma Cloud API URL, replace *app* in the URL with *api*.

.. Add your Prisma Cloud application API for *Prisma URL (Required if using Prisma Cloud Access Token)* for example *https://api.prismacloud.io*.
+

+
You can optionally choose to add a custom CA-Certificate and enter the certificate path to configure for *CA-Certificate*. Ensure your CA-Certificate is in ".pem" format.

.. Select *OK*.
+
A Checkov scan runs each time you open a file on IntelliJ.

. Fix scanned files for policy misconfiguration in build-time checks.

.. Select *File > Policy misconfiguration* and then select *Fix* for Checkov to fix the misconfiguration.
+
Each misconfiguration has details on the policy violation and guidelines to fix the policy. See https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/aws-policy-index[here] to know more about each of misconfigurations in all supported environments. For custom policy and out-of-the-box misconfigurations you can access the Prisma Cloud Administrator console to know more.

=== Troubleshoot Logs

In case of a Checkov scan fail, you can access Checkov logs to see more details.

* Access IntelliJ and then select *Show Log in Explorer* for Windows or *Help > Show Log in Finder* for Mac.

* Access *idea.log* to see the log details.
