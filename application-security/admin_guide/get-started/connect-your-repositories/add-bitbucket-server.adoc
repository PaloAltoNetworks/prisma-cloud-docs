== Add Bitbucket Server to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with Bitbucket Server makes it possible for Prisma Cloud Code Security to scan your infrastructure-as-code and open source packages, as well as detect secrets in your repositories. This integration creates a webhook that periodically scans your repositories, creates a push event to scan pull requests and creates reports and inline comments, and enables you to open fix pull requests from Prisma Cloud.

To ensure network reachability between your Bitbucket Server environment and Prisma Cloud Code Security as a prerequisite you must add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

The hostname or IP address you provide must also be resolvable on the public DNS.

NOTE: The Bitbucket Server integration on Prisma Cloud supports Bitbucket Data Center and Server version 6.7 and above.

.. Add *Permissions*.
+
By default, the access token's permissions are set similar to your current level of access. You need to define two levels of permissions - *Project permissions* and *Repository permission*. Repository permission inherits the Project permissions; thus, Repository permission should be as high as the Project permission. For example, if you have a Project write permission, you should also have a Repository write permission. You can always modify or revoke token permissions. If you need to know more about the Project and Repository permissions, see https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0717/personal-access-tokens-1087535496.html[here].
+
*Required Permissions:*

* *For Projects - Read* 
* *For Repositories - Admin*
+
Granting read and write permissions to the relevant repositories allows Prisma Cloud to copy files for scanning and to have access to repository settings in order to subscribe to the pull request (PR) webhooks to open fix PRs and comment on opened PRs.
+

.. Add *Expiry*.
+
For additional security set the token to automatically expire. The expiry date of a token cannot be changed after it is created. You can see the expiry dates for all your tokens on *Profile picture > Manage account > Personal access tokens*.
