== Manage Network Tunnels (Transporter)

The Transporter is a network tunnel that allows you to establish a secure communication channel between Prisma Cloud and your self-hosted version control systems (VCS) that do not allow inbound network traffic. For Transporter to establish a communication channel between your environment and Prisma Cloud, two components are required:

* *Prisma Cloud Transporter Client*: A Docker container running in your environment with access to VCS isolated from inbound network traffic 
* *Prisma Cloud Transporter Server*: Access to the server will be pre-enabled

To configure the Transporter, you need to define the domain configuration by specifying a proxy URL along with a port number. This setup ensures that the Transporter can securely communicate with Prisma Cloud via an HTTPS connection. Establishing a secure HTTPS connection between the Transporter and your self-hosted VCS requires a SSL certificate and key. After the configuration is complete, Prisma Cloud provides commands to pull and run the Transporter in your environment using Docker or Helm Charts.

The following image describes Transporter connectivity with your environment.

After configuring Transporter in your environment, Prisma Cloud authenticates the connection between the Transporter and Prisma Cloud and then establishes a communication channel through the WebSocket. You can then define which VCS integration on Prisma Cloud will use the Transporter.

Prisma Cloud currently supports Transporter integrations on GitLab Self-managed, GitHub Enterprise Server and Bitbucket Server. A single Transporter on the Prisma Cloud can secure multiple VCS integrations or you can use multiple Transporters.

NOTE: Transporter is only available on request.
