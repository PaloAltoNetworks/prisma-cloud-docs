:topic_type: task

[.task]
== Task Template

Task-type topics have a clear structure supported by markup.
Start each task-type topic with the `:topic_type: task` markup.

Depending on the use case, a single topic can collect multiple task sections or even have nested sections.
To start a task section in a topic, you must specify that the heading belongs to a task.
Use the `[.task]` markup before a heading to specify the section is a task.
Headings must include equal signs to the left.
Use equal signs to set the level of the heading following this formula.

    Level = Number of equal signs - 1

Every task section must include a procedure section.
Procedures are ordered lists of steps. 
Only include the steps required to complete the task.

To mark an ordered list as a procedure, place the `[.procedure]` markup before the first item on the list.
Use a plus sign `+` in the line between the list item and its description, command, YAML, or screenshot without breaking the list.
For example, the following procedure shows multiple steps.

[.procedure]
. First step needed to complete the task.
+
[source,yaml]
```
This step includes YAML key-value pairs, and uses the [source,yaml] label for the code block.
```

. Second step needed to complete the task.
+
[source,bash]
```
This step includes a command, and uses the [source,bash] label for the code block.
```

. Third step needed to complete the task as shown on a screenshot.
