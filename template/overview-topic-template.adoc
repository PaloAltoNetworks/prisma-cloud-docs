== Overview Topic Template

Every topic must have a title with two equal signs `==` to the right.
The filename of the topic must include all main words of the title separated by dashes `-`. 
For example, this template has the `overview-topic-template.adoc` filename.

Overview topics only include the following information.

* Why is the content under this overview revelant to customers?
* How are the sections under this overview related?
* Why is the content in the sections under the overview topic's umbrella?
* Include a list of links to all sections under the overview with a single sentence description of the content in each page.

Overview topics do not have subsections.
