== Fine Tune Your Configuration Settings

Once your code repositories are integrated, you can modify your configuration to specify how Prisma Cloud scans your code. This includes:

* <<exclude-paths-from-code-security-scans>>
* <<enable-notifications>>

[#exclude-paths-from-code-security-scans]
=== Exclude Paths from Code Security scans

Configure your code security scan by adding rules to an integrated repository.
New rules are scanned only for a single defined repository.
However, you can configure multiple repositories to a defined rule.

By default, Prisma Cloud scans all paths in all repositories.
You can add a rule to specify which repository paths to exclude when scanning.
Before you begin adding rules, disable the default configuration for all repositories.

[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Code Configuration* to configure your integrated repository.

. Enter paths to exclude from the repository.

.. Type paths to exclude within the selected repository.
+
Use comma (,) to list more than one file or path.
+
In this example, On Enter Paths, type `test, _test, \/test\/` this will exclude any path or file with the specified context.

[#enable-notifications]
=== Enable Notifications

Enable Prisma Cloud to send notifications for Code Security scan results to an external integration. Prisma Cloud Code Security supports notifications to Microsoft Teams, Slack, Splunk, JIRA, ServiceNow and Webhooks only.

By default, Notifications are disabled. See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud.html[Configure External Integrations on Prisma Cloud] to set up an integration.
After you have set it up, you must first enable notifications, modify the default rule that  scans all paths in all repositories and add new rules for your notification preferences.

[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Code Security Configuration* and enable *Notifications*.

. Set up your notification preferences.

.. Enable repositories you want to scan.
+
image::_notifications.png[width=600]

.. Select the Name or ID of the integration.
+

.. Select the policy severity threshold.
+
You can choose for severity higher than High, Medium or Low.
+
image::_3_notifications.png[width=600]
