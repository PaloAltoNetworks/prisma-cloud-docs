== Create Custom Policies for Build-Time Checks

Prisma Cloud includes out-of-the-box policies that enable you to detect misconfigurations and provide automated fixes for security issues seen across your integrated code repositories and pipelines. On *Policies* you can review the list of configuration policies including custom policies using the subtype filter of *Build*.

You can create custom build policies for the following formats:

* *Terraform* - Policies written using Terraform attributes will apply for Terraform (.tf and plan files).
* *CloudFormation* - Policies written using CloudFormation attributes will apply for CloudFormation, AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), and Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

In addition, Prisma Cloud also supports identification of custom secrets that you can define using regular expression patterns.
While defining the regular expression patterns consider the following parameters:

* You must ensure the `RegEx` pattern meets standard regular expression formatting standards.
* Criteria to consider when defining `RegEx` pattern.
** Length of the pattern must be defined and between 5-100 characters.
** Ensure there are no `backreferences`, `backtracking`, and no unbounded wildcards like `/.*/ or /.+/`.
* You can define up to 5 `RegEx` patterns per policy.

=== Add a New Custom Policy for Build-Time Checks


If you have custom requirements or want to define guardrails for your specific security or compliance needs, you have the flexibility to add new custom policies for your already existing repositories. As soon as you xref:../../get-started/connect-your-repositories/connect-your-repositories.adoc[Connect Your Repositories to Code Security] both the out-of-the-box policies and custom policies are used to scan for potential issues.

[.procedure]

. Create a custom configuration policy for build-time checks.

.. Select *Policies > Add Policy > Config*.
+

.. Add *Policy Name*.
+
image::custom-build-1.png[width=600]
+
Optionally, you can add a *Description*. The description can include an overview of the error, prevention information and fix information in case of a policy error.
+
image::custom-build-2.png[width=600]

.. Select *Build*.
+
image::custom-build-3.png[width=600]
+
You can choose to only select *Build* or continue with the both *Run* and *Build* subtypes. However, the following steps are only for Build subtype.
+
To create a customize Run policies see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-policies/create-a-policy[Create a Custom Policy on Prisma Cloud]

.. Select *Severity* for the policy.
+
image::custom-build-4.png[width=600]
+
Prisma Cloud supports five levels of policy severity-  *Critical, High, Medium, Low and Informational*.
+
A policy severity helps define the impact of policy configuration on your environment, while helping you filter the misconfigurations after a scan on *Code Security > Projects*.
+
Optionally, you can add *Labels* to the policy.
+
image::custom-build-5.png[width=600]
+
In this example, you see a custom build policy for S3 Bucket ACL where log delivery is not recommended with the relevant policy details.
+

.. Select *Next*.

. Create a rule for custom configuration policy.
+
In a custom configuration policy rule, you can define criteria to check the configuration for both run-time and build-time, that is for Run and Build policy subtypes; in the following steps you will create a policy rule for only build rule.
To create a custom build policy rule you can choose between Code Editor and Visual Editor.
+
* xref:../custom-build-policies/code-editor.adoc[Code Editor]
+
Code Editor is the default view for Build policy rule and as an example YAML policy template is always available with guidelines on the console. You can choose this editor to create a custom policy rule using YAML policy templates.
+
* xref:../custom-build-policies/visual-editor.adoc[Visual Editor]
+
You can choose this editor to create a quick custom policy rule that supports creation of attribute checks without a Connection State and a support of AND/OR logic. You will use the existing fields on the console that are mostly auto-populated based on your selection.


. Add Compliance Standards for the Build policy.

.. Select *Standard, Requirement* and *Sections*.
+
* *Standard* is the default compliance standard that is listed on the Prisma Cloud console.
* *Requirement* is influenced by the selection of the compliance standard.
* *Section* of may or may not be influenced by the compliance standard.
+

.. Select *Next*.

. Remediation for Build policy.
+
image::custom-build-9.png[width=600]
+
Currently remediation recommendation for custom build policies is not available.

. Submit your custom policy.
+
image::custom-build-10.png[width=600]
+
After you save the custom build policy, on the next scan, the onboarded resources are scanned against the new policy. The scan results display on the *Code Security > Projects* where you can identify the resources that failed the check and triggered a policy violation.
+
For custom secrets, policies are automatically disabled if the findings are above 150 per repository. On *Code Security > Projects* you can access the policy to edit.
