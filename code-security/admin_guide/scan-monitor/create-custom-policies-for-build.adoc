== Create Custom Policies for Build-Time Checks

Prisma Cloud includes out-of-the-box policies that enable you to detect misconfigurations and provide automated fixes for security issues that are detected across your integrated code repositories and pipelines.
You can review this list of Configuration policies with a filter for subtype *Build* on the Prisma Cloud administrative console *Policies* page.

=== Add a New Custom Policy for Build-Time Checks

If you have custom requirements or want to define guardrails for your specific security or compliance needs, you have the flexibility to add new custom policies for your already existing repositories. As soon as you xref:../get-started/connect-your-repositories/connect-your-repositories.adoc[Connect Your Repositories to Code Security], both the out-of-the-box policies and custom  policies are used to scan for potential issues.

[.procedure]

. Add a new custom policy for subtype Build.

.. Select  *Policies> Add Policy> Config*.
+

.. Enter a *Policy Name*.
+
You can optionally add a *Description* to your new custom policy.

.. Select *Policy Subtype - Build*.
+
This subtype enables you to scan IaC templates such as â€”Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes that are used to deploy cloud resources.

.. Select *Severity* and click *Next*.
+
You can optionally add *Labels* for your new custom policy.
+
In this example, you create a custom build policy for S3 Bucket ACL where a log delivery is not recommended.

. Create a rule.
+
For a custom configuration policy rule, you can define criteria to check the configuration for both *Run* and *Build* policy subtypes, that is run-time and build-time checks.
In this example, you create only a custom build policy rule.
+
When creating a build rule for your policy, you must specify what the policy is checking for and against which resource. To do this, you specify the *Category Type*, *Cloud* *Provider*, *Resource Type*, and *Query*. After the scan, any resource that does not match the criteria you define, fails the policy check. You can view the policy violation in the *Code Security* page.
+

.. Select *Category Type*, *Cloud Provider* and *Resource Type*.
+
Category type is where the policy is grouped as either Elasticsearch, General, IAM, Kubernetes, Logging, Monitoring, Networking, Public, Secrets, Serverless, Storage and Vulnerabilities Net. You can use the category type to search or filter specific policies.
+
Cloud Provider is where you can create build rules only for Cloud Service Providers that are supported on Prisma Cloud.
+
Each custom build policy must be associated with a cloud provider and resource type.

.. Select *Attribute*, *Operator* and *Value* to add a *Query* to your new custom build policy.
+
The query defines the match condition to verify whether a resource does not have the specified value, or if the specified value exists.
+
Attribute is where you can define values for a configuration that describes a resource. The attribute value also defines the presence or absence of an attribute in the query.
+
You can use And/OR logic to create a rule with more than one query. The And/Or logic helps you create multiple blocks within the policy where attributes can be defined and associated with resources.
+
Using the And/Or logic you can define the association between multiple blocks in a specific YAML policy definition. You can use the And logic when you want to indicate a connection between two types of resources, in only a subset of the defined resource. You can use both And/Or logic to indicate a collection of value pairs in a query.

.. Test Query to preview a list of existing resources that are not compliant with the build query you defined.
+
You can view the number of matching results and the code preview.
+
In this example, the test results for the S3 Bucket ACL query.
+

. Add Compliance Standards.
+
image::_5_create_custompolicies.png[width=800]

.. Select *Standard*, *Requirement* and *Section* and select *Next*.
+
You can add multiple compliance standards for a custom policy.

. Add remediation to the policy.
+
image::_6_custompolicies.png[width=800]

. Submit your custom policy.
+

+
Your resources are scanned with your new custom build policy on the next scan. You can identify the resources that failed the check and triggered a policy violation on *Code Security* page.
