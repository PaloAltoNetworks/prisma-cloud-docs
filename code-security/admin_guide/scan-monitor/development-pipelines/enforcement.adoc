== Enforcement

Enforcement enables you to configure code review scan parameters in your repositories and customize violation failures and comments. On the Prisma Cloud console there are default parameters, based on best practices, for each code category scanned  in your repositories. Using enforcement  you can configure these default parameters and receive violation notifications only for critical issues, helping you reduce unnecessary noise and optimizing secure productivity.

Enforcement configurations scan every commit into your repository and suggest fix remedies, if any violation is detected, this is in addition to the scan that Prisma Cloud periodically performs on your repositories, the results for which are accessible on Projects.
The periodic scans have a predefined severity threshold which are run across code categories that result in three run rules.

* *Hard Fail*
+
A repository scan result fails when Prisma Cloud detects a violation or a vulnerability.

* *Soft Fail*
+
A repository scan result is a pass and a notification appears on the console when Prisma Cloud detects a violation or a vulnerability.

* *Comment bot*
+
A repository scan result  displays issues with fix suggestions as comments with Pull requests accessible on VCS (Version Control System).

Prisma Cloud scans multiple code categories to identify vulnerabilities and violations unique to the category. See the table for more details.


[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Code Category | Description

|Vulnerabilities
|Where your repositories packages and binaries in a selected container image are scanned for SCA vulnerabilities and license issues by Prisma Cloud.

|Licenses
|Where  Prisma Cloud scans any SCA vulnerabilities and license issues found on open source dependencies.

|IaC
|Where you provision and manage your infrastructure through code. Prisma Cloud scans Infrastructure as code files for misconfiguration issues.

|Build Integrity
|Where Prisma Cloud scans your CI/CD pipelines and VCS that are integrated on the console for misconfiguration issues found in branch or pipeline configuration files.

|Secrets
|A Secret is a programmatic access key that provides systems with access to information, services or assets. Prisma Cloud scans secret leaks issues across code files.

You can manage Enforcement configuration scan results by modifying the default configurations, adding an exception configuration, turning run rule off for a code category configurations, and reviewing either fail scans or suggestions to a vulnerability on your VCS (Version Control System).

NOTE: See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions[Prisma Cloud Administrator Permissions] and know more about user roles and permissions to configure enforcement.

* <<modify-default-enforcement, Modify the default parameters.>>
+
You can modify the default parameters for each code category and set up a new default parameter. However, each time a default configuration is modified, the parameters are applicable across all repositories on the Prisma Cloud console.
+
NOTE: Soft Fail configuration for any code category must be lower than Hard Fail.

* <<add-an-exception-to-enforcement, Add an exception.>>
+
You can  add an exception configuration for each code category that is applicable only for select repositories that you have access to. The exception configuration runs in addition to the default enforcement configurations.

* <<turn-off-run-rule-scan-for-a-code-category, Turn off run rule scan for a code category.>>
+
You can choose to prevent an enforcement configuration from running a scan for one or more run rules for a code category. The parameter to turn off a scan for a code category can be an addition to either a default configuration or to an exception configuration. Turning the scan off for a run rule in a code category results in no code review scan.

* <<review-fail-scans-and-suggestions-on-vcs, Review fail scans and suggestions on VCS (Version Control System).>>
+
For every failed scan result you can view the latest Pull Request (PR) of your repository within the Prisma Cloud console. Currently the ability to review violation fix suggestions and view the Pull Request (PR) scans that failed is supported only for Github repositories. From the Prisma Cloud console you can directly access your repositories in Github and remediate solutions through a Pull Request (PR).
