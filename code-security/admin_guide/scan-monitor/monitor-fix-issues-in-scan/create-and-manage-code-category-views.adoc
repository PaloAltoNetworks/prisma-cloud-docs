== Create and Manage Code Category views

Prima Cloud provides you with eight default views across Overview, IaC misconfiguration, Vulnerabilities, Secrets, Licenses, Build Integrity, VCS Pull Requests and CI/CD Runs. Using the views allows you to focus on relevant use cases and prioritizing on mitigating errors.
