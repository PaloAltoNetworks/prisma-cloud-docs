== Fix Issues in a Scan Result

On *Projects*, you can remediate scan results across all code categories by adding issues to the fix cart to create a PR with a suggested fix. For every issue found on Prisma Cloud console, you can view information like origin of the issue in a file or repository, policy violation, and suggestions to remediate the issue.

[.procedure]

. Access scan results on *Projects*.

.. Select a code category with an issue.

.. Select an issue from the resource block to view more information and suggested fixes in the resource explorer.

In this example, on IaC Misconfiguration you see `aws_s3_bucket.public_read` resource block with an issue that has a fix.

To resolve an issue, you need to access the PR on the VCS console and merge the fix with the default branch.
+
If the issue does not have a fix suggestion, you can choose a *Manual Fix* or *Suppress*.

=== Manual Fix an issue

You can perform a manual fix for all issues. A manual fix enables you to access a specific commit to review the code to then resolve the issue manually using the policy guidelines on the Prisma Cloud console.
