== Fix Issues in a Scan Result

On *Projects*, you can remediate scan results across all code categories by adding issues to the fix cart to create a PR with a suggested fix. For every issue found on Prisma Cloud console, you can view information like origin of the issue in a file or repository, policy violation, and suggestions to remediate the issue.

[.procedure]

. Access scan results on *Projects*.

.. Select a code category with an issue.

.. Select an issue from the resource block to view more information and suggested fixes in the resource explorer.
+
In this example, on IaC Misconfiguration you see `aws_s3_bucket.public_read` resource block with an issue that has a fix.

To resolve an issue, you need to access the PR on the VCS console and merge the fix with the default branch.

If the issue does not have a fix suggestion, you can choose a *Manual Fix* or *Suppress*.

=== Manual Fix an issue

You can perform a manual fix for all issues. A manual fix enables you to access a specific commit to review the code to then resolve the issue manually using the policy guidelines on the Prisma Cloud console.
