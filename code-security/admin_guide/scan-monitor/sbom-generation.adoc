== Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a list of the components such as open source packages or IaC resources,  that make up a software or an application. The list also details the known vulnerabilities of these components and other metadata such as the license details for each package.

On Prisma Cloud you can export open source packages found in package manager files or container images, as well as IaC resources and findings to generate an SBOM report. An SBOM report can either be an artifact from a CI/CD pipeline or from the Prisma Cloud platform for onboarded repositories.

=== Generate an SBOM on the Prisma Cloud Console

You can access the SBOM Generation wizard from either the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/supply-chain-security[Supply Chain] page or the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/development-pipelines[Development Pipelines] page.

. Select the repository you would like to include in the report.

. Select the output format (CSV or CycloneDX).

. Select which resources to include in the SBOM:

* *Open-source packages* - findings from scans of open source dependencies
* *Infrastructure as Code* - findings from IaC scans
* *Images* - packages found in images built or referenced in the repository

Selecting *All* will either generate three separate files for each resource type if you use CSV format, or a merged file for all resource types if you use CycloneDX.

=== Generating an SBOM from a CI/CD Pipeline

You can generate an SBOM from your CI/CD pipeline by adding `-o cyclonedx` or `-o csv` to the end of your CLI command (for a selected directory or file). For example, the command `checkov -d . --bc-api-key PRISMA_ACCESS_KEY::PRISMA_SECRET_KEY -o cyclonedx` will scan a directory and output the findings in CycloneDX XML format.

=== Supported SBOM Formats

Prisma Cloud currently supports the export of SBOM reports in two standardized formats: CSV and CyclondeDX.

* CSV is a comma-separated format that displays a line per vulnerability or misconfiguration and a line per resource or package without issues, sorted by groups of open source packages, container images, IaC components, and cloud infrastructure components.
* CycloneDX output follows the scheme outlined for XML version 1.4.

==== SBOM in CSV Format

Generating an SBOM in CSV format from the CI/CD pipeline will generate three separate files:

* YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_iac.csv
* YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_container_images.csv
* YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_oss_packages

Where YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS is the timestamp for when the CSV was generated, for example: 20220801-221830_iac.csv. This file displays the following data for each IaC finding:

* Resource name
* Path
* Git Organization
* Git Repository
* Misconfigurations
* Severity

The list also displays resources without any misconfigurations. In these cases, the fields Misconfigurations and Severity will be empty.

==== SBOM in CycloneDX Format

The CycloneDX output is a single file including several main sections:

* Metadata
* Components
* Dependencies
* Vulnerabilities

The output for each section is demonstrated in the images below.
