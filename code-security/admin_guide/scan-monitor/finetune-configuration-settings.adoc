== Fine Tune Your Configuration Settings

Once your code repositories are integrated, you can modify your configuration to specify how Prisma Cloud scans your code. This includes:

* <<_exclude-paths-from-code-security-scans, Exclude Paths from Code Security Scans>>
* <<_enable-code-reviews, Enable Code Reviews>>
* <<_enable-pull-request-bot-comments, Enable Pull Request Bot Comments>>
* <<_enable-notifications, Enable Notifications>>
* <<_enable-tagging-bot, Enable Tagging Bot>>

[#_exclude-paths-from-code-security-scans]
=== Exclude Paths from Code Security scans

Configure your code security scan by adding rules to an integrated repository.
New rules are scanned only for a single defined repository.
However, you can configure multiple repositories to a defined rule.

By default, Prisma Cloud scans all paths in all repositories.
You can add a rule to specify which repository paths to exclude when scanning.
Before you begin adding rules, disable the default configuration for all repositories.

[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Code Configuration* to configure your integrated repository.

. Enable repositories to scan.

.. Select specific repositories *From Repositories*.
+
image::_excludepaths.png[width=400]

. Enter paths to exclude from the repository.

.. Type paths to exclude within the selected repository.
+
Use comma (,) to list more than one file or path.
+
In this example, On Enter Paths, type ‘ test, _test, \/test\/’ this will exclude any path or file with the specified context.

[#_enable-tagging-bot]
=== Enable Tagging Bot

Enable Tagging bot to be notified when a PR is committed to the default branch with a new IaC code. You can add traceability tags to your repositories that help locate runtime resources based on a specific IaC code and also trace the difference between cloud and code repositories. The tagging of a repository can be done manually, automatically (using Yor), or by using Prisma Cloud Tagging bot (Via Yor).
The yor_trace tag is a unique identifier indicating the git commit in combination with the specific IaC resource, it has initial support for Terraform, CloudFormation, and Serverless, Yor adds tags to IaC configurations that carry over to running cloud resource tags, for more details on yor, see here
By default, Tagging Bot is disabled.

You can exclude paths from scanning. Before you begin, disable the default configuration for all repositories.

[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Code Configuration* and enable repositories you want to scan.
+
image::_taggingbot.png[width=600]

. Enable repositories you want to scan.

.. Select specific repositories *From Repositories*.
+
