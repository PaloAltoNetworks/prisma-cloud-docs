== Drift Detection

Prisma Cloud Code Security supports Drift Detection for your repositories.
Drifts are inconsistencies in configuration that occur when resources are modified manually using the cloud CLI or console, and these divergences from the code are not recorded or tracked. The inconsistencies in code configuration can either be an addition or deletion of  values from the template configuration in source code.
Code Security periodically scans your repositories to identify drifts that may occur between the build and run phase and enables you with corrective solutions to handle traceable configuration changes.

Drift detection is currently available only for resources that are deployed using Terraform and CloudFormation on AWS and Azure and in private repositories. Support for resources deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) templates are not yet available.

For each drift detection scan, you can view the following details for a resource block.

1. Resource Block and Resource Name
+
The drift detection scan identifies the resource block and name. The resource block is the grouping of configuration or settings associated with a given resource.
2. Before Drift
+
The original or unchanged configuration changes of the resource.
3. After Drift
+
The modified configuration changes you made either locally or manually to the resource block with the changes that include adding or deleting a value within code, appear on the console. The configuration changes include any modification of add or delete values within code.
4. Resource History
+
The audit trail of configuration changes made to a resource that helps you review the updates anytime. This includes configuration changes of adding or deleting a value, and xref:monitor-fix-issues-in-scan/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan.adoc[fixing scan issues] within code.

=== Set up Drift Detection

For a drift detection scan to run on your repository you need to connect your AWS and Azure cloud account and code repositories to Prisma Cloud.
After you connect the repository setup https://yor.io/[Yor] on your repository and xref:iac-tag-and-trace.adoc[enable tag and trace management]. 
The yor_trace tag must be unique for the resource and not used in another Prisma Cloud tenant or copied from a public demo repository without updating this tag.
+
If you use CloudFormation templates, Yor tags are not needed for CloudFormation templates that are connected to your AWS account. You automatically, start to see drifts violations on the Projects page as soon as Prisma Cloud detects a gap between the the runtime and build time resources. If the CloudFormation template has been modified in code but not yet deployed, drift will not be detected until it is deployed.

* Onboard your AWS and Azure cloud account and code repositories to Prisma Cloud.
+
The AWS and Azure cloud account and code repositories must be connected to Prisma Cloud. For more details to onboard your cloud accounts see, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account[AWS] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account[Azure] and then xref:../get-started/connect-your-repositories/connect-your-repositories.adoc[Connect Your Repositories to Code Security] that hosts the Terraform and CloudFormation templates used to deploy resources on the AWS and Azure cloud account.
+
If you have previously onboarded your AWS cloud account on Prisma Cloud, you must enable the additional permissions required for a drift detection scan. See https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/update-an-onboarded-aws-account[update an onboarded AWS account] for redeploying the stack with the required permissions that are included in the `AWSCloudFormationReadOnlyAccess` policy.

Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

* Set up Yor
+
Yor is an open-source tool that helps you manage tags consistently across infrastructure as code frameworks on your CI/CD. To set up Yor for your repository you need to install and run Yor and then enable Yor to scan your repository for a drift detection scan.
+
* Install and Run Yor.
+
You can choose to install Yor either through a https://yor.io/2.Using%20Yor/installation.html[GitHub Actions or GitLab CI].
+
* Enable Yor on the Prisma Cloud console.
+
Enable automated resource trace tags to a new or modified IaC resource blocks using *Code Security > Projects > Manage tags* to enable the `yor_trace` tag. For further details on how to manage tags see xref:iac-tag-and-trace.adoc[IaC Tag and Trace].

=== Manage Drift

You can manage drift detection scan results for your repository either through Suppress or Fix Drift.

[.procedure]

. Review  drift detection scan results for your repository.

.. Select *Code Security > Projects*.
+
image::drift-1.png[width=600]

.. Select a repository.
+
image::drift-2.png[width=600]

.. Select *Category > Drift* to view the drift detection scan results within your repository.

. Take action to manage drift detection scan results.
+
You can either Suppress or Fix Drift.

* *Suppress*
+
Enables you to revert a resource block to its previous configuration change before any local or manual modifications. With suppression, you can enforce the configuration as defined in the IaC template and revert any changes to the running resource.
+
image::drift-3.png[width=600]
+
Suppressing a drift will continue to display the drift detection result until the next scan where the running resource is compliant and the drift is fixed.
* *Fix Drift*
+
Enables you to apply the configuration change that includes the manual changes made to the resource block, within  the template. Fix Drift creates a PR (Pull Request) directly from your code to implement configuration changes on the template. When you fix drift, you correct the template configuration to match the running configuration of the resource.

=== Create Alert Rules for Detecting Drift

An alert rule for Drift Detection generates alerts when a drift occurs for resources deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure.
When creating a drift alert rule, you must specify the account groups for which you would like to receive alerts and include the policies for which you want to generate alerts. 
// You can create a single alert rule that includes all account groups and policies. You can also customize alert rules to include details like Policy Severity, Policy Compliance or Policy Label with regions, and even resource tags.

Support for resources deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is not yet available.
// You can create a single rule alert for all account groups or choose to customize an alert rule for a specific requirement.

[.procedure]

. Verify that the policies for AWS and Azure are enabled.

.. Select *Policies* and verify if the specific policies are enabled for AWS and Azure cloud accounts.
In this example, the policy `AWS traced resources are manually modified` is enabled.
+
image::drift-5.png[width=600]

. Add an alert rule.

.. Select *Alerts > Alert Rules* and then select *Add Alert Rules*.
+
image::drift-6.png[width=600]

. Add details to create an alert rule for the configuration build policy.

.. Add a name for the drift alert rule.
+
You can optionally add a description.
+
image::drift-7.png[width=600]
+
NOTE: Drift alerts currently support alert notifications only. Support for Auto- Remediation is currently not available.

.. Select *Next*.

.. Select *Account Groups* to apply the alert rule.
+
You can select all groups or pick select groups to include or exclude.
+
image::drift-9.png[width=600]
+
You can optionally add additional criteria to the alert rule:

* *Exclude Cloud Accounts*: You can select cloud accounts to be excluded from the alert rule. You will not receive an alert for the selected accounts.

* *Include Regions*: Select regions to include to receive alerts.

* *Include Resource Tags*: Add the Key and Value of the resource tag to receive alerts for the specific resources in the cloud accounts.
+
image::drift-10.png[width=600]

.. Select *Next*.

. Assign policies.

.. Select the policies for which you want to generate alerts.
+
In this example, policy `AWS traced resources are manually modified` is assigned to the alert rule.
+
image::drift-11.png[width=600]
+
You can optionally search for specific policies to enable drift alerts.
+
In this example, using the word ‘traced’ to search for policy `Traced Azure resources are manually modified`.
+
image::drift-12.png[width=600]
+
NOTE: It is recommended to apply the alert rules with granular selection to avoid many alerts if the rule is applied for all policies.

.. Select *Next*.

. Review and save the alert rule.
+
.. View the detailed summary of the alert rule to verify the granular details before you *Save* your changes.

=== View Drift Alerts on Prisma Cloud

Prisma Cloud generates alerts on drifts detected for policies included in the alert rule monitoring AWS and Azure cloud resources for runtime resources that deviate in configuration from IaC templates used to deploy these resources.

[.procedure]

. Select *Alerts > Alerts Overview*.

. Search or filter the policy in the list.
+
In this example, using the word ‘traced’ to search for `AWS traced resources are manually modified.`
+
image::drift-16.png[width=600]

. Select *Alert Count* to view the alerts with granular information.
+
In this example, for the `AWS traced resources are manually modified` policy, there are 15 alert counts. Accessing each alert gives you granular information for each drift alert with IaC Resource Details.
+
image::drift-17.png[width=600]

. Select *Resource Name* to view information on drifts identified in a specific resource.

. Select *Alert ID* to view the traceability of drifts within the resource.
+
For each drift alert, you can view the following details.

* *Resource Name*
+
When selecting a  resource name within the drift policy violation, you can view granular information about the resource and when and where the resource is likely to be modified.
+
Using the information here on *Details, Audit Trail, Alerts, Findings* and *Relationship* you can understand where the drift may originate.
+
image::drift-18.png[width=600]

* *Alert ID*
+
When selecting an alert ID within a resource where the drift policy violation occurs, you can view granular information on the time and status of the alert across *Overview, Traceability, Alert Rules, Resource Config, Action Log,* and *Attribution Event*.
+
In *Overview* you can see *Details* and *IaC Resource Details* which include information on IaC Framework the resource is using, *Git Provider* and *Git Organization* from where the resource is hosted, including the IaC filename, last modification information and update.
+
image::drift-19.png[width=600]
+
In *Traceability* you can see Details and Build-time Resource which include information on the resource IaC State, if the resource has drifted or not. Traceability tag includes the `yor_trace` tag that Prisma Cloud uses to trace drifts using Checkov. In summary on the build-time resource you can see *Repository, File Path* and *Resource* the alert originates.
+
image::drift-20.png[width=600]
+
Using *View Drift Details*, you can access the drift on *Code Security > Projects* and choose to *Fix* or *Suppress* the drift (if the status is open). You can also choose to view the alert origin on the AWS or Azure cloud platform by selecting *View in Console*.
+
image::drift-21.png[width=600]

* *Dismiss and Snooze*
In addition to monitoring which resource you choose to receive an alert,  you choose to Dismiss or Snooze an alert within a policy violation.
In this example, you see the Dismiss and Snooze actions corresponding to the resource and  alert ID.
+
image::drift-22.png[width=600]

** *Dismiss*: You can manually dismiss an alert even when the issue is not resolved with a mandatory reason for dismissing the alert. You can choose to reopen a dismissed alert if needed manually. Alerts that are manually dismissed remain *Dismissed* even when the same policy violation reoccurs.
+
image::drift-23.png[width=400]
+
** *Snooze*: You can temporarily snooze an active alert for a specific period with a mandatory reason for snoozing the alert. At the expiration of the specific timer, the alert automatically changes to an *Open* or *Resolved* status depending on if the drift was fixed.
+
image::drift-24.png[width=400]
+
NOTE: Suppressing a drift on Projects parallelly suppresses a drift alert rule configured.

=== Troubleshooting drift detection

The following are the most common reasons drift has not been detected.
+
* The repository with the code or the cloud account with the runtime resource has not been onboarded.
+
* The Prisma Cloud role does not have the proper permissions listed above to detect drift.
+
* The repository is public. Use a private repository instead.
+
* The yor_trace ID has been copied from another onboarded repository.
+
* The CloudFormation has changes that have not been deployed.
+
* The drift policy has been disabled on the Policies page. There are currently three policies for Drift Detection: `AWS traced resources are manually modified`, `AWS provisioned resources are manually modified`, `Traced Azure resources are manually modified`.
