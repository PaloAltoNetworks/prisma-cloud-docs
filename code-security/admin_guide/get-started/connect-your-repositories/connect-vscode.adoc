== Connect VScode with Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating VScode (Visual Studio Code) with Prisma Cloud Code Security makes it possible for you to identify misconfigurations before you commit your code, and avoid pull requests that can potentially fail builds due to undetected misconfigurations. Using Checkov, a code analysis tool that scans Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files from frameworks such as Terraform_plan, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Secrets, Serverless, Dockerfile (only code), and Kubernetes on VScode (Visual Studio Code) gives you immediate detection of misconfigurations and inline code fixes.
Apart from the scanning the default Prisma Cloud policies, Checkov also scans for policy violations in custom policies that you can configure during <<_add-a-new-custom-policy-for-build-time-checks,custom build-time checks>>.


[.procedure]

. Verify the pre-requisites.
+
For VScode (Visual Studio Code), get the details for enabling authentication to Prisma Cloud.
+
* *Access Key.*
+
The access key enables access to Prisma Cloud. If you do not have the access key, refer to <<_generate-access-keys,generate access keys>>.
+
* *Secret Key.*
+
The secret key generates with your access key. Save your secret key when you generate it, as you cannot view it again on Prima Cloud.
+
* *Python Installation.*
+
Checkov needs Python to run, install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python version 3.7] or above. If you have a versatile working environment of both pip and virtual environment install https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv] or https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker].
+
* *Prisma Cloud API URL.*
+
When you configure Checkov plugin to VScode (Visual Studio Code) you need Prisma Cloud API URL. The URL for Prisma Cloud varies depending on the region and cluster on which your tenant is deployed. The tenant provisioned for you is, for example, https://app2.prismacloud.io or https://app.eu.prismacloud.io. For Prisma Cloud API URL, replace *app* in the URL with *api*.

. Access VScode (Visual Studio Code) on Prisma Cloud Code Security.

.. Select *Settings > Repositories > Add Repositories*.

.. Select *VScode*.

.. Add your Prisma Cloud access key and secret key as *"Access Key::Secret Key"* for *Checkov:Token*.
+

+
You can optionally choose to add a custom CA-Certificate and enter the certificate path to configure for *Checkov:Certificate*. Ensure your CA-Certificate is in ".pem" format.
+

+
A Checkov scan runs each time you access a file on VScode (Visual Studio Code).

. Fix scanned files for policy misconfiguration in build-time checks.

.. Select a file. Checkov runs an immediate scan on the file.

.. View the highlighted policy misconfiguration inline.
+

.. Select *Quick Fix* to fix the misconfiguration inline.
+
You can optionally select *View Problem* to know more about the misconfiguration.
+

+
Each misconfiguration has details on the policy violation and guidelines to fix the policy. See https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/aws-policy-index[here] to know more about each of misconfigurations in all supported environments. For custom policy and out-of-the-box misconfigurations you can access the Prisma Cloud Administrator console to know more.

=== Troubleshoot Logs

In case of a Checkov scan fail, you can access Checkov logs to know see more details.

. Access VScode (Visual Studio Code) *Command Palette* or enter *Ctrl + Shift + P* for Windows or *Cmd + Shift + P* for Mac and then run command  *Developer: Open Extensions Logs Folder*.

. Access *Bridgecrew.checkov > checkov.log* to see the log details.
