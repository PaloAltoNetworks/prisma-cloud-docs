== Add Azure Pipelines to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with your Azure Pipeline allows you to scan your infrastructure as code (IaC) and code repositories as a part of your CI/CD workflows. This will also provide reporting and tracking in the Prisma Cloud Console. As a prerequisite, make sure you have your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/get-started/generate-access-keys[Prisma Access Key and Prisma Secret Key] available.

[.procedure]

. In Azure DevOps, create a new pipeline or select an existing pipeline and select edit. This will open an editor for the `azure-pipelines.yml` configuration file.

+

. Add the following steps to your pipeline jobs or stages (depending on your existing configuration)
+
```yaml
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.8'
  displayName: 'Install Python 3.8'
- script: pip install checkov
  displayName: 'Install Checkov'
- script: checkov -d <directory> --bc-api-key <prisma_access_key>::<prisma_secret_key> --repo-id <org/repo> --branch <branch>
  displayName: 'Scan with Prisma Cloud'
  env:
    PRISMA_API_URL: <prisma_stack_api>
```
+
This includes the following arguments:

* <directory> - the directory of the repository you wish to scan.
* <prisma_access_key>::<prisma_secret_key> - a combination of your Prisma Access Key and Prisma Secret Key. These are best stored in a vault.
* <org/repo> - your VCS organization name and repository name.
* <branch> - the branch you are scanning.
* <prisma_stack_api> - the API URL for your Prisma Cloud stack. The list of URLs can be found https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console[here].
+
You can scan the build without failing the Prisma Cloud step by adding the `--soft-fail` option.
+
https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html[Additional settings] are available to be added to the scan.
+
Results are surfaced both in the pipeline logs and in Prisma Cloud.

Below is an example of a pipeline that implements Prisma Cloud's scan.
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pr:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: AzureKeyVault@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'pipeline-connection'
    keyVaultName: 'ts-pipeline-vault'
    secretsFilter: '*'
    runAsPreJob: false
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.8'
  displayName: 'Install Python 3.8'
- script: pip install checkov
  displayName: 'Install Checkov'
- script: checkov -d . --bc-api-key $(prisma-access-key)::$(prisma-secret-key) --repo-id prismaiac/bicepgoat --branch main
  displayName: 'Scan with Prisma Cloud'
  env:
    PRISMA_API_URL: https://api.prismacloud.io
```
