== Add Checkov to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with Checkov makes it possible for Prisma Cloud Code Security to scan your infrastructure as code files (Terraform and CloudFormation), display Incidents on the Console and, optionally, cause a build to fail.
For more details, see https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Visualizing%20Checkov%20Output.html[Checkov]

You can optionally choose to add the Branch details. If a target branch is not specified, the Code Security scans the master branch.

You can use the wizard to generate a command to run in your CLI tool for Checkov's most common use-case.
