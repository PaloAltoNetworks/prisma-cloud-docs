== Add Jenkins to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with Jenkins makes it possible for Prisma Cloud Code Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files, display Incidents on the Console and, optionally, cause a build to fail.
Jenkins is an extremely powerful and customizable tool. There are many ways to integrate Jenkins with a code repository to trigger builds. This page gives examples, but it is very likely that you will need to adapt these examples to your environment.
