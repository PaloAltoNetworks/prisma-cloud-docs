== Add Terraform Enterprise (Run Tasks)

Integrate Prima Cloud with Terraform Enterprise (Run Tasks) to enforce the policy as a code framework for Terraform https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/workspaces[workspaces] that use https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/sentinel[Sentinel language] with a predefined https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/sentinel/manage-policies#enforcement-levels[enforcement level] that prevents any risky Terraform run. With Terraform Enterprise (Run Tasks) integration, Prisma Cloud will scan your Terraform frameworks for any misconfiguration in Prisma Cloud default policies, out-of-the-box policies and custom policies.

Terraform always performs runs for a workspace. Therefore, the workspace serves as a working directory when running Terraform locally, providing the configuration, state, and variables for the run. Each workspace is associated with a particular Terraform configuration, where Terraform Cloud maintains a queue for runs and processes those runs in order. Each run passes through multiple run stages (pending, plan, cost estimation, policy check, apply, and completion), and this integration communicates the status of the run (either pass or fail) that is accessible on the Prisma Cloud console.

. Verify the prerequisites.
+
For Terraform Enterprise (Run Tasks) integration get the details for enabling authentication to Prisma Cloud.
+
* *Terraform Enterprise Console*
+
Access to Terraform Enterprise console enables you to provide user token that authorizes Prisma Cloud to access workspaces and helps regulate run configuration in Terraform console.
+
* *Terraform Cloud Enterprise version*
+
Run Tasks for workspaces on Terraform Cloud is compatible with version 1.1.9 and above. Ensure your Terraform Cloud version is compliant with the requirement.
+
* *Terraform Cloud Enterprise user permission*
+
For a workspace integration of run tasks you need https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions#organization-permissions[organization permission to manage workspace].
