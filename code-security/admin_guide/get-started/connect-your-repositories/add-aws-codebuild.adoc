== Add AWS Code Build to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrate Prisma Cloud Code Security with AWS Code Build to scan your Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) files, view incidents on the console, and configure whether or not a build fails based on the severity of the violation.
As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

A buildspec is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. Save this file in the root (top level) directory.
