== Add Prisma Cloud Code Security Scanner as a Pre-Receive Hook

Integrate the Prisma Code Security scanner as a pre-receive hook into your workflows using Checkov CLI to automate the scanning of your code for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) issues and Secrets vulnerabilities. This integration allows you to identify issues and remediation before accepting the code into your repositories. By doing so, you mitigate the risk of introducing potential issues downstream, ensuring the quality and security of your codebase.
Pre-receive hooks are server-side hooks in version control systems (VCS) that are triggered on the server when receiving a push or a specific action is performed, and these hooks enable you to enforce checks or actions before accepting any changes into the VCS.

NOTE: The terminology and implementation of pre-receive hooks may vary across different version control systems such as GitHub and GitLab.

The Prisma Cloud Code Security pre-receive hook is supported on the following systems:

* <<local-host,Local Host>>
* <<github-enterprise-server,GitHub Enterprise Server>>
* <<#github-self-managed,GitLab Self-Managed>>

[#local-host]
=== Install Prisma Code Security Pre-Receive Hook on a Local Host

[.procedure]

. Fulfill the following requirements before installing the Prisma Code Security pre-receive hook on your local host:
* Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] v3.7 - v3.11
* Install https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]
* Install https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/get-started/connect-your-repositories/add-checkov[Checkov]
* Verify Administrator access to the Version Control System (VCS) server and console

. Clone the repository: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov-pre-receive-hooks.

. Navigate to the local folder housing the cloned repository and run the following command to build the image from the *Dockerfile.dev* file:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t pre-receive.dev
----

. Add executable permissions to the checkov-pre-receive.sh file:
+
[source,shell]
----
chmod +x prisma-pre-receive.sh
----

. Run a data container with a generated SSH key:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run --name data pre-receive.dev /bin/true
----

. Copy the script to the data container:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker cp prisma-pre-receive.sh data:/home/git/test.git/hooks/pre-receive
----
+
NOTE: See <<pre-receive-hook-script,Pre-receive Hook Script>> for more information.

. Run an application container to execute the hook:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run -d -p 52311:22 --volumes-from data pre-receive.dev
----

. Copy the generated SSH key to your local machine:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker cp data:/home/git/.ssh/id_ed25519
----


. Test the hook: Make a commit in a local repository and run the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
git remote add test git@127.0.0.1:test.git
$ GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 52311 -i ../id_ed25519" git push -u test main
