== Add Bitbucket to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with Bitbucket makes it possible for Prisma Cloud Code Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files (Terraform and CloudFormation) and monitor configuration issues in development.

* Setup access to specific Bitbucket repositories.
+
As a best practice, enable access to all your Bitbucket repositories to ensure your Terraform and CloudFormation files can be scanned for adherence to security and compliance checks. If you want to enable access to the whole workspace.
However, if you want to restrict access to only a set of specified repositories in your Bitbucket Workspace, complete the following setup on Bitbucket.

Choose a Bitbucket user.

    * The user can be an existing user or a new user you created for this purpose. For example, PrismaCloudCodeSecurity@mycompany.com.
    * In *Bitbucket> Repository Settings* give the user *Write access* to the relevant repositories. Bitbucket sends a confirmation email to the user. Access the email and confirm authorize access.
    * Log in to Bitbucket with the relevant user credentials before you add Bitbucket to Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud uses OAuth for authorizing access,you must log in to Bitbucket with the relevant user credentials to ensure that the authentication is successful.

As a prerequisite you are required to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].
