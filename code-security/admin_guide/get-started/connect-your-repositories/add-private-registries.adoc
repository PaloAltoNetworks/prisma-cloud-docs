== Add Private Registries to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Private Registries with Prisma Cloud enables you to build an accurate dependency tree of the packages in your private registries. Using an *Artifactory* for integration ensures you have visibility into packages of your private registry and fix suggestions for vulnerabilities found in indirect packages.
To remediate vulnerabilities found on Private registries see results and fix suggestions on *Projects*. Alternatively, you can make an informed decision by seeing the scan results on *Supply Chain*, where the graph displays the dependency tree based on the integration.


[.procedure]

. Verify prerequisites.
+
For the Private Registries integration on Prisma Cloud Code Security, ensure you have the necessary permissions and Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname on an allow list.
+
* Access to the Prisma Cloud console.
+
Ensure private registries have access to the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname. For more information see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].
+
* Permissions required to see scan results after integration.
+
On the console after integration and a scan, you can see the scan results for Private registries at two instances.
+
* *Projects*: See the dependency trees for Software Composition Analysis (SCA) after integrating private registries.
* *Supply Chain*: See the dependency tree on Supply Chain after the integration to make an informed decision about vulnerabilities and package use.

. Integrate Private Registries with Prisma Cloud.

.. Select *Settings > Repositories > Add Repository > Private Registries*.

.. Select *Artifactory*.

+
NOTE: The permissions associated with the username determine the scan results for private registries.

.. Select *Next*.

. Add Package Manager to configure registry scans on the console.

.. Select a *Package Manager* to configure as a default integration.
+

NOTE: NPM requires you to define your repository is `Private`. For Maven, you can select *Mirror Registry* if the repository is a mirror of an existing repository.

.. Select *Add Package*.
+

.. Select *Done*.
+
Access *Settings > Repositories* to see the latest list of Private Registries integrations.
+
//To remediate scan results for private registries.
//+
Access *Code Security > Projects > Vulnerabilities* to see the scan results of private registries integrations to remediate vulnerabilities.
+
NOTE: After a private registry integration, the registry is a default reference for package versions on the console. Therefore, if a private fix version for the registry is not available, then recommendation on the console will be a public fix version.
+
Additionally, you can access *Code Security > Supply Chain* to view the dependency tree of the private packages.
+
Optionally, you can choose to delete a private registry integration on the console. Access *Settings > Repositories > Add Repository > Private Registries > Artifactory* and then select *Delete*.
