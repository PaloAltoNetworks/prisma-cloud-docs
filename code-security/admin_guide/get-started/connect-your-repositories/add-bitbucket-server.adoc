== Add Bitbucket Server to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating Prisma Cloud with Bitbucket Server makes it possible for Prisma Cloud Code Security to scan your Infrastructure-as-code files like Terraform and CloudFormation and monitor configuration issues in development.

Bitbucket Server is combination of Git server and a web interface built with Apache Maven. The usage of Bitbucket Server is similar to Git however, you can use the Bitbucket Server web application to control the read-and-write permissions to your code on Git.

To ensure network reachability between your Bitbucket Server environment and Prisma Cloud Code Security as a prerequisite you must add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

The hostname or IP address you provide must also be resolvable on the public DNS.

NOTE: The Bitbucket Server integration on Prisma Cloud supports Bitbucket Data Center and Server version 6.7 and above.

.. Add *Permissions*.
+
By default, the access token's permissions are set similar to your current level of access. You need to define two levels of permissions - *Project permissions* and *Repository permission*. Repository permission inherits the Project permissions; thus, Repository permission should be as high as the Project permission. For example, if you have a Project write permission, you should also have a Repository write permission. You can always modify or revoke token permissions. If you need to know more about the Project and Repository permissions, see https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0717/personal-access-tokens-1087535496.html[here].

.. Add *Expiry*.
+
For additional security set the token to automatically expire. Once a token has been created, it's expiry date cannot be changed. You can see the expiry dates for all your tokens on *Profile picture > Manage account > Personal access tokens*.
