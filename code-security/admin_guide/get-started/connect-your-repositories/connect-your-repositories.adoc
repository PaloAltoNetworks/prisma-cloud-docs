== Connect Your Repositories to Code Security

The Code Security capabilities support a wide range of Cloud DevSecOps, Integrated Development Environments ( IDEs), and CI/CD pipelines that you use to build and deploy code and infrastructure for your organization.

Before you begin adding your development environments and pipelines and start scanning these environments, begin with <<_generate-access-keys,generate access keys>> to enforce permissions for a specific users and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to Prisma Cloud Console] to allow whitelisting of IP addresses and hostnames that are used by different components which comprise the service.

=== Add Repositories and CI/CD Pipelines

To add  the environments that host your templates and source code, begin at *Settings > Repositories*.

The *Repositories* page is blank before you add any environments. The page continues to support the ability to add repositories and access the catalog of all different environments where you can scan for security and compliance violations using the Code Security integrations.

After you add one or more environments, you can view details of the repositories you have added, sort, search, or delete within the list.
