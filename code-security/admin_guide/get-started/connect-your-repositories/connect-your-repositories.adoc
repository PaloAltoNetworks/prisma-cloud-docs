== Connect Your Repositories to Code Security

The Code Security capabilities support a wide range of Cloud DevSecOps and Integrated Development Environments ( IDEs), and CI/CD pipelines that you use to build and deploy code and infrastructure for your organization.

Before you begin adding your development environments and pipelines for scanning, you must first <<_generate-access-keys,generate access keys>> to allow permissions for specific users. You also need to add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Code Security to an allow list, to https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console.html#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-%20b074-063158eeec08[enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console].

=== Add Repositories and CI/CD Pipelines

To add  the environments that host your templates and source code, begin at *Settings > Repositories*.

The *Repositories* page is blank before you add an environment. The page enables you to view the catalog of the different environments where you can scan for security and compliance violations using Code Security and add your integrations for monitoring with Prisma Cloud.

After you add one or more environments, you can view details of the repositories, sort, search, or delete within the list.

. Select *Settings > Repositories > Add Repository*.
