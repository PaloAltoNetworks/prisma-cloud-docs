== Add IntelliJ to Prisma Cloud Code Security

Integrating IntelliJ with Prisma Cloud Code Security makes it possible for you to identify misconfigurations before you commit your code, and avoid pull requests that can potentially fail builds due to undetected misconfigurations. Using Checkov, a code analysis tool that scans Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files from frameworks such as Terraform, Terraform_plan, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Secrets, Serverless, Dockerfile (only code), and Kubernetes on IntelliJ gives you immediate detection of misconfigurations and inline code fixes.
Apart from the scanning the common industry standard policies built in Checkov, scans for policy violations in custom policies that you can configure during <<_add-a-new-custom-policy-for-build-time-checks,custom build-time checks>> are also performed.

Before you begin with IntelliJ integration, you must first <<_generate-access-keys,generate access keys>> and have https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] version 3.7 or above installed, as Checkov runs on Python. Alternatively, https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv] or https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] is also recommended.
