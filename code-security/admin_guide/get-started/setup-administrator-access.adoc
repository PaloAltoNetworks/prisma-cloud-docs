== Set Up Administrator Access for Code Security

You need to enable administrative access for all the DevSecOps and Security teams who need to add code repositories or pipelines, create policies and review scan results on Prisma Cloud.
To know more see https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/prisma-cloud-administrator-roles.html[add Prisma Cloud Administrators] and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions.html[role permissions].

=== Add a Custom Permission Group

Administrators can create a custom permission group for Code Security on the Prisma Cloud console. Using the parameters for permissions, you can limit or enhance the responsibilities of the users.

* *Suppression Management*: You can enable user permissions to view, create, update and delete resources on *Repositories* (Settings > Repositories). These parameters enable suppression management for vulnerabilities found in resources. In addition, configuring view permission for all Code Security functions allows you to see the resource vulnerabilities to make informed decisions.

* *Code Security Configuration*: Enabling permissions for Code Security Configuration helps you manage Code Security licenses, Enforcement thresholds, notifications, developer suppressions and creating rules to exclude paths for scans.

=== View Audit Logs

Audit Logs enable organizations to meet compliance requirements by capturing administrator activities on the console as an initiative to tackle security issues while parallelly remediating them. Audit Logs proactively track configuration actions where modifying Enforcement parameters impact the scan results, and adding suppressing rules gives visibility into the current security posture.
In addition, actions on *Repositories* (Settings > Repositories), like adding, deleting or updating the repository selection, impact Projects that show you the scan results.
