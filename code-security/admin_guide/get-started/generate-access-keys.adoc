== Generate Access Key

Prisma Cloud uses Access Keys to integrate with the environments where you host your templates, source code, or pipelines.

Access keys are specific to a user and they enforce the role and permissions assigned to the specified user.

[NOTE]
====
When you are prompted to add an API Token on any plugin, make sure to provide your Prisma Cloud access key ID and secret as the input.
