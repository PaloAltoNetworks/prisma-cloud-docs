== Set up Developer Access for Code Security

You do not need to grant access for your developers to log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console. However, if you would like to enable access, Prisma Cloud includes a predefined developer role with the least privilege permissions to the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

The permissions for the developer role include the ability to:

* View scan results *(Code Security)* for repositories and perform functions to Suppress, Remediate, and Search for a specific Run or view Resource Explorer data.
* View the roles associated with the developer user account. *(Settings > Roles)*
* Create and modify access keys for the developer user account. *(Settings > Access Keys)*
* View their own user profile.


[.procedure]

. Select *Settings > Roles > Add Role*.
+
