=== Description

You can use environment variables to adjust your function's behavior without updating code.
An environment variable is a pair of strings that is stored in a function's version-specific configuration.
The Lambda runtime makes environment variables available to your code and sets additional environment variables that contain information about the function and invocation request.
Environment variables are not evaluated prior to the function invocation.
Any value you define is considered a literal string and not expanded.
Perform the variable evaluation in your function code.
