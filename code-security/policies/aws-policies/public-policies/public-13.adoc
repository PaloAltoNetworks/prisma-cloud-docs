=== Description 


AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a service for migrating relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL databases and other data stores.
DMS can be used to migrate data into the AWS Cloud, between on-premises instances, or between combinations of cloud and on-premises environments.
An AWS DMS replication instance can have one public IP address and one private IP address, just like an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that has a public IP address.
If you uncheck (disable) the box for Publicly accessible, then the replication instance has only a private IP address.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_dms_replication_instance
* *Arguments:* publicly_accessible - (Optional, Default: false) Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance.

A value of true represents an instance with a public IP address.
A value of false represents an instance with a private IP address.


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_dms_replication_instance" "test" {
  ...
  allocated_storage            = 20
+ publicly_accessible          = false
}
----


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::DMS::ReplicationInstance
* *Arguments:* Properties.PubliclyAccessible - (Optional, Default: false) Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance.

A value of true represents an instance with a public IP address.
A value of false represents an instance with a private IP address.
