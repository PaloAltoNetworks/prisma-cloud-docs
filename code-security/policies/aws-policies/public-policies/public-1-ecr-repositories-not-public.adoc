=== Description 


AWS ECR is a managed Docker registry service that simplifies Docker container image management.
The ECR repository is a collection of Docker images available on AWS.
Access control to ECR repositories is governed using resource-based policies.
A public ECR repository can expose internal Docker images that contain confidential business logic.
We recommend you do not allow unrestricted public access to ECR repositories to help avoid data leakage.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS console].

. Select *Amazon ECR **, then select **Repositories*.

. Click the image repository that you want to configure.
+
To modify the permission policy, select *Permissions*.

. In the *Permission statements*, select the _policy statement_ that has *Effect **set to **Allow* and *Principal* set to *****.

. To select a restricted access policy, click *Edit* and make changes.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::ECR::Repository
* *Argument:* Properties.RepositoryPolicyText.Statement.Principal
