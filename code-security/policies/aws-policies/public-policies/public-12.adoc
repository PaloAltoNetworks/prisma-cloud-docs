=== Description 


A public IP address is an IPv4 address that is reachable from the Internet.
You can use public addresses for communication between your instances and the Internet.
Each instance that receives a public IP address is also given an external DNS hostname.
We recommend you control whether your instance receives a public IP address as required.
