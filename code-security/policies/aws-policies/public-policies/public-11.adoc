=== Description 


Brokers created without public accessibility cannot be accessed from outside of your VPC.
This greatly reduces your broker's susceptibility to DDoS attacks from the internet.
Public Amazon MQ brokers can be accessed directly, outside of a VPC, allowing every EC2 on the Internet to reach your brokers through their public endpoints.
This can increase the opportunity for malicious activity such as cross-site scripting and clickjacking attacks.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/ [Amazon MQ console].

. In the * Select deployment and storage* page, in the * Deployment mode and storage type* section configure your MQ based on your specs.

. In the * Network and security * section, configure your broker's connectivity and select the * Public accessibility* of your broker.
+
Disabling public accessibility makes the broker accessible only within your VPC.
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_mq_broker
* *Arguments:* publicly_accessible - (Optional) Whether to enable connections from applications outside of the VPC that hosts the broker's subnets.
