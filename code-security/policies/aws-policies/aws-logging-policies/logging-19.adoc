=== Description 


The events recorded by the AWS DocumentDB audit logs include: successful and failed authentication attempts, creating indexes or dropping a collection in a database within the DocumentDB cluster.
AWS CloudWatch logs are a service that monitors, stores and accesses your log files from a variety of sources within your AWS account.
When logging is enabled information such as Data Definition Language, authentication, authorization, and user management events are sent to AWS CloudWatch logs.
This information can be used to analyze, monitor and archive your Amazon DocumentDB auditing events for security and compliance requirements.
