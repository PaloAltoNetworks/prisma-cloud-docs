=== Description 


Amazon MSK enables you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data.
It also provides a control-plane for advanced operations, for example, creating, updating, and deleting clusters.
Consistent cluster logging helps you determine if a  request was made with root or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials and whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


* New Cluster*:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/].

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/msk/ [Amazon MSK console].

. Go to * Broker Log Delivery* in the * Monitoring **section.

. Specify the destinations to which you want Amazon MSK to deliver your broker logs.
+
* Existing Cluster*:

. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/msk/ [Amazon MSK console] choose the cluster from your list of clusters.

. Go to the *Details **tab.
+
Scroll down to the * Monitoring * section and click * Edit*.

. Specify the destinations to which you want Amazon MSK to deliver your broker logs.


* CLI Command* 


When you use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kafka/create-cluster.html [create-cluster] or the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kafka/update-monitoring.html [update-monitoring] commands, you can optionally specify the logging-info parameter and pass to it a JSON structure.
In this JSON, all three destination types are optional.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_msk_cluster
* *Arguments:* logging_info - (Optional) Configuration block for streaming broker logs to Cloudwatch/S3/Kinesis Firehose.

See below.


[source,go]

{
 "resource "aws_msk_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_name           = "example"
  ...
+  logging_info {
+    broker_logs {

+        enabled   = true
+        log_group = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.test.name
      }

",
 
}

*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::MSK::Cluster
* *Argument:* LoggingInfo.
Configure your MSK cluster to send broker logs to different destination types.
This is a container for the configuration details related to broker logs.
