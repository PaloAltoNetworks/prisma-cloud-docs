=== Description 


Global Accelerator is a networking service that sends traffic through AWS's global network enabling global access to your web apps.
Flow logs allow capturing information about the IP address traffic going to and from network interfaces in the AWS Global Accelerator.
Flow log data is published to Amazon S3, where it can be retrieved and viewed.
Flow logs enable troubleshooting if specific traffic is not reaching an endpoint, helping you to diagnose overly restrictive security group rules.
It can also be used to monitor the traffic that is reaching endpoints in a VPC and establish if they should be receiving that traffic.

=== Fix - Runtime


* CLI Command* 



. Create an S3 bucket for your flow logs.

. Add an IAM policy for the AWS user who is enabling the flow logs.

. Run the following commands, with the S3 bucket name and prefix that you want to use for your log files:
