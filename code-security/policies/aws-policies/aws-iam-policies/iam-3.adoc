== Credentials unused for 90 days or greater are not disabled


=== Description 


AWS IAM users access AWS resources using different types of credentials, such as passwords or access keys.
We recommend that all credentials that have been unused for 90 or greater days be removed or deactivated.
Disabling or removing unnecessary password access to an account reduces the risk of credentials being misused.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console* 


To manually remove or deactivate credentials:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console as an *IAM user* at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

. Navigate to** IAM Services**.

. Select *Users*.

. Select *Security Credentials*.

. Select *Manage Console Password*, then select *Disable*.

. Click *Apply*.

. If there is an unused access key, disable or delete the key.
