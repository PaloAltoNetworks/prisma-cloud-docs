=== Description


IAM users and roles in your AWS accounts act as open attack surfaces into the account, and should be kept only when in use to reduce the risk that an entity will be used accidentally to allow unauthorized users to access AWS resources.
Unused AWS Admins are flagged as a critical finding if they meet one of the following criteria:

* The AWS managed policy *arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess* attached
* A policy with the action "*****" on all resources
* A policy with the action "*iam:**" on all resources.

We recommend you remove any IAM entities with admin privileges and unused in the last 90 days to prevent future admins from attaching them to unauthorized users.
