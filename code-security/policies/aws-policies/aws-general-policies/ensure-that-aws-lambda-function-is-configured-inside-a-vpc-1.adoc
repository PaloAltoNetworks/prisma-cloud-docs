=== Description 


By default, Lambda runs functions in a secure VPC with access to AWS services and the internet.
Lambda owns this VPC, which isn't connected to the account's default VPC.
Internet access from a private subnet requires Network Address Translation (NAT).
To give your function access to the internet, route outbound traffic to a NAT gateway in a public subnet.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_lambda_function
* *Arguments:* vpc_config.subnet_ids
* For network connectivity to AWS resources in a VPC, specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC.
When you connect a function to a VPC, it can only access resources and the internet through that VPC.
`subnet_ids` - List of subnet IDs associated with the Lambda function.
Note: If both subnet_ids and security_group_ids are empty then vpc_config is considered to be empty or unset.
