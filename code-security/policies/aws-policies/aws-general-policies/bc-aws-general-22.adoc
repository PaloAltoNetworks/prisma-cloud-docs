*Description* 


Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a streaming data pipeline service that can route messages to destinations such as S3, Redshift Elasticsearch and others.
It can also be used to transform data properties before streaming to a defined destination.
Kinesis enables server-side data encryption if the data stream contains sensitive information.
When sending data from a producer to a data stream Kinesis encrypts the data using an AWS KMS key before storing the data at rest.
We recommend you ensure Kinesis streams are encrypted using server-side encryption (SSE).

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Select **Services ** and search for Kinesis.

. Under the Amazon Kinesis dashboard select Data Firehose from the left navigation panel.

. Select the Firehose Delivery System that needs to be verified and click on the Name to access the delivery stream.

. Select the Details tab and scroll down to Amazon S3 destination.
+
Check the Encryption value and if it's set to Disabled then the selected Firehose Delivery System data is not encrypted.

. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to verify another Firehose Delivery System.

. To enable the Encryption on selected Firehose Delivery System click on the Name to access the delivery stream.
+
Under the *Details **tab, click **Edit* to make the changes in Amazon S3 destination.

. Click **Enable **next to the S3 encryption to enable the encryption.

. Select the KMS master key from the dropdown list.
+
Select the (Default( aws/s3 )) KMS key or an AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK).

. Click **Save **.
+
A Successfully Updated message appears.


*CLI Command* 


Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.

*Terraform* 


* *Resources:* aws_kinesis_stream
* *Arguments*: encryption_type - (Optional) The encryption type to use.
The only acceptable values are NONE or KMS.
The default value is NONE.
kms_key_id - (Optional) The GUID for the customer-managed KMS key to use for encryption.
You can also use a Kinesis-owned master key by specifying the alias alias/aws/kinesis.
