=== Description 


It is recommended to enable create_before_destroy argument inside the resource lifecycle configuration block to avoid possible return errors such as `BadRequestException: Active stages pointing to this deployment must be moved or deleted` on recreation.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*CloudFormation* 


CloudFormation creates a new deployment first and then will delete the old one automatically.


*Terraform*
