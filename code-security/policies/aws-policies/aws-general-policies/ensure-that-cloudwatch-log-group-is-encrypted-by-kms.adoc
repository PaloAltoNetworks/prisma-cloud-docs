=== Description 


Log group data requires mandatory encryption settings in CloudWatch Logs.
Developers can optionally use AWS Key Management Service for this encryption.

This approach has several limitations:

* If you revoke CloudWatch Logs access to an associated CMK or delete an associated CMK, your encrypted data in CloudWatch Logs can no longer be retrieved.
* You cannot associate a CMK with a log group using the CloudWatch console.
