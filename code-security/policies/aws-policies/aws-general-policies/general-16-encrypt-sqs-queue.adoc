=== Description 


Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) provides the ability to encrypt queues so sensitive data is passed securely.
It uses server-side-encrypyion (SSE) and supports AWS-managed Customer Master Key (CMK), as well as self-created/self-managed keys.
SSE encrypts only the body of the message, with queue metadata and message metadata out of scope, and backlogged messages not encrypted.
If you operate in a regulated market, such as HIPAA for healthcare, PCI DSS for finance, or FedRAMP for government, you need to ensure sensitive data messages passed in this service are encrypted at rest.
We recommend you encrypt Data Queued using SQS.

=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the * https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/ [Amazon SQS console]*.

. Open a Queue and click * Edit* at the top right.

. Expand * Encryption* and select * Enabled*.

. Select or enter a CMK key, or use the default provided by AWS.


* CLI Command* 


----
aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url & lt;QUEUE_URL> --attributes KmsMasterKeyId=& lt;KEY>
----
The format of the queue URL is `+https://sqs.REGION.amazonaws.com/ACCOUNT_ID/QUEUE_NAME+`
The key should be a KMS key or alias.
The default AWS key is `alias/aws/sqs`.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_sqs_queue
* *Arguments:*  kms_master_key_id - (Optional) The ID of an AWS-managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK.
kms_data_key_reuse_period_seconds - (Optional) The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again.
An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
The default is 300 (5 minutes).
