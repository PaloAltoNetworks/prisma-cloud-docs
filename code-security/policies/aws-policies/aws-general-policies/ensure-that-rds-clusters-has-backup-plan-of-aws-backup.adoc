=== Description 


Ensure that RDS clusters are included in your backup plans for the AWS Backup.
AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that helps you protect your data in the cloud by automatically backing up your data to a secure, durable storage location.
By creating a backup plan, you can ensure that your data is regularly backed up and can be recovered in the event of data loss or corruption.
