=== Description 


The log_fdw extension for Amazon Relational Database Service (AWS RDS) PostgreSQL instances allows you to query log files from foreign servers as if they were tables in a database.
However, certain versions of the log_fdw extension may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
By ensuring that your AWS RDS PostgreSQL instances use a non-vulnerable version of the log_fdw extension, you can help protect your database from potential security threats.
