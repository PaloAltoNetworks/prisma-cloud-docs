=== Description 


Ensuring that EC2 instances are EBS-optimized will help to deliver enhanced performance for EBS workloads.
They provide dedicated throughput to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, which can result in improved EBS performance.
Additionally, EBS-optimized instances use a separate network connection for EBS traffic, which can reduce network latency and improve the performance of EBS-intensive workloads.

=== Fix - Buildtime
