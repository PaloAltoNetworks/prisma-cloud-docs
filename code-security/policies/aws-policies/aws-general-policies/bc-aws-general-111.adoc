=== Description 


ElastiCache for Redis offers default (service managed) encryption at rest, as well as ability to use your own symmetric customer managed AWS KMS keys in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
Data stored on SSDs (solid-state drives) in data tiering enabled clusters is always encrypted by default.
However, when the cluster is backed up, the snapshot data is not automatically encrypted.
Encryption needs to be enabled on the snapshot.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_elasticache_replication_group
* *Attribute:* kms_key_id - (Optional) The ARN of the key that you wish to use if encrypting at rest.
If not supplied, uses service managed encryption.
Can be specified only if at_rest_encryption_enabled = true.
