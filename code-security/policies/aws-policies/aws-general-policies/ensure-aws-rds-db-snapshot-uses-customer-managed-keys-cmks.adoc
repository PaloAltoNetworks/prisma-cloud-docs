=== Description

This policy identifies database snapshots that were not encrypted with KMS.
It is a best practice to manage your own encryption keys for all storage volumes and snapshots.

////
=== Fix - Runtime
Changing the encryption method cannot be done for existing snapshots.
Instead, create a new snapshot and add the CMK encryption.

. Open the Amazon RDS console.

. In the navigation pane, choose Databases.

. Choose the DB instance for which you want to create a manual snapshot.

. Create a manual snapshot for your DB instance.

. In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots.

. Select the manual snapshot that you created.

. Choose Actions, and then choose Copy Snapshot.

. Under Encryption, select Enable Encryption.

. For AWS KMS Key, choose the new encryption key that you want to use.

. Choose Copy snapshot.

. Restore the copied snapshot.
