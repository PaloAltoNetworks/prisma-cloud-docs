== CloudFront distribution ViewerProtocolPolicy is not set to HTTPS


=== Description 


*AWS::CloudFront::Distribution ViewerCertificate* determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.
We recommend you use the *ViewerProtocolPolicy* parameter to enable secure HTTPS communication between clients and your CloudForamtion templates.
Most browsers and clients released after 2010 support server name indication.
AWS recommends to accept HTTPS connections only from viewers that support SNI and advises against receiving HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that do not support SNI, set SslSupportMethod.
This also results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* Procedure* 


Use * ViewerProtocolPolicy* in the * CacheBehavior* or * DefaultCacheBehavior*, and select * Redirect HTTP to HTTPS* or * HTTPS Only*.
To specify how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use * CustomOriginConfig*.
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resources:* aws_cloudfront_distribution
* *Arguments:*  `viewer_protocol_policy` under `default_cache_behavior` or `ordered_cache_behavior` must not be `allow-all`.
Acceptable values are `redirect-to-https` or `https-only`.
