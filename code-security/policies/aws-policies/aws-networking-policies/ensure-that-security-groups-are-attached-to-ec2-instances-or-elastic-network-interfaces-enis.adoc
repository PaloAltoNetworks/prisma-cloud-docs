=== Description 


Security groups are an important layer of security for Amazon EC2 instances and network interfaces (ENIs).
They act as a virtual firewall for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to and from your instances.
By attaching security groups to your EC2 instances or ENIs, you can specify which traffic is allowed to reach your instances, and which traffic is blocked.
This can help to protect your instances from unauthorized access and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
