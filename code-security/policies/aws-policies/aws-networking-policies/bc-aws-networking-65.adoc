== AWS CloudFront distribution does not have a strict security headers policy attached


=== Description

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers static and dynamic web content using a global network of edge locations.
CloudFront introduced response headers policies to address this need and give the customers more control in defining header modifications performed by CloudFront.
While it has been possible to manipulate response headers with CloudFront's edge serverless options, typically it doesn't require a custom logic unique to the use case.
