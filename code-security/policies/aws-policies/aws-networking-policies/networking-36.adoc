== ELBs do not use SSL listeners


=== Description 


Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) should use listeners that have encrypted protocols, for example, HTTPS.
However, it does not necessarily mean that only SSL listeners are available, for example, you can configure an HTTP to HTTPS redirect.
We recommend at least one SSL listener is available.
Providing a load balancer that does not serve encrypted traffic presents a security risk for any client connecting to the load balancer.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS EC2 Console* 



. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the *https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home[EC2 Console]* and select *Load Balancers*.

. Select the load balancer to update, and select the **Listeners **tab.

. For NLB and ALB objects, click** Add Listener**, or select an existing listener and click **Edit**, and select a protocol with SSL.
+
For Classic ELBs, click *Edit*, and add or update existing rows to use a protocol with SSL.
