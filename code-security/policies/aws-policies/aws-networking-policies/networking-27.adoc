== Uses default settings of a VPC


=== Description 


A default VPC is a logically isolated virtual network created automatically for your AWS account when you provision EC2 instances.
The default settings of a VPC are not suitable for applications that use multi-tier architectures.
We recommend you create a non-default _hardened_ VPC that suits its specific networking requirements.

=== Fix - Runtime


*CLI Command* 



. To list the existing default VPCs run a describe-vpcs command to return the ID of the default VPC created in the selected AWS region:
+
[,bash]
----
aws ec2 describe-vpcs
--region us-east-2
--query 'Vpcs[?(IsDefault==`true`)].VpcId | []'
----

. The command output should return the requested VPC identifier.

. Run the describe-instances command using the ID of the default VPC as a filter parameter and custom query filters to return the IDs of the EC2:
[,bash]
----
aws ec2 describe-instances
--region us-east-1
--filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-id"
--query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId[]'
----

. The command output should return the identifiers of the EC2 instances launched within the default VPC, alternatively it will return an empty array.

. To remove default VPCs that are not currently in use, use the delete-vpc command:
[,bash]
----
aws ec2 delete-vpc --vpc-id vpc-a01106c2
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must detach or delete all gateways and resources that are associated with the VPC before you can delete it.
