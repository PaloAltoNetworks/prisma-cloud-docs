=== Description

By ensuring that your AWS ELB policy only uses secure protocols, you can help prevent attackers from intercepting and reading sensitive information that is transmitted between your ELB and its clients.
This can help protect your network and data from various types of attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and other types of data interception.
