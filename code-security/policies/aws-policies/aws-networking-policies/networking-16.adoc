== Application load balancer has unrestricted security group attached


=== Description 


A publicly accessible load balancer is vulnerable to brute force login attempts and subsequent data leak/loss.
Unauthorized access attempts should be restricted to minimize security risks.
We recommend your load balancer can communicate with registered targets on both the listener port and the health check port.
Whenever you add a listener to your load balancer or update the health check port for a target group used by the load balancer to route requests, you must verify that the security groups associated with the load balancer allow traffic on the new port in both directions.
If they do not, you can edit the rules for the currently associated security groups or associate different security groups with the load balancer.

=== Fix - Runtime


*AWS Console*
