== Bucket ACL grants WRITE permission to AWS users


=== Description 


Unprotected S3 buckets are one of the major causes of data theft and intrusions.
An S3 bucket that allows *WRITE* access to AWS users allows attackers to create, overwrite and delete objects within the bucket, which can lead to: S3 data loss, unintended changes to applications using that bucket, and unexpected charges.
The only S3 buckets that should be globally accessible for unauthenticated users or for *Any AWS Authenticate Users* are those used for hosting static websites.
Bucket ACL helps manage access to S3 bucket data.
We recommend AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible for *WRITE* actions to protect S3 data from unauthorized users and exposing sensitive data to public access.

=== Fix - Runtime


*Procedure * 


S3 buckets should be protected by using the bucket ACL and bucket policies.
If you want to share data with other users via S3 buckets, you could create pre-signed URLs with a short expiration duration.
To generate a pre-signed URL for the file _samplefile.zip_, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3 presign --expires-in 36000 s3://sharedfolder/samplefile.zip
----

To generate pre-signed URLS for every object in an S3 bucket, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3 ls --recursive s3://sharedfolder | awk '{print $4}' |
while read line; do aws s3 presign --expires-in 36000 s3://sharedfolder/$line; done
----

NOTE: For all automation-related work use the bucket policy and grant access to the required roles.

*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket.data
* *Arguments:* acl
* *Repository*: try-bridgecrew/terragoat
* *File Name*: /terraform/s3.tf For example:


[source,json]
----
{
 "resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  # bucket is public
  # bucket is not encrypted
  # bucket does not have access logs
  # bucket does not have versioning
  bucket        = "${local.resource_prefix.value}-data"
  acl           = "public-read"
  force_destroy = true
  tags = {
    Name        = "${local.resource_prefix.value}-data"
    Environment = local.resource_prefix.value
  }

}",
