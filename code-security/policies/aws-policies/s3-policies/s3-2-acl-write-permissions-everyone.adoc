=== Description 


Unprotected S3 buckets are one of the major causes of data theft and intrusions.
An S3 bucket that allows *WRITE* access to everyone allows attackers to create, overwrite and delete objects within the bucket, which can lead to: S3 data loss, unintended changes to applications using that bucket, and unexpected charges.
The only S3 buckets that should be globally accessible for unauthenticated users or for *Any AWS Authenticate Users* are those used for hosting static websites.
Bucket ACL helps manage access to S3 bucket data.
We recommend AWS S3 buckets are not publicly accessible for *WRITE* actions to protect S3 data from unauthorized users and exposing sensitive data to public access.

=== Fix - Runtime


* Procedure* 


S3 buckets should be protected by using the bucket ACL and bucket policies.
If you want to share data with other users via S3 buckets, you could create pre-signed URLs with a short expiration duration.
To generate a pre-signed URL for the file _samplefile.zip_, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
aws s3 presign --expires-in 36000 s3://sharedfolder/samplefile.zip
----
----
To generate pre-signed URLS for every object in an S3 bucket, use the following command:
[,bash]
----
----
aws s3 ls --recursive s3://sharedfolder | awk '{print $4}' |
while read line; do aws s3 presign --expires-in 36000 s3://sharedfolder/$line; done
----

[NOTE]
====
For all automation-related work use the bucket policy and grant access to the required roles.

Replace the acl with "private" instead of "public-read-write", or remove entirely as the default is private.
