=== Description 

Including a number in a password is important as it adds complexity and makes it harder for attackers to guess or crack the password using automated tools. Using only uppercase or lowercase characters in a password makes it easier for attackers to perform a brute-force attack, where they try all possible combinations until they find the correct one. By including numbers, the number of possible combinations increases, making it more challenging for attackers to guess or crack the password. To mitigate this risk and prevent unauthorized access to an account, enforce a policy requiring passwords to include a number for Alibaba Cloud RAM accounts (account). This policy identifies accounts that do not include a number in their password policy.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 
To identify accounts with passwords that do not include a number, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.



[source,go]
----
{
 "
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "pass" {
  minimum_password_length      = 14
  require_lowercase_characters = false
  require_uppercase_characters = true
  require_numbers              = true
  require_symbols              = true
  hard_expiry                  = true
  max_password_age             = 14
  password_reuse_prevention    = 5
  max_login_attempts           = 3
}",

      "language": "go"
}
