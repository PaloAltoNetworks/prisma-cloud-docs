=== Description

Enabling the log_duration parameter in Alibaba Cloud RDS (Relational Database Service) instance can provide several benefits, including:

* *Performance tuning:* The log_duration parameter can help you identify and analyze slow queries that may be impacting the performance of your RDS instance.
By measuring the duration of each query, you can identify which queries are taking the longest time to execute and optimize them to improve overall performance.

* *Capacity planning:* The log_duration parameter can also help you with capacity planning by providing insights into the resource usage of your RDS instance.
By monitoring the duration of queries, you can identify which queries are consuming the most resources and plan accordingly for future growth and scaling.
