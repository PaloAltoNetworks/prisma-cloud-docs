=== Description

A key is a named object representing a cryptographic key used for a specific purpose, including data protection.
The key material, the actual bits used for encryption, can change over time as new key versions are created.
A collection of files could be encrypted with the same key and people with decrypt permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files.
We recommend you set a key rotation period.
A key can be created with a specified rotation period, which is the time when new key versions are generated automatically.
A key can also be created with a specified next rotation time.
