=== Description 


The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol secures transmission of data between servers and web browsers using standard encryption technology.
To follow security best practices and the latest PCI compliance standards, configure the Alibaba Cloud Cipher policy to enable the latest version of TLS protocol, which is TLS 1.2.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To enable support for the TLS v 1.2 protocol in your Alibaba Cloud Cipher policy, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.
