=== Description 


https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/auth-overview[AUTH] is an optional security feature on Memorystore for Redis that requires incoming connections to authenticate with an AUTH string.
Every AUTH string is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), and each Redis instance with AUTH enabled has a unique AUTH string.
When you enable the AUTH feature on your Memorystore instance, incoming client connections must authenticate in order to connect.
Once a client authenticates with an AUTH string, it remains authenticated for the lifetime of that connection, even if you change the AUTH string.
We recommend that you enble AUTH on your Memorystore for Redis database to protect against unwanted or non-approved connections.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console* 


To enable * AUTH* on your Memorystore for Redis database:

. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/memorystore/redis/instances [Memorystore for Redis].

. View your instance's _Instance details_ page by clicking on your * Instance ID*.

. Select the * EDIT* button.

. Scroll to the _Security section_ and select the checkbox for * Enable AUTH*.


* CLI Command* 


To enable * AUTH* on your Memorystore for Redis instance execute the following command:


[source,shell]
----
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "gcloud beta redis instances update INSTANCE-ID \\
  --enable-auth \\
  --region=REGION",
      "language": "shell",
      "name": "supported_resources"
    }
  ]
}
----
Replace * INSTANCE-ID* with your Memorystore for Redis instance ID.
Replace * REGION* with the region where your Memorystore for Redis database lives.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_redis_instance
* *Field:* auth_enabled


[source,go]

{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "resource "google_redis_instance" "cache" {
  name           = "memory-cache"
  display_name   = "memory cache db"
  tier           = "STANDARD_HA"
  memory_size_gb = 1

- auth_enabled = false
