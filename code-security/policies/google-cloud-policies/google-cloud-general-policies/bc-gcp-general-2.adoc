=== Description 


Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
It offers data encryption at rest and in transit, Private connectivity with VPC and user-controlled network access with firewall protection.
Backups provide a way to restore a Cloud SQL instance to recover lost data or recover from a problem with your instance.
We recommend you enable automated backups for instances that contain data of high importance.
