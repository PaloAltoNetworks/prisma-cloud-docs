GCP Container Registry repositories are anonymously or publicly accessible
*GCP Container Registry repositories are anonymously or publicly accessible* 

_Google Container Registry (GCR)_ is a GCP service that contains repositories for your container images.
A GCR repo is publicly accessible if the host location's underlying storage bucket is publicly accessible because GCR images are stored in GCS.
Public GCR repositories can put your data at risk of exposure and should be adjusted to a more secure configuration (private).
We recommend you ensure that neither anonymous or public access to *GCR Repositories* is allowed.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console* 


To remove anonymous or public access to your GCR repositories:

. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/settings [GCR Settings].

. Under _Public access_ locate the repositories that say * PUBLIC* under the _Visibility_ column.

. Select the dropdown and switch to * PRIVATE*.


* CLI Command* 


To remove anonymous or public access to your GCR repositories use the `gsutil` command:


[source,shell]
----
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "gsutil iam ch -d PRINCIPAL gs://BUCKET-NAME
",
      "language": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
----
Replace * PRINCIPAL* with either _allUsers_ or _allAuthenticatedUsers_ depending on your Checkov alert.
Replace * BUCKET-NAME* with the GCS bucket where your images are stored.
The * BUCKET-NAME* can be determined by executing `gsutil ls` and your Container Registry bucket URL will be listed as `gs://artifacts.PROJECT-ID.appspot.com` or `gs://STORAGE-REGION.artifacts.PROJECT-ID.appspot.com`.
* PROJECT-ID* and * STORAGE-REGION* will be replaced with your GCP project ID or the region where your GCR repository is configured.
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_storage_bucket_iam_binding
* *Field:* members
* *Resource:* google_storage_bucket_iam_member
* *Field:* member
Google Container Registry (GCR) does not have IAM-specific resources in Terraform.
Instead, GCR IAM is handled via GCS IAM resources as seen in the below examples.
