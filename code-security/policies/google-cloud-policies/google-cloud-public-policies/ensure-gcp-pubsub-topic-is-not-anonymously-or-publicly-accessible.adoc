== GCP Pub/Sub Topics are anonymously or publicly accessible

Pub/Sub is commonly used for asynchronous communication for applications in GCP.
Messages are published to a *Pub/Sub Topic* and the ability to publish a message is controlled via IAM policies.
It is possible to make *Pub/Sub Topics* publicly or anonymously accessible.
Public notification topics can expose sensitive data and are a target for data exfiltration.
We recommend you ensure that neither anonymous or public access to *Pub/Sub Topics* is allowed.

=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console* 


To remove anonymous or public access to your Pub/Sub Topic:

. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/list [Topics].

. Select the _Pub/Sub Topic checkbox_ next to your * Topic ID*.

. Select the * INFO PANEL* tab to view the topic's permissions.

. To remove a specific role assignment, select * allUsers* or * allAuthenticatedUsers*, and then click * Delete*.


* CLI Command* 


To remove access to * allUsers* and * allAuthenticatedUsers*, you need to first get the * Pub/Sub Topic's* existing IAM policy.
To retrieve the existing policy and copy it to a local file:


[source,shell]
----
{
 "gcloud pubsub topics get-iam-policy \\
   projects/PROJECT/topics/TOPIC \\
   --format json > topic_policy.json",
}
----
----
Replace * PROJECT* with the project ID where your Pub/Sub Topic is located.
Replace * TOPIC* with the Pub/Sub Topic ID.
Next, locate and remove the IAM bindings with either * allUsers* or * allAuthenticatedUsers* depending on your Checkov error.
After modifying the `topic_policy.json` file, update Pub/Sub Topic with the following command:


[source,shell]
----
----
{
 "gcloud pubsub topics set-iam-policy  \\
   projects/PROJECT/topics/TOPIC  \\
   topic_policy.json",
      "language": "shell"
}
----
Replace * PROJECT* with the project ID where your Pub/Sub Topic is located.
Replace * TOPIC* with the Pub/Sub Topic ID.
