== Google storage buckets are not encrypted


=== Description 


Google Storage Buckets is a Google service to store unstructured data that can be accessed by a key.
By default, Google will encrypt and decrypt the data to and from disk using a managed encryption key.
Google cloud storage services encrypts data on the server side, before it is written to disk, at no additional charge.
We recommend you use opt-in server-side-encryption wherever available.

=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console Use customer-managed encryption keys to configure your Cloud Storage service account with permission to use your Cloud KMS key, using the GCP Console, follow these steps:* 



. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to * Cloud Key Management Service Keys*.

. Click on the name of the key ring that contains the desired key.

. Select the key's checkbox.
+
The * Permissions* tab in the right window pane becomes available.

. In the * Add members* dialog, enter the email address of the Cloud Storage service account you are granting access to.

. In the * Select a role* drop down, select * Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter*.

. Click * Add*.


* CLI Command* 


Use the gsutil kms authorize command to give the service account associated with your bucket permission to encrypt and decrypt objects using your Cloud KMS key:
----
gsutil kms authorize
-p PROJECT_STORING_OBJECTS
-k KEY_RESOURCE
----
PROJECT_STORING_OBJECTS is the ID for the project containing the objects you want to encrypt or decrypt.
For example, my-pet-project.
KEY_RESOURCE is your Cloud KMS key resource.
For example, projects/my-pet-project/locations/us-east1/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key.

default_kms_key_name: A Cloud KMS key that will be used to encrypt objects inserted into this bucket, if no encryption method is specified.
You must pay attention to whether the crypto key is available in the location that this bucket is created in.
