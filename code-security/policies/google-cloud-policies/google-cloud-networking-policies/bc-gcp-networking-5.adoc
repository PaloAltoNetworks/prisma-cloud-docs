=== Description 


DNSSEC is a feature of the Domain Name System that authenticates responses to domain name lookups.
DNSSEC prevents attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests.
We recommend you ensure DNSSEC is enabled in: any public DNS zone, the top level domain registry, and in the local DNS resolvers.

[NOTE]
====
If *visibility* is set to *private*, then DNSSEC cannot be set, and this policy will pass.

You can enable DNSSEC for existing managed zones using the gcloud command line tool or the API: `gcloud dns managed-zones update EXAMPLE_ZONE --dnssec-state on`
