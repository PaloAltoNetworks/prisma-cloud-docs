=== Description

It is a best practice to ensure that your firewall ingress rules do not allow unrestricted access to your MySQL database, as it can increase the risk of unauthorized access or attacks on your database.
By restricting access to only specific IP addresses or ranges that you trust, you can help secure your database from potential threats.
Additionally, you can use tools like SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection between your database and client, which can help protect against interception of sensitive data.
