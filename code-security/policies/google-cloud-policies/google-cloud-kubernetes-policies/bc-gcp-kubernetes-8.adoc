=== Description 


Kubernetes uses client certificates, bearer tokens, an authenticating proxy, HTTP basic auth or OAuth app to authenticate API requests through authentication plugins.
As HTTP requests are made to the API server, plugins attempt to associate the following attributes with the request.
We recommend you ensure Kubernetes engine clusters are authenticated using OAuth method and not using client certificates as before after service latest upgrade.
