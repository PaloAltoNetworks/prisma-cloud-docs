=== Description 


Binary Authorization helps to protect supply-chain security by only allowing images with verifiable cryptographically signed metadata into the cluster.
Binary Authorization provides software supply-chain security for images that you deploy to GKE from Google Container Registry (GCR) or another container image registry.
Binary Authorization requires images to be signed by trusted authorities during the development process.
These signatures are then validated at deployment time.
By enforcing validation, you can gain tighter control over your container environment by ensuring only verified images are integrated into the build-and-release process.
