=== Description 


*PodSecurityPolicy* is an admission controller resource created to validate requests to create and update Pods on your cluster.
The *PodSecurityPolicy* defines a set of conditions that Pods must meet to be accepted by the cluster.
When a request to create or update a Pod does not meet the conditions in the PodSecurityPolicy, that request is rejected and an error is returned.
We recommend you enable PodSecurityPolicy Controller on Kubernetes engine clusters.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* Gcloud CLI To update the cluster to enable the PodSecurityPolicy Controller, use this command:* 


----
gcloud beta container clusters update cluster-name --enable-pod-security-policy
----

////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


First, be sure to have the *google-beta* provider setup in the *google_container_cluster*, then add the following block of code:


[source,go]
----
{
 "pod_security_policy_config {
    enabled = true
}",

}
----
