=== Description 


GKE enables users to select the operating system image that runs on each node.
You can also upgrade an existing cluster to use a different node image type.
GKE supports several OS images using the main container runtime directly integrated with Kubernetes, including *cos_containerd* and *ubuntu_containerd*.
We recommend you use *cos_containerd* and *ubuntu_containerd* to enhance node security.
*Containerd* is an industry-standard container runtime component that regularly updates security fixes and patches, providing better support, security, and stability than other images.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* Gcloud CLI* 


Use this following command to upgrade the cluster to use the `COS` image:
[,bash]
----
gcloud container clusters upgrade --image-type cos cluster-name
----
----
To upgrade a specific node-pool add the flag/argument `--node-pool node-pool-name`.
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


Add the *image_type* argument into the *node_config* bloc to your *google_container_cluster* or *google_container_node_pool* resource:

----
hcl
node_config {
image_type   = "COS"
}
----

It should force the cluster to recreate a node following the new configuration.
