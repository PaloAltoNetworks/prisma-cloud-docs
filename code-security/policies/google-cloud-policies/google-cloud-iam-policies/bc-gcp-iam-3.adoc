=== Description 


A service account is a special Google account that belongs to an application or a VM, instead of to an individual end-user.
Application/VM-Instance uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that end-users are not directly involved.
The service account resource has IAM policies attached to it to determine who can use the service account.
Users with IAM roles to update the *App Engine* and *Compute Engine* instances, such as *App Engine Deployer* and *Compute Instance Admin*, can run code as the service accounts used to run these instances.

This enables users to indirectly gain access to resources for which the service accounts have access.
Similarly, SSH access to a *Compute Engine* instance may also provide the ability to execute code as that instance/Service account.
Your organization may have multiple user-managed service accounts configured for a project.
Granting the** iam.serviceAccountUser *or **iam.serviceAserviceAccountTokenCreatorccountUser* roles to a user for a project gives the user access to all service accounts in the project, including service accounts created in the future.

This can result in elevation of privileges by using service accounts and corresponding *Compute Engine* instances.
To implement least privileges best practices, IAM users should not be assigned the *Service Account User* or *Service Account Token Creator* roles at the project level.
These roles should be assigned to a user for a specific service account, giving that user access to the service account.

The *Service Account User* allows a user to bind a service account to a long-running job service.
The *Service Account Token Creator* role allows a user to directly impersonate, or assert, the identity of a service account.
We recommend you assign the Service Account User (iam.serviceAccountUser) and Service Account Token Creator *iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator* roles to a user for a specific service account rather than assigning the role to a user at project level.
