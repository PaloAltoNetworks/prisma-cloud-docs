=== Description 


In GitLab, administrators can turn on the capability to require signed commits for a project.
When you enable required commit signing on a branch, contributors and bots can only push commits that have been signed and verified to the branch.
If a collaborator pushes an unsigned commit to a branch that requires commit signatures, the collaborator will need to rebase the commit to include a verified signature, then force push the rewritten commit to the branch.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*
