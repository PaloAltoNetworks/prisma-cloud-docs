=== Description 


In GitLab, administrators can require that all merge requests receive a specific number of approving reviews before someone merges the pull request into a protected branch.
It is also possible to require approving reviews from people with write permissions in the repository or from a designated code owner.
If a collaborator attempts to merge a pull request with pending or rejected reviews into the protected branch, the collaborator will receive an error message.
