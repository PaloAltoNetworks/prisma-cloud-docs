=== Description 


Using a vulnerable version of Apache Log4j library might enable attackers to exploit a Lookup mechanism that supports making requests using special syntax in a format string which can potentially lead to a risky code execution, data leakage and more.
Set your Application Gateway (WAF) to prevent executing such mechanism using the rule definition below.
