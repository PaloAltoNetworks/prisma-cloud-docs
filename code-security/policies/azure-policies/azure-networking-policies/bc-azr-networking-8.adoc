=== Description 


Periodically, new versions of HTTP are released to address security flaws and include additional functionality.
HTTP 2.0 has additional performance improvements on the head-of-line blocking problem of the older HTTP version, header compression, and prioritization of requests.
HTTP 2.0 no longer supports HTTP 1.1's chunked transfer encoding mechanism, as it provides its own more efficient mechanisms for data streaming.
We recommend you use the latest HTTP version for web apps and take advantage of any security fixes and new functionalities featured.
With each software installation you can determine if a given update meets your organization's requirements.
Organizations should verify the compatibility and support provided for any additional software, assessing the current version against the update revision being considered.

[NOTE]
====
Most modern browsers support the HTTP 2.0 protocol over TLS only, with non-encrypted traffic using HTTP 1.1. To ensure that client browsers connect to your app with HTTP/2, either by an App Service Certificate for your app's custom domain or by binding a third party certificate.
