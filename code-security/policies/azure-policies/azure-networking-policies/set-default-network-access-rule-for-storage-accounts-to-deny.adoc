=== Description 


Restricting default network access helps to provide an additional layer of security.
By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network.
To limit access to selected networks, the default action must be changed.
We recommend you configure storage accounts to *deny* access to traffic from all networks, including internet traffic.
At an appropriate time, access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure Virtual networks, allowing a secure network boundary for specific applications to be built.
Access can also be granted to public internet IP address ranges enabling connections from specific internet or on-premises clients.
When network rules are configured only applications from allowed networks can access a storage account.
When calling from an allowed network applications continue to require authorization, such as a valid access key or SAS token, to access the storage account.

=== Fix - Runtime


* Azure Portal To change the policy using the Azure Portal, follow these steps:* 



. Log in to the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com.

. Navigate to * Storage Accounts*.

. For each storage account:  a) Navigate to * Settings* menu.
+
b) Click * Firewalls and virtual networks*.
+
c) For selected networks, select * Allow access*.
+
d) Add rules to allow traffic from specific network.
+
e) To apply changes,click * Save*.


* CLI Command* 


To update * default-action* to * Deny*, use the following command:
----
az storage account update
--name & lt;StorageAccountName>
--resource-group &l t;resourceGroupName>
--default-action Deny

  account_tier              = "Standard"

*Suppression Advice* 

This can trigger incorrectly on _azurerm_storage_account_ when using correctly configured _azurerm_storage_account_network_rules_, if this occurs suppression is reasonable.
