=== Description 


AKS can be configured to use Azure Active Directory (AD) and Kubernetes Role-based Access Control (RBAC).
RBAC is designed to work on resources within your AKS clusters.
With RBAC, you can create a role definition that outlines the permissions to be applied.
A user or group is then assigned this role definition for a particular scope, which could be an individual resource, a resource group, or across the subscription.
We recommend you sign in to an AKS cluster using an Azure AD authentication token and configure Kubernetes RBAC.
This will limit access to cluster resources based a user's identity or group membership.
