=== Description 


The *Azure Queue Storage* service stores messages that may be read by any client with access to the storage account.
A queue may contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size when using version 2011-08-18 or newer.
*Storage Logging* takes place server-side recording details in the storage account for both successful and failed requests.
These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues.
*Storage Logging* log entries contain the following information about individual requests: timing information, for example start time, end-to-end latency, server latency, authentication details, concurrency information, and the size of request and response messages.
*Storage Analytics* logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service.
This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service.
Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.
*Storage Analytics* logging is not enabled by default for your storage account.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_storage_account
* *Arguments:* logging + hour_metrics + minute_metrics

{
 "resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
    name                     = "example"
    resource_group_name      = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
    location                 = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  }
}",

----
----
The *logging* field should be enough to enable logging.
As Terraform apply might fail, it is recommended to also configure the *hour_metrics* and *minute_metrics* fields.

{
 "+   hour_metrics {
        enabled               = true
        include_apis          = true
        version               = "1.0"
        retention_policy_days = 10
    }

+   minute_metrics {
        enabled               = true
        include_apis          = true
        version               = "1.0"
        retention_policy_days = 10
    }",

      "language": "go"
