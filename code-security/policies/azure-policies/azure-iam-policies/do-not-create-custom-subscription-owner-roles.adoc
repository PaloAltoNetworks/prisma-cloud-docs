=== Description 


Subscription ownership should not include permission to create custom owner roles.
The principle of least privilege should be followed and only necessary privileges be assigned instead of allowing full administrative access.
Classic subscription admin roles offer basic access management and include Account Administrator, Service Administrator, and Co-Administrators.
We recommend the minimum permissions necessary be given to subscription owner accounts initially.
Permissions can be added as needed by the account holder.
This ensures the account holder cannot perform actions which were not intended.

=== Fix - Runtime


* CLI Command* 


To provide a list of the role identified, use the following command: `az role definition list`
Check for entries with * assignableScope* of * /* or a * subscription*, and an action of * * * **.
To verify the usage and impact of removing the role identified, use the following command: `az role definition delete --name "rolename"`
