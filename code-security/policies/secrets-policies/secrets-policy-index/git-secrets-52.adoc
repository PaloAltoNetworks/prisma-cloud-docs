=== Description 


In LaunchDarkly, all REST API resources are authenticated with either personal or service access tokens, or session cookies.
Other authentication mechanisms are not supported.
You can manage personal access tokens on your Account settings page.
You can configure a personal access token to have the same permissions that you do, or more restrictive permissions.
Your personal tokens can never do more than you can in LaunchDarkly.
Use a personal token when you want to access the LaunchDarkly API for your temporary or personal use.
