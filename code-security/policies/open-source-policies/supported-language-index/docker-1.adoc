== Docker


=== Description 


The name "Docker" refers to several entities, including the following:
* An open source community project
* Tools from the open source project
* Docker Inc., the company that primarily supports the avoementioned project
* The set of tools formally supported by the company The Docker technology uses the Linux kernel and its features, like cgroups and namespaces, to segregate processes so they can run independently.
To achieve that goal, the Docker technology uses *containers*, which have the ability to run multiple processes and apps separately from one another, thus better utilizing your infrastructure while retaining the security you would have had with separate systems.
Container tools, including Docker, provide an image-based deployment model.
This enable easy sharing of an application or a set of services, including all of their dependencies across multiple environments.
Docker also automates deploying the application (or combined sets of processes that make up an app) inside this container environment.
The abovementioned tools are built on top of a Linux container, which makes Docker very user-friendly.
Docker is unique in the way it grants users an unprecedented access to apps, the ability to rapidly deploy apps, and control over versions and version distribution.

*Docker Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.* 


A Dockerfile is a text document containing all the commands a user can call via the CLI to assemble an image.
With Docker build, users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile.
