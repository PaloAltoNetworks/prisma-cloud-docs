=== Description 


Using absolute paths for the WORKDIR values in your Dockerfiles can help improve the security and reliability of your builds.
The WORKDIR value specifies the working directory for the build stage, and using an absolute path ensures that the correct directory is being used.
By using absolute paths for WORKDIR, you can help prevent potential issues such as using the wrong directory for a stage, which can lead to compatibility problems and potentially compromise the security of your containers.
It can also help ensure that your builds are consistent and reliable, as you can easily identify which directory is being used for each stage.

=== Fix - Buildtime
