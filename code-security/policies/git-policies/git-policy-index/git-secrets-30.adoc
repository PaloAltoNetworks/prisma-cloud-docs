=== Description 


Codecov is a tool that is used to measure the test coverage of your codebase.
It generally calculates the coverage ratio by examining which lines of code were executed while running the unit tests.
When linking a GitHub account to Codecov, the service can be restricted to public repositories only, or be allowed to access private repositories as well.
