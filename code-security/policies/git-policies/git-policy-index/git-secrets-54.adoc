=== Description 


New Relic monitoring solutions use API keys to authenticate and verify user identity.
The primary key is the user key (for working with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API).
These keys allow only approved people in your organization to report data to New Relic, access that data, and configure features.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*New *Relic*
You can view and manage most API keys from the API keys UI page, which is at one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher (from the account dropdown, click API keys).
