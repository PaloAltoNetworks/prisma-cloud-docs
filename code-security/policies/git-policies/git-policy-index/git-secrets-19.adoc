=== Description 


Password Entropy is a concept used to assign a numerical score to how unpredictable a password is or the likelihood of highly random data in a string of characters.
The policy calculates entropy levels using a Shannon Entropy calculator.
The entropy levels of keys are important, as the more or less information required to determine unknown key variables can alter how difficult it is to crack.
If a high-entropy string is detected, the string is printed to the screen.
This check scans the branch and evaluates the entropy for both the hexadecimal character set for every blob of text.
