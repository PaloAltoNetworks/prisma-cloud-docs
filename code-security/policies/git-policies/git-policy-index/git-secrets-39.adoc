=== Description 


To be authenticated to use the Dynatrace API, you need a valid access token or a valid personal access token.
Access to the API is fine-grained, meaning that you also need the proper scopes assigned to the token.
See the description of each request to find out which scopes are required to use it.
Dynatrace uses a unique token format consisting of three components separated by dots (.).
`dt0c01.ST2EY72KQINMH574WMNVI7YN.G3DFPBEJYMODIDAEX454M7YWBUVEFOWKPRVMWFASS64NFH52PX6BNDVFFM572RZM`
The part of a token composed of the prefix and public portion is a token identifier.
For example dt0c01.ST2EY72KQINMH574WMNVI7YN.
Token identifier can be safely displayed in the UI and can be used for logging purposes.
