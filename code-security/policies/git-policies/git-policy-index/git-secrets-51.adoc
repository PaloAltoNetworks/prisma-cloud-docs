=== Description 


In Jira, Personal access tokens (PATs) are a secure way to use scripts and integrate external applications with your Atlassian application.
If an external system is compromised, you simply revoke the token instead of changing the password and consequently changing it in all scripts and integrations.
Personal access tokens are a safe alternative to using username and password for authentication with various services.
