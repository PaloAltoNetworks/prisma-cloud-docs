=== Description 


RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries, a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.
You can create multiple API keys based on your requirements.
API keys have varying scopes that grant specific privileges.
Using API keys with the least amount of privilege makes your RubyGems.org account more secure by limiting the impact a compromised key may have.
