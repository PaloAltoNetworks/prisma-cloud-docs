=== Description 


PlanetScale offers a managed database platform that is designed for developers and developer workflows.
The PlanetScale CLI allows developers to create development branches, open deploy requests, and make non-blocking schema changes directly from a terminal.
PlanetScale provides the ability to create service tokens for your PlanetScale organization via the CLI or directly in the UI.
Service tokens are not recommended for connecting to production databases.
Instead, connect securely to your database using PlanetScale connection strings.
