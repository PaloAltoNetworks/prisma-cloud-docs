=== Description 


Capabilities permit certain named root actions without giving full root access and are considered a  fine-grained permissions model.
We recommend all capabilities should be dropped from a pod, with only those required added back.
There are a large number of capabilities, with CAP_SYS_ADMIN bounding most.
CAP_SYS_ADMIN is a highly privileged access level equivalent to root access and should generally be avoided.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:*  Container
* *Arguments:* securityContext:capabilities:add (Optional)  Add capabilities field allows granting certain privileges to a process.
