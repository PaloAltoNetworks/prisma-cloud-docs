=== Description 


NET_RAW capability allows the binary to use RAW and PACKET sockets as well as binding to any address for transparent proxying.
The _ep_ stands for "`effective`" (active) and "`permitted`" (allowed to be used).
With Docker as the container runtime NET_RAW capability is enabled by default and may be misused by malicious containers.
We recommend you define at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) to prevent containers with NET_RAW capability from launching.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* Container
* *Arguments:* securityContext:capabilities:drop (Optional)  Capabilites field allows granting certain privileges to a process without granting all the privileges of the root user.
when *drop* includes *ALL* or *NET_RAW*, the *NET_RAW* capability is disabled.
