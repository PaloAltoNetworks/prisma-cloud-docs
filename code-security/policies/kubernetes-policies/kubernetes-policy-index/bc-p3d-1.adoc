== Container with a RCE CVE has privileged access through PSP that can lead to a container escape
// A container with an RCE CVE has privileged access through PSP that can lead to a container escape


*Description* 


A container escape is when an attacker can gain access to the node where the container is hosted.
A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is a flaw in a package that allows for an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
If a container has an RCE CVE and that container was granted privilege through a Pod Security Policy, then attackers can execute code to break out of a container and gain access to the host node.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Multiple Services* 



. If available, patch the CVE by bumping the package.

. Explicitly disable privilege access.
+
This may cause breaks if a container was leverage privilege before.
