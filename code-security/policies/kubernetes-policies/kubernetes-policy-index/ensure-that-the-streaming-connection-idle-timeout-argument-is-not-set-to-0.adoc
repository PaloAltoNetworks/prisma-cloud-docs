=== Description 


Do not disable timeouts on streaming connections.
Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.
By default, --streaming-connection-idle-timeout is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment.
Setting this as appropriate would addition ally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.
