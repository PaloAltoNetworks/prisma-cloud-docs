=== Description 


The Terraform provider for Azure enables the capability to disable the Kubernetes dashboard on an AKS cluster.
This is achieved by providing the Kubernetes dashboard as an AKS add-on, similar to the Azure Monitor, for containers integration, AKS virtual nodes, and the HTTP application routing.
In mid-2019 Tesla was hacked where their kube-dashboard was exposed to the internet.
Hackers browsed around, found credentials, and deployed pods running bitcoin mining software.
We recommend you disable the kube-dashboard if it's not needed, to prevent the need to manage its individual access interface and limit it as an attack vector.

*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* Container
* *Arguments:*  labels:app / k8s-app - specifies the app label for the pod image - defines the image used by the container
