=== Description 


The Image Pull Policy of a container is set using the *imagePullPolicy*.
The *imagePullPolicy* and the tag of the image are triggered when the kubelet attempts to pull the specified image.
When the *imagePullPolicy* is set to *Always*, you ensure the latest version of the image is deployed every time the pod is started.
Avoid using the *:latest* tag when deploying containers in production, it is harder to track which version of the image is running and more difficult to roll back correctly.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 

*Resource*: Container
*Argument*: imagePullPolicy (Optional)

Defines for the kubelet when he should attempt to pull the specified image.
