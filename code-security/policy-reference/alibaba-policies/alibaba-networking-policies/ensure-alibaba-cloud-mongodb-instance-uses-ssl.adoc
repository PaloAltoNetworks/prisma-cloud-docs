=== Description

SSL helps protect your data from unauthorized access or tampering by encrypting the data as it is transmitted between the MongoDB instance and the client.
By enabling SSL, you can help ensure that only authorized users with the correct keys can access and decrypt the data, and that the data is protected while in transit.
