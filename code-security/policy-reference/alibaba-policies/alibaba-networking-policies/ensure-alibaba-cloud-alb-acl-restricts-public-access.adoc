=== Description 

Alibaba Cloud ALB ACL refers to Access Control List feature of the Alibaba Cloud Server Load Balancer (SLB) product called Application Load Balancer (ALB). Through ALB ACL, you can prevent public access to your backend servers by configuring various settings such as IP addresses, domain names, HTTP methods, or HTTP header fields. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

To restrict public access to your servers through ALB ACL, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.


[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_alb_acl_entry_attachment" "phew" {
  acl_id      = alicloud_alb_acl.fail.id
  entry       = "10.0.0.0/16"
  description = var.name
}
