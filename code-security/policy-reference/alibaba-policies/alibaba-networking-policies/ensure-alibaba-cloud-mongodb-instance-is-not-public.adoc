=== Description 
If an Alibaba Cloud MongoDB instance is configured to be publicly accessible, it can be accessed by anyone on the internet. This could lead to several security risks, including unauthorized access and data theft. To restrict access to your Alibaba Cloud MongoDB instance, disable public network access and allow access only from a private endpoint.


// === Fix - Runtime


=== Fix - Buildtime

To restrict public access to an Alibaba Cloud MongoDB instance, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.


*Terraform*
