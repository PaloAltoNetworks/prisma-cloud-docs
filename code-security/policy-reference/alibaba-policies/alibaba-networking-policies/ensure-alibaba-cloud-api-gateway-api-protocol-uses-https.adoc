=== Description 


To prevent unauthorized access or tampering with data being transferred, use a secure Gateway API protocol such as HTTPS, which encrypts communication between clients and servers. This helps to mitigate the risk of potential security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, in which an attacker intercepts and modifies the communication between the API and its clients.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To configure HTTPS as the Alibaba Cloud API Gateway API protocol, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.




[source,go]

resource "alicloud_api_gateway_api" "pass" {
