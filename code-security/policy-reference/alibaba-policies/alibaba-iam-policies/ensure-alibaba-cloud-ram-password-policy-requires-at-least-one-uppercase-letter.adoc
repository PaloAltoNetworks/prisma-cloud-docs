=== Description 




Including a uppercase character in a password is important as it adds complexity and makes it harder for attackers to guess or crack the password using automated tools. Using only lowercase or numeric characters in a password makes it easier for attackers to perform a brute-force attack, where they try all possible combinations until they find the correct one. By including uppercase characters, the number of possible combinations increases, making it more challenging for attackers to guess or crack the password. To mitigate this risk and prevent unauthorized access to an account, enforce a policy requiring passwords to include an uppercase character for Alibaba Cloud RAM accounts (account). This policy identifies accounts that do not include an uppercase character in their password policy.

----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "pass" {
  minimum_password_length      = 14
  require_lowercase_characters = false
  require_uppercase_characters = true
  require_numbers              = false
  require_symbols              = true
  hard_expiry                  = true
  max_password_age             = 14
