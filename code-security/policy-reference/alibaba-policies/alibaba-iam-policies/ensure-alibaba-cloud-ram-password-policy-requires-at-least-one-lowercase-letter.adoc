=== Description 


Including a lowercase character in a password is important as it adds complexity and makes it harder for attackers to guess or crack the password using automated tools. Using only uppercase or numeric characters in a password makes it easier for attackers to perform a brute-force attack, where they try all possible combinations until they find the correct one. By including lowercase characters, the number of possible combinations increases, making it more challenging for attackers to guess or crack the password. To mitigate this risk and prevent unauthorized access to an account, enforce a policy requiring passwords to include a lowercase character for Alibaba Cloud RAM accounts (account). This policy identifies accounts that do not include a lowercase character in their password policy.

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "pass" {
  minimum_password_length      = 14
  require_lowercase_characters = true
  require_uppercase_characters = false
  require_numbers              = false
  require_symbols              = false
  hard_expiry                  = true
  max_password_age             = 14
  password_reuse_prevention    = 5
  max_login_attempts           = 3
