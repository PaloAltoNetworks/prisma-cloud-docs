=== Description 


By default, the maximum login attempts for an Alibaba Cloud RAM account (account) is set to 5. After 5 failed login attempts, the account is locked. By lowering the number of allowed login attempts, the risk of unauthorized access to the account is decreased, as the chances of guessing the correct login credentials are reduced. This policy identifies accounts which have maximum login attempts set to 5 or more.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To identify accounts which allow more that 5 login, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.



[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "pass" {
  minimum_password_length      = 9
  require_lowercase_characters = false
  require_uppercase_characters = false
  require_numbers              = false
  require_symbols              = false
  hard_expiry                  = true
  max_password_age             = 12
  password_reuse_prevention    = 5
  max_login_attempts           = 3
}
