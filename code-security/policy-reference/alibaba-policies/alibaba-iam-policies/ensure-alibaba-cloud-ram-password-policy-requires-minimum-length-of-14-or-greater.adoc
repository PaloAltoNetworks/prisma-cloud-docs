=== Description 


Requiring passwords to include a minimum of 14 characters is important as it adds complexity and makes it harder for attackers to guess or crack the password using automated tools. To mitigate this risk and prevent unauthorized access to an account, enforce a policy requiring passwords to include a minimum of 14 characters for Alibaba Cloud RAM accounts (account). This policy identifies accounts that do not include a minimum of 14 characters in their password policy.

This policy identifies Alibaba Cloud accounts that do not have a minimum of 14 characters in the password policy.
As a security best practice, configure a strong password policy for secure access to the Alibaba Cloud console.
