=== Description 


As a best practice, it is important to change passwords after 90 days as a security measure to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to an account, as it reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to use stolen or compromised passwords. This policy identifies Alibaba Cloud RAM accounts (account)that do not have password expiration set to 90 days or more.
