=== Description 


By default, the password policy for Alibaba Cloud RAM accounts (account) does not enforce restrictions on password reuse. If users reuse passwords, they become more vulnerable to password-related attacks, as it allows attackers to guess or recover an old password. To mitigate this risk and prevent unauthorized access to an account, enforce restrictions on password reuse to make it harder for attackers to guess or recover an old password. This policy identifies accounts that do not enforce restrictions on password reuse.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To identify accounts that do not enforce restrictions on password reuse, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.


[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_ram_account_password_policy" "pass" {
  minimum_password_length      = 14
  require_lowercase_characters = false
  require_uppercase_characters = false
  require_numbers              = false
  require_symbols              = true
  hard_expiry                  = true
  max_password_age             = 14
  password_reuse_prevention    = 24
  max_login_attempts           = 3
}
