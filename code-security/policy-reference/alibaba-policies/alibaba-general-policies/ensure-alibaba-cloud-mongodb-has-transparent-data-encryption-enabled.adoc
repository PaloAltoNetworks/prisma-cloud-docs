=== Description

Transparent data encryption for your Alibaba Cloud MongoDB helps protect your data from unauthorized access or tampering by encrypting the data as it is written to disk and decrypting it when it is accessed.
By enabling transparent data encryption, you can help ensure that only authorized users with the correct keys can access and decrypt the data, and that the data is protected while in storage.
