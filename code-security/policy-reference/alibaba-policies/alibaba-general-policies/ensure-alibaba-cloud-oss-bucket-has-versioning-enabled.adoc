=== Description


Disabling versioning for an Alibaba Cloud OSS bucket can result in potential data loss, compliance issues, accidental deletion or modification, and a lack of ability to track changes. To prevent this risk enable bucket versioning to automatically archive all versions of an object, including writes and deletes. This allows you to recover previous versions of an object or restore an accidentally deleted object.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

Enable OSS bucket versioning by adding the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.



[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "pass" {
  bucket = "bucket-123-versioning"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
