=== Description 


Public database instances are vulnerable, as attackers can use a variety of techniques to gain unauthorized access to public databases, such as SQL injection attacks, brute-force attacks, or exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the database software. To prevent this risk, make the database instance private by restricting access to only authorized users.

=== Fix - Buildtime
