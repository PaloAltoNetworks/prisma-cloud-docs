=== Description 


The transfer acceleration function in Object Storage Service (OSS) enables quick access and transfer of stored objects for global users. However, it may result in higher data transfer costs since transfer acceleration incurs rates higher than those of standard transfer rates. To prevent this risk, disable transfer acceleration.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

Disable transfer acceleration by adding the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.


[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "pass" {
  bucket = "bucket_name"

  transfer_acceleration {
    enabled = true
  }
}
----
