=== Description 


Publicly accessible Object Storage Service (OSS) buckets are vulnerable, as attackers can gain unauthorized access to highly sensitive enterprise data which if left open to the public may result in sensitive data leaks. To prevent this risk ensure that the OSS bucket is made private by restricting access to authorized users only.

////
=== Fix - Runtime
Alibaba Cloud Portal
. Log in to Alibaba Cloud Portal

. Go to Object Storage Service

. In the left-side navigation pane, click on the reported bucket

. In the 'Basic Settings' tab, In the 'Access Control List (ACL)' Section, Click on 'Configure'

. For 'Bucket ACL' field, Choose 'Private' option

. Click on 'Save'
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


Make the OSS bucket private by adding the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.


[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_oss_bucket" "good-bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket-1732-acl"
  acl    = "private"
}
