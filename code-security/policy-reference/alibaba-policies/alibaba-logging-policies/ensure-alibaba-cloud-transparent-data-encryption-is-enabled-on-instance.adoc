=== Description 


Alibaba Cloud Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is a security feature that encrypts data at the storage level, which means that data is encrypted while it is written to the disk and decrypted when it is read. Activating TDE on an instance helps to protect the data stored on the instance from unauthorized access or exposure.
TDE also helps to meet compliance requirements that mandate data to be encrypted at rest.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To enable TDE, add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.



[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_db_instance" "pass" {
  engine              = "MySQL"
  engine_version      = "5.6"
  instance_type   = "rds.mysql.t1.small"
  instance_storage = "10"
  tde_status          = "Enabled"
  parameters = [{
    name  = "innodb_large_prefix"
    value = "ON"
    }, {
    name  = "connect_timeout"
    value = "50"
  }]
}
