=== Description 


By enabling Action Trail logging for all regions, you can track and monitor all activity in your Alibaba Cloud account, including the source IP address, the user or service that made the request, and the response status, regardless of where the activity occurs.
This can help to identify potential security issues or unauthorized access, and can also be useful for auditing purposes.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To enable Cloud ActionTrail Logging Services for all regions. add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.




[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_actiontrail_trail" "pass" {
  trail_name         = "action-trail"
  oss_write_role_arn = "acs:ram::1182725xxxxxxxxxxx"
  oss_bucket_name    = "bucket_name"
  event_rw           = "All"
  trail_region       = "All"
}
