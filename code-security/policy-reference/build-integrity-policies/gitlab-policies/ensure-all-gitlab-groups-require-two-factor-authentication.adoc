=== Description


In GitLab, 2FA provides an additional level of security to user accounts.
When enabled, users are prompted for a code generated by an application in addition to supplying their username and password to sign in.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*GitLab Enable 2FA for all users:*



. On the top bar, select *Menu > Admin*.

. On the left sidebar, select *Settings > General* (/admin/application_settings/general).

. Expand the *Sign-in restrictions* section, where you can configure both.


Enforce 2FA only for certain groups:

. Go to the group's *Settings > General* page.

. Expand the *Permissions and group features* section.

. Select the *Require all users* in this group to set up two-factor authentication option.
