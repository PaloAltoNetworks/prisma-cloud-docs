=== Description 


Organization owners and admins can enforce SAML SSO so that all organization members must authenticate via an identity provider (IdP).
You can also enforce SAML SSO for your organization.
When you enforce SAML SSO, all members of the organization must authenticate through your IdP to access the organization's resources.
Enforcement removes any members and administrators who have not authenticated via your IdP from the organization.
GitHub sends an email notification to each removed user.
