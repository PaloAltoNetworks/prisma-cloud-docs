=== Description 


This check is designed to examine AWS IAM policy documents to ensure that GitHub Actions OIDC trust policies only allow actions from a specific, known organization. It checks whether a GitHub Actions based OIDC IAM assume role policy doesn't contain a condition to filter access to only a specific GitHub org/repo, allowing every GitHub account to assume the role.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource: aws_iam_policy_document*
* *Argument: principals, condition* 

If you are using federated access for GitHub Actions, add a `condition` with a specific organization.

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "fail1" {
  version = "2012-10-17"

  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

      "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
    ]
    principals {
      identifiers = ["arn:aws:iam::123456123456:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"]
      type        = "Federated"
    }
    condition {
      test     = "StringEquals"
      values   = ["sts.amazonaws.com"]
      variable = "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud"
    }

+   # Add this block with your organization name in the values
+   condition {
+     test     = "StringEquals"
+     values   = ["repo:myOrg/*"]
