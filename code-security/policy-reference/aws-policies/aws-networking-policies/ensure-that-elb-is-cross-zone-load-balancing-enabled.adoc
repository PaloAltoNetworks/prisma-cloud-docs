=== Description 


Cross-zone load balancing reduces the need to maintain equivalent numbers of instances in each enabled Availability Zone, and improves your application's ability to handle the loss of one or more instances.
This would also guarantee better fault tolerance and more consistent traffic flow.
If one of the availability zones registered with the ELB fails (as result of network outage or power loss), the load balancer with the Cross-Zone Load Balancing activated would act as a traffic guard, stopping any request being sent to the unhealthy zone and routing it to the other zones.
