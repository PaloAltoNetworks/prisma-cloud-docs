=== Description 


Network Access Control List (NACL) is stateless and provides filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources.
We recommend that NACLs do not allow unrestricted ingress access to port 21.
Removing unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as FTP, reduces a server's exposure to risk.
