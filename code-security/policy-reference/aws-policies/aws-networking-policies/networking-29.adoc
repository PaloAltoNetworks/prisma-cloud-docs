=== Description 


An internet-facing AWS ELB/ALB is a public resource on your network that is completely exposed to the internet.
It has a publicly resolvable DNS name, that can accept HTTP(S) requests from clients over the Internet.
External actors gaining knowledge to this information can potentially attempt to access the EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer.
When an AWS ALB has no HTTPS listeners, front-end connections between the web clients and the load balancer could become targeted by man-in-the-middle attacks and traffic interception techniques.
