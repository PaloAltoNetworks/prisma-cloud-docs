=== Description 


Descriptions can be up to 255 characters long and can be set and viewed from the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and the AWS APIs.
We recommend you add descriptive text to each of your Security Group Rules clarifying each rule's goals, this helps prevent developer errors.
