=== Description 


It is recommended to enable create_before_destroy argument inside the resource lifecycle configuration block to avoid a possible outage when the certificate needs to be recreated during an update.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*CloudFormation* 


CloudFormation creates a new certificate first and then will delete the old one automatically.


*Terraform*
