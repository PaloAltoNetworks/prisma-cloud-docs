=== Description 


Enabling event notifications for your AWS CloudFormation stacks can help you to monitor and track changes to your stacks.
When event notifications are enabled, CloudFormation will send a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic each time a stack event occurs.
By doing so, you will improve your visibility and automation processes (if desired).
