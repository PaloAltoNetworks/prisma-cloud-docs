=== Description 


Container Insights can be used to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from containerized applications and microservices.
They can also be extended to collect metrics at the cluster, task, and service levels.
Using Container Insights allows you to monitor, troubleshoot, and set alarms for all your Amazon ECS resources.
It provides a simple to use native and fully managed service for managing ECS issues.
We recommend that for existing clusters you use the AWS CLI;
and for new clusters, you use either the Amazon ECS console, or the AWS CLI.

=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 



. Log in to the AWS Management Console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/].

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/ [Amazon ECS console].

. In the navigation pane, choose * Account Settings*.

. To enable the Container Insights default opt-in, check the box at the bottom of the page.


* CLI Command* 


You can use the AWS CLI to set account-level permission to enable Container Insights for any new Amazon ECS clusters created in your account.
To do so, enter the following command.
