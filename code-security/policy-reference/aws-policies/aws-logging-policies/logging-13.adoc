=== Description 


Enabling CloudWatch retention establishes how long log events are kept in AWS CloudWatch Logs.
Retention settings are assigned to CloudWatch log groups and the retention period assigned to a log group is applied to their log streams.
Any data older than the current retention setting is deleted automatically.
You can change the log retention for each log group at any time.
Log data is stored in CloudWatch Logs indefinitely by default, l.
This may incur high unexpected costs, especially when combined with other forms of logging.
We recommend you configure how long to store log data for in a log group to balance cost with compliance retention requirements.
