=== Description 


Enabling enhanced monitoring for Amazon RDS instances can provide you with additional visibility into the performance and health of your database instances.
With enhanced monitoring, you can retrieve real-time performance metrics for your RDS instances at intervals of 1 second, rather than the standard interval of 60 seconds.
This can be particularly useful for troubleshooting performance issues, identifying trends in resource utilization, and detecting potential issues before they become problems.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_db_instance
* *Arguments:* monitoring_interval


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_db_instance" "default" {
  allocated_storage    = 10
  ...
+ monitoring_interval  = 5
  }
