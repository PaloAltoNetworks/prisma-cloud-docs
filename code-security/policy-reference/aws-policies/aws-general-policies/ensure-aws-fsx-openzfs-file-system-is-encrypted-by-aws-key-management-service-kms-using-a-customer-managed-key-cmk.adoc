=== Description 


This policy identifies  FSX openzfs file systems which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your  FSX openzfs file system data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.
