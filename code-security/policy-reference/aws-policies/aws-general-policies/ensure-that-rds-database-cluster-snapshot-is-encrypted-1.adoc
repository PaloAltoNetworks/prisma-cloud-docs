=== Description 


Encrypting your RDS database cluster snapshots helps protect your data from unauthorized access or tampering.
That way, you can ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the contents of your cluster snapshots.
Such action can help protect against external threats such as hackers or malware, as well as internal threats such as accidental or unauthorized access.
