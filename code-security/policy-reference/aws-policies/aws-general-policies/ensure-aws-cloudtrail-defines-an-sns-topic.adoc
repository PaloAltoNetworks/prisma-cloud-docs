=== Description

AWS CloudTrail is a service that records API activity in your AWS account, including all API calls made to AWS services and the associated responses.
By sending CloudTrail log events to an SNS topic, you can set up notifications that will be sent to you whenever certain types of activity occur in your AWS environment.
In addition, sending CloudTrail log events to an SNS topic also allows you to store the log events in a central location, such as an Amazon S3 bucket, for analysis and reporting purposes.
This can be useful for compliance, auditing, and other types of monitoring.
