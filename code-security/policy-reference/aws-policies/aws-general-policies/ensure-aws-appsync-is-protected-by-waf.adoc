=== Description

Ensuring that your AWS AppSync API is protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF) can help to improve the security of your API by protecting against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by inspecting incoming requests and blocking those that contain malicious payloads.
It can also help to prevent DDoS attacks by allowing you to set rate-based rules that limit the number of requests that an IP address can send to your API within a specified time period.
