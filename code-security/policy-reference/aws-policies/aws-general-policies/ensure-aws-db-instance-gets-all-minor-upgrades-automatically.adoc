=== Description 


When Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) supports a new version of a database engine, you can upgrade your DB instances to the new version.
There are two kinds of upgrades: major version upgrades and minor version upgrades.
Minor upgrades helps maintain a secure and stable RDS with minimal impact on the application.
For this reason, we recommend that your automatic minor upgrade is enabled.
Minor version upgrades only occur automatically if a minor upgrade replaces an unsafe version, such as a minor upgrade that contains bug fixes for a previous version.

=== Fix - Runtime

. Go to the AWS console https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/ [RDS dashboard].

. In the navigation pane, choose Instances.

. Select the database instance you wish to configure.

. From the Instance actions menu, select Modify.

. Under the Maintenance* section, choose Yes for Auto minor version upgrade.

. Select Continue and then Modify DB Instance.
