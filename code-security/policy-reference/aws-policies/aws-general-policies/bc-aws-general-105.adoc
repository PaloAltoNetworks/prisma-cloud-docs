=== Description 


This policy identifies the AWS Kinesis streams which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Master Keys managed by Customer.
It is a best practice to use customer managed Master Keys to encrypt your Amazon Kinesis streams data.
It gives you full control over the encrypted data.
