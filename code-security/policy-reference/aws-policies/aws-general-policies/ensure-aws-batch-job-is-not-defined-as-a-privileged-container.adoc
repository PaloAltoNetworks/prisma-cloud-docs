=== Description

By defining your AWS Batch job as a privileged container, you can ensure that it has the necessary privileges to access system devices, such as GPUs or hardware accelerators, modify system-level configuration files, and more.
That said, making a job overly permissive might increase the potential security risks, as the job will have more access to sensitive system resources

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*
