=== Description 


S3 versioning is a managed data backup and recovery service provided by AWS.
When enabled it allows users to retrieve and restore previous versions of their buckets.
S3 versioning can be used for data protection and retention scenarios such as recovering objects that have been accidentally/intentionally deleted or overwritten.
