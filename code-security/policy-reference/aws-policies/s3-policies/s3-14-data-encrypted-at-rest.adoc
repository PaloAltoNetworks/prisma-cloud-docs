=== Description 


SSE helps prevent unauthorized access to S3 buckets.
Encrypting and decrypting data at the S3 bucket level is transparent to users when accessing data.

////
=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/ [Amazon S3 console].

. Select the name of the bucket that you want from the _Bucket name list_.

. Select * Properties*.

. Select * Default encryption*.

. To use keys that are managed by Amazon S3 for default encryption, select * AES-256*, then select * Save*.

. If you want to use CMKs that are stored in AWS KMS for default encryption, follow these steps:
+

.. Select * AWS-KMS*.
+

.. Select a customer-managed AWS KMS CMK that you have created, using one of these methods:  a) In the list that appears, select the * AWS KMS CMK*.
+
b) In the list that appears, select * Custom KMS ARN*, and then enter the * Amazon Resource Name of the AWS KMS CMK*.
+

.. Click * Save*.
+
The steps above will encrypt all new files going forward.
+
To encrypt all existing files, follow the steps below.
+
Note that this will appear as an object modification, which will be logged if access logging is configured, and will count as a bucket write operation for billing purposes.
+
Be mindful of applying these steps on large buckets.

. Navigate to the bucket * Overview* tab.

. Select objects to encrypt.

. From the * Actions* dropdown, select * Change encryption*.

. Select the desired encryption method, then click * Save*.

. The progress bar for the background job displays at the bottom of the screen.


* CLI Command* 


To set encryption at the bucket level for all new objects, use the following command:


[source,shell]
----
{
 "aws s3api put-bucket-encryption 
--bucket awsexamplebucket 
--server-side-encryption-configuration 
'{"Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"}}]}'",
}
----

The command above will not encrypt existing objects.
To do so, you must re-add each file with encryption.
You can copy a single object back to itself encrypted with SSE-S3 (server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys), using the following S3 Encrypt command:


[source,shell]
----
{
 "aws s3 cp s3://awsexamplebucket/myfile s3://awsexamplebucket/myfile --sse AES256",
       
}
----
////

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket
* *Arguments:* server_side_encryption_configuration


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  ...
+ server_side_encryption_configuration {
+   rule {
+       apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
+       sse_algorithm = "AES256"
+       }
+   }
+   }
}
----


*CloudFormation* 


* *Resource:* AWS::S3::Bucket
* *Arguments:* Properites.BucketEncryption


[source,yaml]
----
Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
        ...
+       BucketEncryption:
+           ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
+               - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
+                   SSEAlgorithm: AES256
