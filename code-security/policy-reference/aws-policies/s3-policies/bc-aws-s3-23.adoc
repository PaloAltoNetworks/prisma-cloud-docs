=== Description 


The Principal element specifies the user, account, service, or other entity that is allowed or denied access to a resource.
In Amazon S3, a Principal is the account or user who is allowed access to the actions and resources in the statement.
When added to a bucket policy, the principal is the user, account, service, or other entity that is the recipient of this permission.
When you set the wildcard ("_") as the Principal value you essentially grant permission to everyone.
This is referred to as anonymous access.
The following statements are all considered Anonymous Permissions.

[source,shell]
----
## Example 1
"Principal":"*"

## Example 2
"Principal":{"AWS":"*"}

## Example 2
"Principal":{"AWS":["*", ...]}
----


When you grant anonymous access, anyone in the world can access your bucket.
It is highly recommend to *never* grant any kind of anonymous write access to your S3 bucket.

=== Fix - Runtime


* AWS Console* 


To change the policy using the AWS Console, follow these steps:

. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/ [Amazon S3 console].

. Select the * Permissions* tab, then select * Bucket Policy*.

. Remove policies for s3:List* actions for principals '*'.
+
If necessary, modify the policy instead, to limit the access to specific principals.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*
