=== Description 


If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Delete: enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header to delete an object.
Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS.
Configuring a bucket to enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) Delete requires additional authentication for either of the following operations:  (1) Change the versioning state of your bucket  (2) Permanently delete an object version.
We recommend you configure S3 bucket with MFA Delete: enabled.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_s3_bucket
* *Argument:* mfa_delete - (Optional) Enable MFA delete for either Change the versioning state of your bucket or Permanently delete an object version.

Default is false.
This cannot be used to toggle this setting but is available to allow managed buckets to reflect the state in AWS


[source,go]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  +  mfa_delete = true
  }
}
