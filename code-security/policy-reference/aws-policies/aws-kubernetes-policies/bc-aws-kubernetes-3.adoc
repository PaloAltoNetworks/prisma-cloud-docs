=== Description 


Secrets in Kubernetes enables managing sensitive information such as passwords and API keys using Kubernetes-native APIs.
When creating a secret resource the Kubernetes API server stores it in *etcd* in a base64 encoded form.
For example, using kubectl create secret, EKS can encrypt etcd volumes at disk-level using AWS-managed encryption keys.
AWS encourages using envelope encryption to encrypt a key with another key.
The motivation is security best practice.
Applications store sensitive data as part of a defense in depth security strategy.
A master key is stored in AWS KMS that is then utilized for data key generation in the Kubernetes API server.
It is also used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data stored in Kubernetes secrets.
