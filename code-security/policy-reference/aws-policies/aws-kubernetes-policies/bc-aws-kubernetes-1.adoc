=== Description 


Amazon EKS creates an endpoint for any managed Kubernetes API server to communicate with the cluster.
By default, this API server endpoint is public to the internet.
Access to it should be regulated using AWS IAM and native Kubernetes RBAC.
We recommend that your Kubernetes API server remains private so that all communication between worker nodes and APIs stays within your VPC.
If public access is needed, at a minimum, restrict the IP addresses that can access your API server from the internet to reduce the potential attack surface.
Ensure your Amazon EKS public endpoint is not accessible to 0.0.0.0/0.

=== Fix - Runtime


* Amazon Console* 



. Login to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/ [Amazon EKS console].

. To display your cluster information, select the cluster's name.

. Navigate to * Networking*, select * Update*.

. Select * Private Access** or Public Access*.
+
* Private access*.
+
Select whether to enable or disable private access for your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint.
+
If you enable private access, Kubernetes API requests that originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private VPC endpoint.
+
You must enable private access to disable public access.
+
* Public access*.
+
Select whether to enable or disable public access for your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint.
+
If you disable public access, your cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive requests from within the cluster VPC.

. Click * Advanced Settings*.

. To enter a CIDR block or add additional blocks, select * Add Source*.
+
If you specify no blocks, the public API server endpoint receives requests from all (0.0.0.0/0) IP addresses.

. To finish, click * Update*.
