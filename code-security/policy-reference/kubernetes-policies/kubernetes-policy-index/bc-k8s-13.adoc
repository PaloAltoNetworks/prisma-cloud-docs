=== Description 


You can add a *:fixed* tag to a container image, making it easier to determine what it contains, for example to specify the version.
Container image tags and digests are used to refer to a specific version or instance of a container image.
We recommend you avoid using the *:latest* and *:blank* tags when deploying containers in production as it is harder to track which version of the image is running, and more difficult to roll back properly.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes*

*Resource*: Container 
*Argument*: image:tag (Optional)

Defines the image version by a specific number or by using *latest*.
