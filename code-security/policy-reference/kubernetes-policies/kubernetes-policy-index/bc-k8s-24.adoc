=== Description 


Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime.
By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities.
With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers.
Ideally, all containers should drop this capability.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*
