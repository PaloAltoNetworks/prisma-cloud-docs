=== Description 


Limit the rate at which the API server accepts requests.
Using EventRateLimit admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice.

A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable.
This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall.

Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept.

NOTE: This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release.
