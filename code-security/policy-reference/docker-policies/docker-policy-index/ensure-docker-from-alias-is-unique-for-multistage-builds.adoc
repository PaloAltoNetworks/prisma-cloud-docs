=== Description

Using unique FROM aliases in your Docker multistage builds can help improve the security and reliability of your builds.
The FROM alias is used to specify the base image for a build stage, and using a unique alias for each stage can help prevent confusion and ensure that the correct image is being used.

=== Fix - Buildtime
