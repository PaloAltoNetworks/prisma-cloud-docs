=== Description 


By exposing port 22,  you may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network.
As a best practice, restrict SSH solely to known static IP addresses.
Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.

=== Fix - Buildtime
