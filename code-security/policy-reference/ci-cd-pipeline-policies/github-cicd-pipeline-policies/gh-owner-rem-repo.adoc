=== Description 

**CODEOWNERS** files can be used to define the entity responsible for the code. A branch protection rule can be set to enforce review and approval by code owners on code changes. Removing the CODEOWNERS file renders the branch protection rule, which requires ownersâ€™ approval to code changes, redundant. A malicious attacker with access to the repository will be able to make changes without the owner's approval, potentially allowing code to reach production.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

* Verify the reason for removing the CODEOWNERS file. 
* Consider restoring the deleted CODEOWNERS file.
