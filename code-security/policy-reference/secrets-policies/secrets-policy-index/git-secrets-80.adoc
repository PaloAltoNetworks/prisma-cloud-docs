=== Description


Entropy checks help detect unstructured secrets by measuring the entropy level of a single string. Entropy is a concept used to assign a numerical score to how unpredictable a password is or the likelihood of highly random data in a string of characters. Strings with a high entropy score are flagged as suspected secrets.
