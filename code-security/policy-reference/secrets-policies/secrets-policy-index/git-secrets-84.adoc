=== Description 


The OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol, which enables users to grant third-party applications access to their PayPal accounts without sharing their login credentials. When a user grants permission to a third-party application, PayPal issues an access token and a refresh token, which the application can use to access the user's PayPal account on their behalf.
