=== Description 


Terraform Cloud supports three distinct types of API tokens with varying levels of access: user, team, and organization.
API tokens are displayed only once when they are created, and are obfuscated thereafter.
If the token is lost, it must be regenerated.


*User API Tokens User tokens are the most flexible token type because they inherit permissions from the user they are associated with.* 




*Team API Tokens Team API tokens allow access to the workspaces that the team has access to, without being tied to any specific user.* 


Each team can have one valid API token at a time, and any member of a team can generate or revoke that team's token.
When a token is regenerated, the previous token immediately becomes invalid.


*Organization API Tokens Organization API tokens allow access to the organization-level settings and resources, without being tied to any specific team or user.* 


To manage the API token for an organization, go to Organization settings > API Token and use the controls under the "Organization Tokens" header.
Each organization can have one valid API token at a time.
Only organization owners can generate or revoke an organization's token.
