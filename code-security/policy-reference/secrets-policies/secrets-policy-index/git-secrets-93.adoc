=== Description

A PubNub Publish Key is used to send or publish messages to the PubNub Data Stream Network (DSN). Along with the Subscribe Key, it forms a unique pair that identifies your specific application and channel for transmitting and receiving real-time messages. The Publish Key is crucial for the delivery of messages across your PubNub-enabled applications and should be kept secure to prevent unauthorized usage.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*PubNub*

There isn't a straightforward way to revoke or regenerate a PubNub Publish Key. If you suspect your key has been compromised, the typical approach would be to create a new set of keys (Publish Key, Subscribe Key) in the PubNub Admin Dashboard and replace the compromised keys in your application code. In more extreme cases, you might need to create a new PubNub project and migrate your application to the new project with a fresh set of keys. Always consult the latest PubNub documentation for current practices.
