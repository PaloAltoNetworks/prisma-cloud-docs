=== Description 


Using the Cloudflare API, requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions they have.
An API Token can be created to grant access to the API to perform actions.
See creating an API Token for more on this.
When using the Cloudflare API, developers need to authenticate API requests.
