=== Description


Braintree Authentication ID is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate requests made to the Braintree payment gateway. Braintree is a payment processing platform that enables businesses to accept and process payments from customers.

The Braintree Authentication ID is used in combination with other API credentials to authorize requests to the Braintree gateway, such as creating transactions, managing customers, and performing other payment-related tasks. It is important to keep your API credentials secure and not to share them with anyone who does not need access to them.
