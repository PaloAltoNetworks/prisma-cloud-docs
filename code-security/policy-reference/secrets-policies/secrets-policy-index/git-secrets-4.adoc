=== Description 


Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.
Leaked usernames and password can be used by attackers to attempt to authenticate to existing accounts and steal information they hold.
