=== Description

A SendGrid Key, or API Key, is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests to the SendGrid API. It allows you to send emails, retrieve information about your account, manage contacts, and more. The API Key must be included in the header of any request made to the SendGrid API. It's crucial to keep this key secure, as anyone with access to it can use your SendGrid account.
