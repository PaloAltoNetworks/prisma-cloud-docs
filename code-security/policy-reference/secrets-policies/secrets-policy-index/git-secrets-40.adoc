=== Description 


Elastic Email is a mail relay service.
That is, instead of your website sending mail via its own SMTP server, outgoing email is directed through the Elastic Email service and out onto the internet.
The API Key is a 96-character single GUID and it is the key to your account when trying to gain access or make API calls while outside of the User Interface.
Every API call will require this key.
It is unique for API connections and separate from SMTP Relay communication.
