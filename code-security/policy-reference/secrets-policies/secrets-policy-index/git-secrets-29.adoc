=== Description 


To use the CircleCI API or view details about your pipelines, you will need API tokens with the appropriate permissions.
This document describes the types of API tokens available, as well as how to create and delete them.
There are two types of API token you can create within CircleCI.
Personal: These tokens are used to interact with the CircleCI API and grant full read and write permissions.
Project: These tokens allow you to read/write information for specific projects.
Project tokens have three scope options: Status, Read Only, and Admin.
- Status tokens grant read access to the project's build statuses.
Useful for embedding status badges.
- Read Only tokens grant read only access to the project's API.
- Admin tokens grant read and write access for the project's API.
