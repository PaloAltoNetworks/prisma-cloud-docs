=== Description

A Mailgun Domain Sending Key is a unique identifier used to authorize and authenticate email sending for a specific domain within the Mailgun email service. It is associated with a particular domain and grants permission to send emails using that domain. The Domain Sending Key should be kept secure, as it allows control over sending emails from the associated domain.
