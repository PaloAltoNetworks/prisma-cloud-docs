=== Description

A Mailgun Domain Sending Key is a unique identifier used to authorize and authenticate email sending for a specific domain within the Mailgun email service. It is associated with a particular domain and grants permission to send emails using that domain. The Domain Sending Key should be kept secure, as it allows control over sending emails from the associated domain.

To revoke a Mailgun Domain Sending Key:

1. Log into your Mailgun account.
2. From the dashboard, navigate to the 'Domains' section.
3. Select the domain for which you want to revoke the sending key.
4. In the domain settings, click on the 'Domain Settings' tab.
5. Scroll down to the 'Domain Sending' section.
6. Locate the sending key you want to revoke and click the 'Delete' or 'Revoke' button next to it.
7. Confirm the action when prompted.

Once the key is revoked, it can no longer be used to send emails for the associated domain. Ensure that you have an alternative method for sending emails configured if necessary.
