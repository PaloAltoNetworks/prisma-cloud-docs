=== Description

A Mapbox token, specifically referred to as an access token, is used to authenticate a user's requests to Mapbox APIs. This token allows you to integrate and use Mapbox's maps and services in your application. Each API request requires an access token that is associated with a Mapbox account. The token links all the changes made by the requests to that account, helping Mapbox identify the account and manage resource allocation.

*Mapbox*

To revoke a Mapbox access token:

1. Log into your Mapbox account.
2. Navigate to your Account page.
3. Go to the 'Access tokens' section.
4. Find the token you want to delete in the list of tokens.
5. Click the 'Delete' button that corresponds to the token you want to revoke.
6. A pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm that you want to delete the token. Click 'Delete' in the pop-up.

Remember, once a token is deleted, it can't be restored. So, make sure you no longer need the token before deleting it.
