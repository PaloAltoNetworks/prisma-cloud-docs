=== Description

A Flutterwave API Key, also known as a Secret Key, is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests made to the Flutterwave API. This key allows you to integrate Flutterwave's payment services into your application, enabling you to carry out transactions, manage refunds, etc. It's important to keep this key secure as it provides significant access to your Flutterwave account.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Flutterwave*

To revoke a Flutterwave API Key, you need to regenerate it. Here's how:

1. Log into your Flutterwave dashboard.
2. Navigate to 'Settings', then 'API'.
3. Click the 'Regenerate Key' button next to the Secret Key field.
4. You will be asked to confirm your password for security reasons.

Once regenerated, the old key becomes invalid, and you'll have a new Secret Key. Be sure to update your application with the new key as the old one will no longer work.
