=== Description 


The Postman API endpoints enable developers to integrate Postman within the development toolchain.
Developers can add new collections, update existing collections, update environments, and add and run monitors directly through the API.
This enables them to programmatically access data stored in a Postman account.
They can also combine the Postman API with Newman to integrate Postman with a CI/CD workflow.
