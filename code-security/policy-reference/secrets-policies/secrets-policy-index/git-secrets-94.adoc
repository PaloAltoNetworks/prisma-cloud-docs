=== Fix - Buildtime


*Mailgun*

To revoke a Mailgun API Key, you need to regenerate it. Here's how:

1. Log into your Mailgun account.
2. Click on your profile avatar at the top right, then select 'API Keys' from the dropdown menu.
3. Under 'API Keys', locate the 'Primary Account API Key'.
4. Click 'Regenerate Key'.
5. A pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm the action. Click 'Regenerate Key' to confirm.

This action revokes the old key and generates a new one. Ensure that you update all applications that use the old API Key to use the new one, as the old one will no longer work.
