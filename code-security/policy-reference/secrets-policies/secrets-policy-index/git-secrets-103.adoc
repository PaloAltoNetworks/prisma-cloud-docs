=== Description

A Typeform API Token is used to authenticate requests made to the Typeform API. This token is associated with your Typeform account and allows your application to access and manipulate your Typeform data, such as retrieving form responses or creating new forms. This token should be kept confidential because it allows significant access to your Typeform account and resources.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Typeform*

To revoke a Typeform API Token, you need to delete it. Here's how:

1. Log into your Typeform account.
2. Click on your avatar at the top right of the screen, then click on 'My Account'.
3. Go to the 'Personal Tokens' section under 'API TOKENS'.
4. Next to the token you want to revoke, click the 'Delete' button.
5. A confirmation pop-up will appear. Confirm your action, and the token will be revoked.

Remember, once you delete a token, it can't be restored, and any services relying on this token will stop working. So, be careful to update any dependent systems with a new token if necessary.
