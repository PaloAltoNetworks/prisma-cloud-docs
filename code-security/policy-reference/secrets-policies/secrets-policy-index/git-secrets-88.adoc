=== Description

A Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API key, also known as a Server key, is used to authorize and authenticate server-to-server communication for sending messages from your backend server to your Firebase project. It's essential for sending push notifications to Android devices or to browser clients via the FCM service.


=== Fix - Buildtime


*Firebase*

Firebase doesn't provide a direct way to revoke or regenerate a Server key (API Key). However, you can create a new Firebase project and switch your application to the new project. This effectively "revokes" the old key as it is no longer associated with an active Firebase project. After switching to the new project, remember to update the server key in your backend service to the one from the new project. This approach is not ideal and could be disruptive, especially for larger applications, so it's crucial to keep your Server key secure to avoid the need to change it. For the most current procedures, always refer to the latest Firebase documentation.
