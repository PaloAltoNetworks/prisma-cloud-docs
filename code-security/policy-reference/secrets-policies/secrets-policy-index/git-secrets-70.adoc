=== Description 


To use the Typeform Create, Responses, and Webhooks APIs, you need to pass your personal access token in the Authorization header of your requests.
Access tokens are long strings of random characters that look something like this: tfp_943af478d3ff3d4d760020c11af102b79c440513.
The access token is unique per developer.
It is used to identify a given user and make sure that only you can access your typeforms and results.
