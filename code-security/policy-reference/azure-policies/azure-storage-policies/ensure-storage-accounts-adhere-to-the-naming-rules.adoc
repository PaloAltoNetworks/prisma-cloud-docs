=== Description 


Azure has the following https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#naming-storage-accounts[rules for naming] your storage account:

* Names must be between 3 and 24 characters long
* Names may contain numbers and lowercase letters only
* Your storage account name must be unique

This policy ensures that you have not provided an invalid name for your Storage Account.
