=== Description 


WAF has two modes: Detection and Prevention.
In Detection mode, WAF analyzes incoming traffic to the Azure front door and logs any requests that are determined to be malicious based on a set of rules.
This can help you to identify potential security threats and take appropriate action to protect your application.
In Prevention mode, WAF analyzes incoming traffic to the application gateway and blocks any requests that are determined to be malicious based on a set of rules.
This can help to prevent malicious requests from reaching your application and potentially causing damage.
