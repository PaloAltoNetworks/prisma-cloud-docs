=== Description 


By disabling IP forwarding on the NIC of your Azure virtual machine, you can help to prevent the virtual machine from acting as a router and forwarding traffic to unintended destinations.
This can help to improve the security of your virtual machine and protect it from potential threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks or data breaches.
