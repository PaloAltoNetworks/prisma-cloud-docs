=== Description

Disabling debugging for your Azure App Service slot can help improve the security of your app.
Debugging allows you to troubleshoot issues with your app by providing access to detailed information about how the app is functioning.
However, it can also make it easier for attackers to gain access to sensitive information about your app, such as its code and configuration.
