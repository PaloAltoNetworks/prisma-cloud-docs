=== Description 


Using a vulnerable version of Apache Log4j library might enable attackers to exploit a Lookup mechanism that supports making requests using special syntax in a format string which can potentially lead to a risky code execution, data leakage and more.
Set your Front Door Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent executing such mechanism using the rule definition below.
Azure WAF has updated Default Rule Set (DRS) versions 1.0 and 1.1 with rule 944240 "`Remote Command Execution`" under Managed Rules to help in detecting and mitigating this vulnerability.
This rule is already enabled by default in block mode for all existing WAF Default Rule Set configurations.
