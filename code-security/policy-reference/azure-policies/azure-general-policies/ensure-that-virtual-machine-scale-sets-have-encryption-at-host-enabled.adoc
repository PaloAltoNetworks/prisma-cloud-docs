=== Description 


Use encryption at host to get end-to-end encryption for your virtual machine and virtual machine scale set data.
Encryption at host enables encryption at rest for your temporary disk and OS/data disk caches.
Temporary and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted with platform-managed keys when encryption at host is enabled.
OS/data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed key, depending on the encryption type selected on the disk.
