== GCP Dataproc Clusters have public IPs

Dataproc is commonly used for data lake modernization, ETL, and data science workloads.
A Dataproc cluster contains at least one "management" VM and one "compute" VM which are deployed into a VPC network.
A common misconfiguration is creating a *Dataproc cluster* with public IPs.
This security misconfiguration could put your data at risk of accidental exposure, because a public IP accompanied by an open firewall rule allows potentially unauthorized access to the underlining Dataproc VMs.
We recommend you only assign private IPs to your Dataproc clusters.

* GCP Console* 


It is not currently possible to edit a running * Dataproc cluster* to remove it's public IPs.
To create a * Dataproc cluster* with only private IPs:

. Log in to the GCP Console.

. Navigate to https://urldefense.com/v3/%5F%5Fhttps://console.cloud.google.com/dataproc/clustersAdd%5F%5F;!!Mt_FR42WkD9csi9Y!PObL5n10Gkw-7w659OQCGsznK2hEIiTF4FRanyTSwxjHt_5T7NWzzLsaA9BnNO6HvFz-$[Dataproc].

. Select _Customize Cluster_ to view * Network Configuration* settings.

. Locate the _Internal IP Only_ section and select the checkbox next to * Configure all instances to have only internal IP addresses*


* CLI Command* 


It is not currently possible to edit a running * Dataproc cluster* to remove it's public IPs.
To create a * Dataproc cluster* with only private IPs you need to specify the `--no-address` flag.
As an example:


[source,shell]
----
{
 "gcloud beta dataproc clusters create my_cluster  \\
  --region=us-central1  \\
  --no-address",
}
----

*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_dataproc_cluster
* *Field:* internal_ip_only


[source,go]
----
resource "google_dataproc_cluster" "accelerated_cluster" {
  name   = "my-cluster-with-gpu"
  region = "us-central1"

  cluster_config {
    gce_cluster_config {
      zone = "us-central1-a"
-     internal_ip_only = false
+     internal_ip_only = true
    }

    master_config {
      accelerators {
        accelerator_type  = "nvidia-tesla-k80"
        accelerator_count = "1"
      }
    }
