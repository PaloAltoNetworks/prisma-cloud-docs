=== Description 


Allowing anonymous or public access to a Cloud Storage bucket grants permissions to anyone to access the bucket's content.
If you are storing sensitive data in the bucket anonymous and public access may not be desired.
We recommend you ensure anonymous and public access to a bucket is not allowed.
