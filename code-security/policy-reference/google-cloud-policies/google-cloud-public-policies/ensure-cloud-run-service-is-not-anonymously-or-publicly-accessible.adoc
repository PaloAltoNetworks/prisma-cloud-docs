== GCP Cloud Run services are anonymously or publicly accessible

Cloud Run services are fully managed serverless environments used to develop and deploy containerized applications.
In GCP, Cloud Run services support a wide variety of authentication methods to execute (invoke) the container.
One of those methods is based to the usage of two special IAM principals: _allUsers_ and _allAuthenticatedUsers_.
When those IAM principals have access to the Cloud Run service - anyone on the internet can execute or access the Cloud Run service.
We recommend you ensure that neither anonymous or public access to Cloud Run services are allowed.
