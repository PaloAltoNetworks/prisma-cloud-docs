=== Description 


Cloud Dataflow in GCP is a service used for streaming and batch data processing.
A Dataflow job consists of at least one management node and one compute node (both are GCE VMs).
By default, these nodes are configured with public IPs that allow them to communicate with the public internet, but this also means they increase your potential attack surface by being publicly accessible.
We recommend you remove the public IPs for your Dataflow jobs.
View the https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/routes-firewall#internet_access_for[official Google documentation] for the currently supported internet access configuration options.

=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console Making Dataflow jobs private via the console is not currently supported.* 




* CLI Command* 


Making * running* Dataflow jobs private via the `gcloud` CLI is not currently supported.
Instead, you need to * drain* or * cancel* your job and then re-create with the correct flag configured.


[source,shell]
----
{
 "# To cancel a Dataflow job
gcloud dataflow jobs cancel JOB_ID",
}
----

Replace * JOB_ID* with your Dataflow job ID.


[source,shell]
----
{
 "# To drain a Dataflow job
gcloud dataflow jobs drain JOB_ID",
       
}
----
Replace * JOB_ID* with your Dataflow job ID.


[source,shell]
----
{
 "# To create a new Dataflow job without public IPs
gcloud dataflow jobs run JOB_NAME \\
  --disable-public-ips \\
  --gcs-location=GCS_LOCATION",
       
}
----
Replace * JOB_ID* with your Dataflow job ID.
Replace * GCS_LOCATION* with the GCS bucket name where your job template lives.
Must be a URL beginning with `gs://`.
Google also provides documentation on how to https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/routes-firewall#turn_off_external_ip_address[Turn off external IP address] for your Dataflow jobs.
This documentation has examples for * Java* and * Python*.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_dataflow_job
* *Field:* ip_configuration


[source,go]
----
resource "google_dataflow_job" "big_data_job" {
  name              = "dataflow-job"
  template_gcs_path = "gs://my-bucket/templates/template_file"
  temp_gcs_location = "gs://my-bucket/tmp_dir"
  parameters = {
    foo = "bar"
    baz = "qux"
  }

-  ip_configuration = "WORKER_IP_PUBLIC"
+  ip_configuration = "WORKER_IP_PRIVATE"
}
