=== Description 


In order to prevent use of legacy networks, a project should not have a legacy network configured.
Legacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network.
The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions.
Subnetworks cannot be created in a legacy network and are unable to switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks.
Legacy networks can have an impact for high network traffic projects and are subject to a single point of contention or failure.
