=== Description 


A service account is a special Google account that belongs to an application or a VM, not to an individual end-user.
The application uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that users are not directly involved.
Service accounts represent service-level security of application or VM Resources, determined by the roles assigned to them.
Enrolling *ServiceAccount* with Admin rights gives full access to an assigned application or a VM.
A ServiceAccount Access holder can perform critical actions, such as delete and update change settings, without user intervention.
We recommend you do not grant Admin privileges for *ServiceAccount*.

=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console To change the policy using the GCP Console, follow these steps:* 



. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam [IAM Admin].

. Navigate to * Members*.

. Identify * User-Managed user created* service account with roles containing * __Admin** or **__admin* or roles matching * Editor* or * Owner*.

. Click the * Trash* icon to remove the role from the member.
+
In this case service account.


* CLI Command* 



. Using a text editor, remove * Role* that contains * roles/__Admin** or **roles/__admin* or matches * roles/editor* or * roles/owner*.
+
Add a role to the bindings array that defines the group members and the role for those members.

. Update the project's IAM policy: `gcloud projects set-iam-policy PROJECT_ID iam.json`
