=== Description 


The *local_infile* database flag controls the server-side LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA statements.
Depending on the *local_infile* setting, the server refuses or permits local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.
To explicitly cause the server to refuse LOAD DATA LOCAL statements start *mysqld* with *local_infile* disabled, regardless of how client programs and libraries are configured at build time or runtime.
*local_infile* can also be set at runtime.
We recommended you set the *local_infile* database flag for a Cloud SQL MySQL instance to *off* to address the security issues associated with the flag.


////
=== Fix - Runtime


* GCP Console To change the policy using the GCP Console, follow these steps:* 



. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.

. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances [Cloud SQL Instances].

. Select the * MySQL instance* where the database flag needs to be enabled.

. Click * Edit*.

. Scroll down to the * Flags* section.

. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click * Add item*.

. Select the flag * local_infile* from the drop-down menu, and set its value to * off*.

. Click * Save*.

. Confirm the changes in the * Flags* section on the * Overview* page.


* CLI Command* 



. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:  `gcloud sql instances list`

. Configure the local_infile database flag for every Cloud SQL Mysql database instance using the below command:  `gcloud sql instances patch INSTANCE_NAME --database-flags local_infile=off`
+
NOTE: This command will overwrite all database flags previously set. To keep those flags, and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance.Any flag not specifically included is set to its default value.
For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign (*=*).

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_sql_database_instance
* *Arguments:* database_version = "MYSQL_* " 
settings::database_flags: key:"local_infile", value:  by default set to "on"


[source,go]

resource "google_sql_database_instance" "default" {
  name             = "master-instance"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = "us-central1"

  settings {
+         database_flags {
