=== Description 


Stackdriver is the default logging solution for clusters deployed on GKE.
Stackdriver logging is deployed to a new cluster by default, explicitly set to *opt-out*.
Stackdriver logging collects only the container's standard output and standard error streams.
To ingest logs, Stackdriver logging agent must be deployed to each node in the cluster.
Stackdriver provides a single-pane-of-glass view of metrics, logs, and traces through Kubernetes Engine clusters and workloads.
We recommend you use Stackdriver logging as a unified data logging solution for GKE workloads unless additional observability tooling is already in place.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform*
