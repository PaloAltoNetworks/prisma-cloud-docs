=== Description

GCP Data fusion is a fully managed, cloud-native data integration service that helps users build and manage ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipelines.
It is designed to simplify and accelerate the process of building and maintaining data pipelines, allowing users to create data pipelines that can ingest data from a variety of sources, transform and cleanse the data, and then load the data into a destination of their choice.
A Data Fusion instance is a logical container that is used to host and run data pipelines.
It is created within a Google Cloud project, and users can create multiple instances within a single project.
Each instance has its own resources and configuration settings, allowing users to tailor the instance to their specific needs.
We recommend you remove the public IPs for your Data Fusion instance.
