=== Description 


Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
It offers data encryption at rest and in transit, Private connectivity with VPC and user-controlled network access with firewall protection.
Cloud SQL creates a server certificate automatically when a new instance is created.
