=== Description 


Define the authentication types that your API supports for OpenAPI/Swagger 2.0 in securityDefinitions.
HNot defining authentication types exposes your APIs to attacks, while not documenting the authentication type makes it more difficult to understand how to access your API.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*OpenAPI* 


Ensure that your OpenAPI 2.0 spec includes a securityDefinitions section.
For example:
[source,yaml]
----
securityDefinitions:
BasicAuth:
type: basic
ApiKeyAuth:
type: apiKey
in: header
name: apiKey
OAuth2:
type: oauth2
flow: implicit
authorizationUrl: https://swagger.io/api/oauth/dialog
tokenUrl: https://swagger.io/api/oauth/token
scopes:
read: read
write: write
