=== Description 


This policy identifies the OCI Object Storage buckets that are publicly accessible.
Monitoring and alerting on publicly accessible buckets will help in identifying changes to the security posture and thus reduces risk for sensitive data being leaked.
It is recommended that no bucket be publicly accessible.
