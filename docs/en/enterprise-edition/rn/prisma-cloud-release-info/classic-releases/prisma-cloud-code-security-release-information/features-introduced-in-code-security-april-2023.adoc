|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Private Registries*
|To increase the accuracy of dependency trees and fix suggestions in  SCA (Software Composition Analysis)  based on your environment, you can now integrate your private registries from *Settings > Repositories > Add Repositories > Package Registries > Artifactory*.
Integrating Private Registries helps you identify accurate dependency trees for packages within your repositories.
On the console you can see a list of Private Registries integrations (*Settings > Repositories*). You can remediate vulnerabilities on *Code Security > Projects > Vulnerabilities* and also make informed decisions from *Code Security > Supply Chain* after viewing the dependency tree of a private registry.

|*Validate Secrets during a Secrets scan*
|When Prisma Cloud performs a https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/secrets-scanning[secrets scan], it can now validate certain secrets against public APIs to see if the secret is still active. This allows you to prioritize notifications on secret exposure.
Validation is off by default, but you can enable it *Settings > Code Security Configuration > Validate Secrets*.
You can access information on validation of secrets on *Projects > Secrets*, using *Resource Explorer* where prioritization of a valid secret is either to *Suppress* it or perform a *Manual Fix*. Alternatively you can run Checkov on your repositories to filter potentially exposed secrets.
