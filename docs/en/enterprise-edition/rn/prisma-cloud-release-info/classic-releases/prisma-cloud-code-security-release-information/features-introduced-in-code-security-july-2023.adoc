|DESCRIPTION

|*Integrated View of Run and Build details for Alerts*
//RLP-103734 - Moved from LGA to GA in 23.7.2
|To help you as a Cloud Security Engineer investigate issues from code to cloud, the alert details now include information to trace and attribute which build-time resource has caused a policy violation for a runtime resource deployed in your cloud account. The alert details overview includes the IaC resource details and information on the build time resource. The new Traceability information helps you connect an alert from the production environment back to the origin templates in your upstream development environment.

To view the build-time details in an alert:

* You must enable a Configuration policy with the subtype Run, Build and attach it to an alert rule on Prisma Cloud.

* Your IaC templates must be onboarded through a VCS integration.

* Terraform resources must include the *yor_trace* tag so that your IaC resources are tagged with a unique UUID for tracing the relationship between the code resource and the runtime resource that is deployed from it. This is not necessary for CloudFormation.
