|*Severity Based Actions for Packages in Vulnerability Rules*
//CWP-42985
|https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/vuln_management_rules[Vulnerability policy rules] can now be scoped based on the severity threshold per package, in addition to scoping the vulnerabilities by collections.
You can now define the severity threshold per package type for alert and block actions.

The package type severity thresholds apply to all workload types: deployed images, CI Images, hosts, VM images, functions, and CI Functions.
With this feature, you can monitor alerts at a granular level and focus on vulnerabilities in specific packages.

|*Parallel Registry Scanning*
//CWP-49316
|You can now trigger a registry scan when configuring the registry under *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Registry*. As you add more registries, the new scans are queued until the previous scan finishes.

With this update, you can initiate a new scan from *Monitor > Vulnerabilities* while previous scans are in progress.
