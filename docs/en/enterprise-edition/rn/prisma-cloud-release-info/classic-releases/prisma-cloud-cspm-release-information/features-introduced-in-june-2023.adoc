|DESCRIPTION

|*IAM Security metrics included in Cloud Security Report powered by Adoption Advisor* 
tt:[Enhancement] 

|Implement least-privileged access by quantifying and sharing key IAM security metrics, such as unused over-privileged permissions, now available in the Prisma Cloud Cloud Security report powered by Adoption Advisor. These newly surfaced KPIs allow you to minimize the attack surface by restricting excessive permissions that may pose a significant security risk. 

Navigate to *Adoption Advisor > Create Report* from the Prisma Cloud administrative console to explore the latest available IAM security metrics.

|DESCRIPTION

|*GCP VM instance that is reachable from untrust internet source to ports with high risk*
//RLP-98680
|Identifies GCP VM instances that are reachable from untrusted internet sources to ports with high risk. VM instances with unrestricted access to the internet for high risky port may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

|*AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal*
//RLP-99453

|*Changes—* Updating Policy Name, and Description  

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium 

*Policy Name—* AWS S3 buckets are accessible to public

*Updated Policy Name—* AWS S3 buckets are accessible to public via ACL

*Description-* The policy name, description, and recommendation steps are updated to be specific on the criteria through which the S3 bucket is made public. Amazon S3 often stores highly sensitive enterprise data, allowing public access to S3 buckets through ACL results in sensitive data being compromised. It is highly recommended to disable ACL configuration for all S3 buckets and use resource based policies to allow access to S3 buckets.

*Impact—* No impact, as this is a metadata change.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal*
//RLP-99453

|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL are updated. The RQL now considers *Block public access* settings configuration at account and bucket Level.

*Updated Description—*
Identifies the S3 buckets that have a bucket policy overly permissive to any principal and don't have Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies enabled. It is recommended to follow the principle of least privileges ensuring that the only restricted entities have permission on S3 operations instead of any anonymous.

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium. 

*Current RQL—*

----

|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.4.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2) is a set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security posture. Benchmarks are tied to specific Kubernetes releases. The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is written for open-source Kubernetes distribution and is intended to be universally applicable. Based on the existing CIS Benchmark, this standard adds additional Google Cloud-specific controls.

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.

|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 23.1.1 release.]
//RLP-76433

|If you currently ingest AWS flow logs using S3 with the 24-hour partition, you need to change it to the hourly partition.

To make this change, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-flow-logs[Configure Flow Logs] to use the hourly partition and enable the required additional fields.

*Impact*— VPC Flow logs with partitions set to *Every 24 hours (default)* will be disabled. As a result, you will no longer be able to monitor or receive alerts for these logs.
