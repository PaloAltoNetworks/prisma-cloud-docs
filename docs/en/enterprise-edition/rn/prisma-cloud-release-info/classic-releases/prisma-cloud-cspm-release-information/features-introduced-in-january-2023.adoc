|DESCRIPTION

|*Cloud Account Onboarding for more Security Coverage*
//RLP-87499/87501/87502

|Prisma Cloud provides an improved and simplified onboarding experience, by providing you with the option to select which security capabilities you want and by creating the role with the permissions required for those capabilities.

You can now enable *Agentless Workload Scanning*, *Serverless Function Scanning*, *Agent Based Workload Protection*, *Data Security*, and *Remediation* capabilities as part of the new onboarding workflow for your https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws[AWS], https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-azure-account[Azure], and https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-gcp[GCP] cloud accounts using minimal steps.

* After you successfully onboard your cloud account on Prisma Cloud, by default, the account is automatically available in Compute and enabled for Workload Discovery and Serverless function scans.

* The option to enable Data Security is now part of the onboarding workflow and is only available for AWS and Azure cloud accounts.

image::onboard_1_2.png[scale=30]
* For previously onboarded cloud accounts, when you Edit the account and enable or disable the additional security capabilities, the permissions for the Prisma Cloud role is updated. You must download the CFT again and apply it on the Cloud Service Provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) to apply the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the capabilities you have enabled, make sure to follow the steps to configure https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning[Agentless Workload Scanning], https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/serverless_functions[Serverless Function Scanning], and Agent Based Workload Protection.

|*Ingest Audit Logs using Amazon EventBridge*
//RLP-78526

|By default, Prisma Cloud uses the Amazon CloudTrail service to ingest audit logs. Event assisted ingestion is an enhancement that makes the API call only if the resource configuration is changed. After onboarding your AWS account, you can now configure https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-audit-logs[Amazon EventBridge] on Prisma Cloud to support event assisted ingestion in near real time, which allows Prisma Cloud to reduce the total number of API calls and total time to alert.

image::aws-configure-eventbridge1.png[scale=30]

|*Support for AWS GuardDuty and Inspector Malware Findings*
//RLP-77066

|After onboarding your AWS account on Prisma Cloud and configuring EventBridge, you can now https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-findings[Configure Findings] to view vulnerability and malware findings generated by AWS GuardDuty or vulnerabilities generated by AWS Inspector on the Prima Cloud Resource page. Once enabled, if GuardDuty detects suspicious activity on a workload, it initiates a malware scan on the associated EC2 instance. If malware is detected during the scan, GuardDuty generates an additional finding. The findings provide context and can detect the malicious software that is the source of the suspicious behavior, so that you can take appropriate response actions.

|tt:[GA] *Recurring Reports for Adoption Advisor*
//RLP-67981
|You can now schedule a recurring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/adoption-advisor[Adoption Advisor] Report to receive a summary of your adoption and improvements on our cloud security posture at regular cadence. You can schedule the report to run on a daily, weekly, or monthly intervals, and view a list of all scheduled reports under *Adoption Advisor > Reports*.

image::aa-create-report.png[scale=30]

|*Support for AWS IAM Identity Center*
//RLP-88304

|Prisma Cloud now integrates with https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-aws-id-center[AWS IAM Identity Center], providing you complete visibility into the access privileges of users currently using AWS IAM Identity Center to log into AWS, this includes users and groups created in or imported into Identity Center. You can also create access policies, user alerts and remediate risky permissions for AWS IAM Identity Center users. Prisma Cloud does require additional permissions to support AWS IAM Identity Center integration. If you are using a CloudFormation template for AWS account onboarding no additional action is required. The required permissions are part of the CloudFormation onboarding template. You can also manually add permissions to take advantage of AWS IAM Identity Center.

|*Retrieval of Data Storage Size Estimates for Azure Blob Storage*
//RLP-84900

|Prisma Cloud now retrieves the approximate storage size of your Azure blob storage and storage for sensitive data scanning and provides an estimate credit consumption required to scan your Azure blob storage. The size of scannable data is based on file size and file type. The estimates in Azure leverages the Azure Inventory policies and creates files on a daily or weekly basis.  You can choose to follow a few https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/troubleshoot-data-security-errors[recommendations] to lower your cost.

|*Changes—* The recommendation steps have been updated according to the CSP changes.

*Impact—* Low. Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.


|*Azure SQL Server allow access to any Azure internal resources*
//RLP-87564

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure log profile not capturing activity logs for all regions*
//RLP-87560

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure subscriptions with custom roles are overly permissive*
//RLP-87520

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies azure subscriptions with custom roles are overly permissive. Least privilege access rule should be followed and only necessary privileges should be assigned instead of allowing full administrative access.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

|*Azure storage account has a blob container with public access*
//RLP-87470

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Storage Account 'Trusted Microsoft Services' access not enabled*
//RLP-86542

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Storage Accounts which have 'Trusted Microsoft Services' access not enabled. Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account. If the Allow trusted Microsoft services exception is enabled, the following services: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Networking, Azure Monitor and Azure SQL Data Warehouse (when registered in the subscription), are granted access to the storage account. It is recommended to enable Trusted Microsoft Services on storage account instead of leveraging network rules.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure storage account logging for queues is disabled*
//RLP-86483

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Storage Accounts without Secure transfer enabled*
//RLP-86367

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Current Policy Name—* Storage Accounts without Secure transfer enabled
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure Storage Account without Secure transfer enabled

*Updated Policy Description—* 
identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection. When 'secure transfer required' is enabled, REST APIs to access your storage accounts connect using HTTPs any requests using HTTP will be rejected. When you are using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail. It is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.

[NOTE]
====
Azure storage does not support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name.
====

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Storage accounts soft delete is disabled*
//RLP-86280

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and remediation CLI descriptions have been updated.

*Current Policy Name—* Azure Storage accounts soft delete is disabled

*Updated Policy Name—* Azure Storage account soft delete is disabled

*Updated Policy Description—*
Identifies Azure Storage accounts which has soft delete disabled. Azure Storage contains important access logs, financial data, personal and other secret information which is accidentally deleted by a user or application could cause data loss or data unavailability. It is recommended to enable soft delete setting in Azure Storage accounts.

*Updated Remediation CLI Description—*
This CLI command requires 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/write' permission. Successful execution will enable soft delete for blobs on Azure Storage accounts. NOTE: As best practice we are setting delete retention days to 30 days; it can be changed based on customer requirement by cloning the policy.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatic provisioning of log Analytics agent for Azure VMs is set to Off*
//RLP-85265

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the lastest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior2]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*‘Monitor and Protect’ renamed Remediation*

|With the Cloud Account Onboarding changes for more Security Coverage, the Monitor and Monitor & Protect modes are revised. For an existing account that was onboarded with Monitor & Protect mode, the Remediation security capability represents the mode. 

image::monitor-protect-behavior-change.png[scale=30]

These modes are no longer available when onboarding new cloud accounts. For the new workflow, see Cloud Account Onboarding for more Security Coverage.

image::onboard_1_2.png[scale=30]

|tt:[Update] *AWS Account Onboarding*

|During onboarding your AWS cloud account on Prisma Cloud, if you are already logged in to your AWS management console, you can either *Download IAM Role CFT* or *Create IAM Role* on the fly.

image::aws-create-iam-role-1.png[scale=30]

When you click *Create IAM Role*, Prisma Cloud creates a dynamic link that takes you directly to the *Quick create stack* page in the AWS management console. 

image::aws-quick-create-stack-1.png[scale=30]

You do not need to enter the template details manually in order to create the stack, it is auto-populated  based on the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* you have selected. 


|*Google Kubernetes Engine Container ClusterID Update*
//RLP-80880

|The resource ID for the *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* API in Prisma Cloud is updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts for these resources are resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-container-describe-clusters* APIs resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

[#new-compliance-benchmarks-and-updates2]
=== New Compliance Benchmarks and Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)*

//RLP-85048
|Prisma Cloud now supports the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance standard.

In addition to improving the accuracy of corporate disclosures, SOX protects shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent business practices. Corporations must save all business records, including electronic records and electronic messages, for "not less than five years" to comply with SOX.
Non-compliance can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

|*CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v2.0.0 (Level 1 and Level 2)*

//RLP-89500
|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v2.0.0 is based on the CIS Google Cloud Computing Platform Foundations Benchmark v1.0.0 published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The CIS benchmark provides guidance to securing the GCP environment, covering everything from network to servers to operating systems. The important sections covered in the benchmark include IAM, Logging and monitoring configuration, Virtual Network Security settings, and Kubernetes Engine configuration.

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.  

|*CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.3.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2)*

//RLP-89501
|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.3.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2) is a set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security posture. Benchmarks are tied to specific Kubernetes releases. The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is written for the open source Kubernetes distribution and is intended to be universally applicable. Based on the existing CIS Benchmark, this standard adds additional controls that are Google Cloud-specific. 

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = permissionGrantPolicyIdsAssignedToDefaultUserRole[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-active-directory-authorization-policy' AND json.rule = defaultUserRolePermissions.permissionGrantPoliciesAssigned[*] contains microsoft-user-default-legacy
----

*Impact—* Low. Previously generated alerts will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

|*SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured*
//RLP-84336

|*Changes—* The policy Name, Description, and Recommendation steps have been updated to maintain consistency across policies. The RQL has been updated with a new RQL grammar that will improve the accuracy of the results.

*Current Policy Name—* SQL servers which do not have Azure Active Directory admin configured
*Updated Policy Name—* Azure SQL server not configured with Active Directory admin authentication

*Updated Policy Description—* 
Identifies Azure SQL servers that are not configured with Active Directory admin authentication. Azure Active Directory authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Microsoft Azure SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse by using identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). With Azure AD authentication, you can centrally manage the identities of database users and other Microsoft services in one central location. As a best practice, configure SQL servers with Active Directory admin authentication. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = '$.serverAdmins !exists or $.serverAdmins[] size equals 0 or ($.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType exists and $.serverAdmins[].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and $.serverAdmins[].properties.login is not empty)'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = serverAdmins does not exist or serverAdmins[*] size equals 0 or (serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType exists and serverAdmins[*].properties.administratorType does not equal ActiveDirectory and serverAdmins[*].properties.login is not empty)
----

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*Azure Virtual Network subnet is not configured with a Network Security Group*
//RLP-85282

|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to ignore the case sensitive of the parameter value.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name is not member of ("GatewaySubnet", "AzureFirewallSubnet") and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-network-subnet-list' AND json.rule = networkSecurityGroupId does not exist and name does not equal ignore case "GatewaySubnet" and name does not equal ignore case "AzureFirewallSubnet" and ['properties.delegations'][*].['properties.serviceName'] does not equal "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" and ['properties.privateEndpointNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled and ['properties.privateLinkServiceNetworkPolicies'] equals Enabled
----

*Impact—* Low. Previous generated alert for gateway subnets where the name is not as GatewaySubnet will be resolved as Policy_Updated.

2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

//RLP-85132

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the latest CSP changes.

*Updated Policy Description—*
Identifies Storage accounts which have default network access is set to 'Allow'. Restricting default network access helps to provide a new layer of security, since storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, the default action must be changed.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Stackdriver Logging disabled*
//RLP-76349

|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the latest CSP changes.

*Current Policy Name—* GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Stackdriver Logging disabled
*Updated Policy Name—* GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Cloud Logging disabled

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.

|*GCP User managed service accounts have user managed service account keys*
//RLP-77809

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the latest CSP changes.

*Impact—* No impact on alerts.


|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Legacy Authorization enabled*
//RLP-83280

|*Changes—* The policy recommendation steps have been updated to reflect the latest CSP changes. The remediation CLI has been removed because there is no single cli command that can update both Zonal and Regional GKE clusters.

*Impact—* Changes to recommendation steps will have no impact on existing alerts. There is no remediation support available.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Monitor and Protect renamed Remediation*

|With the Cloud Account Onboarding changes for more Security Coverage, the *Monitor* and *Monitor & Protect* modes are revised. For an existing account that was onboarded with *Monitor & Protect* mode, the *Remediation* security capability represents the mode. 

image::onboard-old-monitor-protect.png[scale=20]

These modes are no longer available when onboarding new cloud accounts. For the new workflow, see *Cloud Account Onboarding for More Security Coverage*. 

image::onboard-sec-perms-remediation.png[scale=20]

|tt:[Update] *AWS Account Onboarding*

|During onboarding your AWS cloud account on Prsima Cloud, if you are already logged in to your AWS management console, you can either *Download IAM Role CFT* or *Create IAM Role* on the fly.

image::aws-create-iam-role-1.png[scale=20]

When you click *Create IAM Role*, Prisma Cloud creates a dynamic link that takes you directly to the *Quick create stack* page in the AWS management console. You do not need to enter the template details manually in order to create the stack, it is auto-populated  based on the *Security Capabilities and Permissions* you’ve selected.

|*Google BigQuery API Resource ID Update*
//RLP-80884

|The resource ID for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* in Prisma Cloud is updated in the backend. As a result, all resources for *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources is resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced count for the number of alerts. However, once the resources for the *gcloud-bigquery-dataset-list* API resumes ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.


|*Near Zero Rate Limit Exception for GCP APIs*
//RLP-86121

|You must enable the following GCP APIs for each project that the Prisma Cloud service account accesses to monitor and protect your GCP resources. If you have onboarded your GCP account at the Organization level, this configuration ensures that the API rate limit quota is applied to each GCP project that is part of the onboarded GCP Organization, and not counted entirely towards the project where the service account is created.

* `logging.googleapis.com` 
* `monitoring.googleapis.com` 
* `pubsub.googleapis.com` 
* `serviceusage.googleapis.com` 
* `firebaserules.googleapis.com`

*Impact*—No impact on alerts.
