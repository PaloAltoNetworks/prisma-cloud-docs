|DESCRIPTION

|*Updates to Workload Defense Metrics on Adoption Advisor*
//RLP-79842

|The Adoption Advisor dashboard and report now provide valuable insights on your workload defense coverage through both agentless scanning and Defenders. In addition to the information on how many hosts and cloud accounts are protected with Defenders, you can now review how many hosts are scanned using agentless security. This way, you'll have a comprehensive picture of the total number of hosts that are protected and scanned using Prisma Cloud.

[#new-policies2]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS Lambda function URL having overly permissive cross-origin resource sharing permissions*
//RLP-107981
|Identifies AWS Lambda functions which have overly permissive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) permissions. Overly permissive CORS settings (allowing wildcards) can potentially expose the Lambda function to unwarranted requests and cross-site scripting attacks. It is highly recommended to specify the exact domains (in 'allowOrigins') and HTTP methods (in 'allowMethods') that should be allowed to interact with your function to ensure a secure setup.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name= 'aws-lambda-list-functions' AND json.rule = cors exists and cors.allowOrigins[*] contains "*" and cors.allowMethods[*] contains "*"
----

|*AWS Auto Scaling group launch configuration has public IP address assignment enabled*
//RLP-106335
|Identifies the autoscaling group launch configuration that is configured to assign a public IP address. Auto Scaling groups assign a public IP address to the group's ec2 instances if its associated launch configuration is configured to assign a public IP address. Amazon EC2 instances should only be accessible from behind a load balancer instead of being directly exposed to the internet. It is recommended that the Amazon EC2 instances in an autoscaling group launch configuration do not have an associated public IP address except for limited edge cases.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-autoscaling-launch-configuration' AND json.rule = associatePublicIpAddress exists and associatePublicIpAddress is true
----

|*AWS Auto Scaling group launch configuration configured with Instance Metadata Service hop count greater than 1*
//RLP-106214
|Identifies the autoscaling group launch configuration where the Instance Metadata Service network hops count is set to greater than 1. A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. With the metadata response hop limit count for the IMDS greater than 1, the PUT response that contains the secret token can travel outside the EC2 instance. Only metadata with a limited hop count for all your EC2 instances is recommended.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-autoscaling-launch-configuration' AND json.rule = metadataOptions.httpEndpoint exists and metadataOptions.httpEndpoint equals "enabled" and metadataOptions.httpPutResponseHopLimit greater than 1 as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-describe-auto-scaling-groups' as Y; filter ' $.X.launchConfigurationName equal ignore case $.Y.launchConfigurationName'; show X;
----

|*AWS Auto Scaling group launch configuration not configured with Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2)*
//RLP-106211
|Identifies the autoscaling group launch configuration where IMDSv2 is set to optional. A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. With IMDSv2, every request is now protected by session authentication. Version 2 of the IMDS adds new protections that weren't available in IMDSv1 to further safeguard your EC2 instances created by the autoscaling group. It is recommended to use only IMDSv2 for all your EC2 instances.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-ec2-autoscaling-launch-configuration' AND json.rule = (metadataOptions.httpEndpoint does not exist) or (metadataOptions.httpEndpoint equals "enabled" and metadataOptions.httpTokens equals "optional") as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-describe-auto-scaling-groups' as Y; filter ' $.X.launchConfigurationName equal ignore case $.Y.launchConfigurationName'; show X;
----

|*Azure Database for MySQL server not configured private endpoint*
//RLP-107731
|Identifies Azure MySQL database servers that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for MySQL.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-mysql-server' AND json.rule = properties.userVisibleState equal ignore case Ready and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty
----

|*Azure Cache for Redis not configured with data in-transit encryption*
//RLP-108243
|Identifies Azure Cache for Redis which are not configured with data encryption in transit. Enforcing an SSL connection helps prevent unauthorized users from reading sensitive data that is intercepted as it travels through the network, between clients/applications and cache servers, known as data in transit.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-cache-redis' AND json.rule = properties provisioningState equal ignore case Succeeded and properties.enableNonSslPort is true
----

|*Azure PostgreSQL servers not configured private endpoint*
//RLP-107733
|Identifies Azure PostgreSQL database servers that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Azure PostgreSQL database.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-postgresql-server' AND json.rule = properties.userVisibleState equal ignore case Ready and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty
----

|*Azure SQL Database server not configured private endpoint*
//RLP-107732
|Identifies Azure SQL database servers that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for SQL. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Azure SQL database.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-sql-server-list' AND json.rule = properties.userVisibleState equal ignore case Ready and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty

|*Azure Database for MariaDB not configured private endpoint*
//RLP-107730
|Identifies Azure MariaDB database servers that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for MariaDB. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Azure MariaDB database.

*Policy Severity—* Medium

*Policy Type—* Config

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-database-maria-db-server' AND json.rule = properties.userVisibleState equal ignore case Ready and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty

|DESCRIPTION

|*Attack Path Analysis and Visualization*
//RLP-105197

|Prisma Cloud now includes attack path analysis and visualization that identifies attack paths and presents them in a graph view, offering valuable security context to protect against high-risk threats. It is an automated process that identifies the exposed vulnerable assets and indicates the likelihood of a breach which often requires immediate action. Whenever there is a policy violation, the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-policies/attack-path-policies[attack path policy] generates an alert as long as there is a matching alert rule. You can see additional information in the graph view by clicking on the node. Additionally, the asset detail view displays the finding types and vulnerabilities. To review these policies, select *Policies* and filter by Policy Type *Attack Path*. Attack Path policies are not available in China and Government regions.

|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Unusual Usage of Workload Credentials Anomaly Policies*
//RLP-99223
|Two new anomaly policies are now available in Prisma Cloud.

* Unusual usage of Workload Credentials from outside the Cloud
* Unusual usage of Workload Credentials from inside the Cloud

The policies detect the use of a credential assigned to a compute resource from a different resource, which could be outside or inside the cloud service provider. This is typically a sign of an attack or a very unusual use of resource credentials. The policies will be triggered based on whether the anomalous IP address is outside or inside the cloud provider’s IP address range. 

You can configure the *Unusual usage of Workload Credentials from inside the Cloud* policy from the new *Identity* section that is available in the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/define-prisma-cloud-enterprise-settings[anomaly settings].

Severity—Medium.

[NOTE]
====
These two policies require the IAM security (CIEM) module to be enabled.

|*AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk associated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk Instance*
//RLP-106032
|Identifies AWS Route53 Hosted Zones which have dangling DNS records with subdomain takeover risk. A Route53 Hosted Zone having a CNAME entry pointing to a non-existing Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) will have a risk of these dangling domain entries being taken over by an attacker by creating a similar Elastic beanstalk (EBS) in any AWS account which the attacker owns / controls. Attackers can use this domain to do phishing attacks, spread malware and other illegal activities. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete dangling DNS records entry from your AWS Route 53 hosted zones.

----
