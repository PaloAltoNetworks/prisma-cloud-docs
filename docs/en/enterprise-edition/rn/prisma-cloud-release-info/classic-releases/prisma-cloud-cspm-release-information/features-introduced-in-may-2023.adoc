|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Azure Virtual Machine that is reachable from any untrust internet source to ports with high risk*
//RLP-98700

|Identifies Azure Virtual machines that are reachable from any untrust internet source to ports with high risk. Azure VMs with untrusted access to high risky ports may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorized access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Severity—* High

*RQL—*
----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'Azure' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/20', 'tcp/21', 'tcp/23', 'tcp/25', 'tcp/110', 'tcp/135', 'tcp/143', 'tcp/445', 'tcp/1433:1434', 'tcp/3000', 'tcp/3306', 'tcp/4333', 'tcp/5000', 'tcp/5432', 'tcp/5500', 'tcp/5601', 'tcp/8080', 'tcp/8088', 'tcp/8888', 'tcp/9200', 'tcp/9300' ) and dest.resource.state = 'Active'  
----


|*Azure SQL Server (PaaS) reachable from any untrust internet source*
//RLP-98173

|Identifies Azure SQL Servers (PaaS) that are reachable from any untrust internet source on TCP port. SQL Server instances with untrusted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from untrusted IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Severity—* High

*RQL—*
----
config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'PaaS' and dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and dest.paas.service.type in ( 'MicrosoftSQLServers' )
----


|*GCP VM instance that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)*
//RLP-98679

|Identifies GCP VM instances that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). VM instances with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Severity—* High

*RQL—*
----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'GCP' and dest.resource.state = 'Active'

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS S3 bucket is not configured with MFA Delete*
//RLP-94746

|*Changes—* The policy RQL has been updated to exclude S3 buckets which are configured with `bucketLifecycleConfiguration` rules because _MFA Delete_ can't be enabled for those buckets.

*Severity—* Low

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = '(versioningConfiguration.status equals Enabled and (versioningConfiguration.mfaDeleteEnabled does not exist or versioningConfiguration.mfaDeleteEnabled equals false))'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = versioningConfiguration.status equals Enabled and (versioningConfiguration.mfaDeleteEnabled does not exist or versioningConfiguration.mfaDeleteEnabled is false) AND (bucketLifecycleConfiguration does not exist or bucketLifecycleConfiguration.rules[*].status equals Disabled)
----

*Impact—* Medium. Existing alerts for AWS S3 buckets that have bucketlifecycle configuration enabled will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior2]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION


|*Disabled Policy cannot be Re-enabled within 4 Hours*
//RLP-84484, RLP-101392

|When you disable a policy, a message to inform you that *Disabling this policy will automatically mark any open alerts as resolved. You won't be able to enable the policy back for 4 hours. Are you sure you want to continue?* is displayed. After you confirm, the policy will be disabled and that marks the start of a 4-hour window during which you cannot re-enable the policy. During this period, the button to enable the policy will be greyed out in the UI, and if you use the API to change the policy status the HTTP response will display an error.

*Impact—* The restriction will apply to all policy types and all policy severities. 

|*UEBA Anomaly Policy Attribution Extended to Support Compute Instances*
//RLP-101923, RLP-101583

|Alerts from UEBA anomaly policies were attributed to compute instances using their cloud IDs and not names. For example, an alert was attributed to an AWS EC2 instance by its ID _i-019b8f824f4f77001_ and not by its name _demo-host_. When such an alert was generated, you would not be able to click on the resource to see the Unified Asset Inventory (UAI) details and the Command Center also reported the instance by its ID instead of name.

Prisma Cloud has now added additional checks to UEBA anomaly policies to make sure alerts are attributed to a resource by its name. Now, when you click on a resource on the Alerts page, the UAI details will be displayed.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|tt:[Azure Defender for Cloud Secure Score API Ingestion]
//RLP-99600

|Prisma Cloud no longer ingests metadata for the `azure-defender-for-cloud-secure-score` API. 

In RQL, the key is not available in the `api.name` attribute auto completion.

*Impact—* If you have a saved search or custom policies based on this API, you must delete them manually.

The policy alerts will be resolved as *Policy_deleted*.

|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and port scan activity*
//RLP-96281
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for port scan activities. Port scans are a type of discovery attack where a source host is probing a target host across multiple ports, to find out what services are running and to uncover vulnerabilities associated with those services. The network connectivity with remote systems known for port scan activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and ransomware activity*
//RLP-96279
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for ransomware activities. Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to regain access. The network connectivity with remote systems known for ransomware activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION


2+|*Policy Updates-RQL*

|*Azure VM instance in running state that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port*
//RLP-96676

|*Changes—* The policy name and the RQL is updated to report instance configured with HTTP (80) and HTTP (443) port and instance which are in active state only. 

*Current Name—* Azure VM instance in running state that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) other than HTTP/HTTPS port
*Updated Name—* Azure Virtual Machine in running state that is internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)

*Updated Description—* Identifies azure VM instances in running state that are internet reachable with unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0). VM instances with unrestricted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from unknown IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.

*Severity—* High

*Current RQL—*

----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and protocol.ports in ( 'tcp/0:79', 'tcp/81:442', 'tcp/444:65535' ) and dest.resource.state = 'Active'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from network where source.network = '0.0.0.0/0' and address.match.criteria = 'full_match' and dest.resource.type = 'Instance' and dest.cloud.type = 'AZURE' and dest.resource.state = 'Active'
----

*Impact—* Medium. New alerts will be generated when instance is exposed to internet and configured where HTTP / HTTPS port.

|*GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters have Master authorized networks disabled*
//RLP-89949
|*Changes—* The policy RQL is updated to reflect the latest CSP behavior.

*Severity—* Low

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and (masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.[*] is empty or masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled equals "false")
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'gcp' AND api.name = 'gcloud-container-describe-clusters' AND json.rule = status equals RUNNING and masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig.enabled does not equal "true"
----

*Impact—* Medium. New alerts are generated for the failing resources. This includes resources where Master authorized networks were previously enabled but are now configured as disabled.

2+|*Policy Deletions*

|*GCP Policies*
//RLP-98183, RLP-98182, RLP-88162, RLP-88221
|The following policies are deleted because GCP has deprecated basic authentication, Kubernetes dashboard, and Istio for GKE.

* GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters Basic Authentication is set to Enabled
* GCP Kubernetes Engine Clusters web UI/Dashboard is set to Enabled
* GCP Kubernetes cluster istioConfig not enabled

*Impact*— Low. Previously generated alerts are resolved as *Policy_Deleted*. The out-of-the-box compliance mappings for the above policies are removed and can affect the compliance score.
