|*Addition of New IP Addresses*
//RLP-96660, TLDO-466
|Prisma Cloud has added new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/get-started-with-prisma-cloud/enable-access-prisma-cloud-console#id7cb1c15c-a2fa-4072-b074-063158eeec08_idcb6d3cd4-d1bf-450a-b0ec-41c23a4d4280[NAT IP addresses] to the existing list. Make sure to review the list and update the IP addresses in your allow lists.

|tt:[Enhancement] *Intelligent Network Graph Provides Contextual View*
//RLP-99094
|Enhancements to Prisma Cloud’s Investigate Graph provide you with a comprehensive understanding of where your assets are deployed, potential environmental vulnerabilities and their risk level, to help you determine if further investigation is warranted.

The new https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/investigate-incidents-on-prisma-cloud/investigate-network-incidents-on-prisma-cloud[Intelligent Network Graph] now provides a contextual view of cloud traffic patterns by automatically grouping assets based on parent relationships and creating a top-down hierarchy for every IP address associated with Prisma Cloud monitored assets.

Expand the graph to the level of the asset you're investigating and select *View Details* link in the sidecar to analyze specific network traffic flows.

You can also download a CSV report of the traffic flow of your entire network, a node, an instance, or a specific connection between a source and a destination node.

You can save Searches under *My Saved Searches*. Use Saved Searches to create custom policies to generate alerts when a specific pattern of network flow is detected.


|tt:[Enhancement] *Adoption Advisor Thresholds*
//RLP-91906
|The thresholds on the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/adoption-advisor[Adoption Advisor] are updated to give you a more accurate progress indicator for the following checks:

* Onboard and Configure Cloud Accounts
* Enable Audit Logs
* Enable Flow Logs
* Define Alert Rules
* Policies— Create Config Policies, Create Network Policies, and Create Audit Policies

With this enhancement, your adoption progress should better reflect the checks you're enforcing for your business needs, making it easier for you to see how well you're doing.


|tt:[Enhancement] *IsSubset method for RQL _Set function*
//RLP-98508

|The `_Set function` is enhanced to add support for the `_Set.isSubset` method that enables you to identify whether a specific value or comma separated list of values returned by the JSON path of the resource is fully contained within the target list. 

The syntax is:
----
_Set.isSubset(<path>, <targelist>) is [ true \| false ]
----

where

`<path> = JSON path`

`<target_list> = a set of strings without any whitespace.`

Example:

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name= 'aws-ec2-describe-security-groups' AND json.rule = groupName contains rql and _Set.isSubset(tags[*].key,(Name,"no_value",rql***auto)) is true
----

[#new-policies2]
=== New Policies

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Workload Protection Policies*
//RLP-93941
|For protecting hosts and containers from runtime incidents and detecting vulnerabilities on these workloads, you have 3 new out-of-the-box policies:

* Serverless Functions detected with known Vulnerabilities (Workload Vulnerability)
* Host VM Images detected with known Vulnerabilities (Workload Vulnerability)
* Apps Embedded detected with Runtime Incidents (Workload Incident)

To find these policies, select *Policies* and filter on the *Policy Type* Workload Incident and Workload Vulnerability.

[NOTE]
====
The *Apps Embedded detected with Runtime Incidents* policy will only work for GCP GCR and AWS Fargate, not AWS EKS and Azure ACI.
====


|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and unusual high volume data transfer activity*
//RLP-96286
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed, have critical or high vulnerabilities and high volume data transfer activity. The high volume data transfer could be a data exfiltration attempt. Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once they’ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities on the EC2 instance to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected EC2 instance and perform malicious actions. If network connectivity with remote systems known for high volume data transfer activity is observed on a publicly exposed and exploitable EC2 instance, it could indicate that the instance is already under attack or has been compromised. Immediate attention is required to investigate the high volume data transfer activity, remediate the critical or high vulnerabilities and restrict the public exposure reported for the EC2 instance as soon as possible.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and cryptomining domain request activity*
//RLP-96285
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for cryptomining domain request activities. Cryptomining domain request initiates suspicious DNS queries to domain names that are associated with known crypto-mining pools to generate new coins in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monero. The network connectivity with remote systems known for cryptomining domain request on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and DGA domain request activity*
//RLP-96283
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for DGA domain request activities. Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are used to generate pseudo-random domain names, typically in large numbers within the context of establishing a malicious command-and-control (C2) communications channel. The network connectivity with remote systems known for DGA domain request activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

No Policy Updates for 23.4.2.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior2]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Rate Limit Exception for GCP APIs*
//RLP-73146
|The API calls from Prisma Cloud now use quota from the onboarded GCP Projects instead of the GCP Project where the service account is created. This change enables Prisma Cloud to ingest resource metadata across multiple projects without exceeding the GCP API rate limits. 

To ensure continuous insights into all of your GCP resources and to prevent rate limit exception errors, follow the steps listed in https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-gcp/prerequisites-to-onboard-gcp#_prerequisites_to_onboard_gcp_organizations_and_projects_rate-limit-exception-for-gcp-apis[prerequisites to onboard GCP] and make sure to complete them.

[NOTE]
====
If you use the Terraform template provided by Prisma Cloud, the required permissions to the GCP service account are automatically enabled.
====

*Impact*— Not completing the tasks may result in rate limit exception errors for Prisma Cloud's authorized API calls to GCP.

|*Update for Google Compute APIs*
//RLP-47280

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for *gcloud-compute-internal-lb-backend-service* API. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-internal-lb-backend-service* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.

|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and malware activity*
//RLP-96222
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for malware activities. Malware includes viruses, trojans, worms and other types of malware that affect the popular open-source operating system. The network connectivity with remote systems known for malware activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and botnet activity*
//RLP-96219
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for botnet activities. A Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The network connectivity with remote systems known for botnet activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and cryptominer activity*
//RLP-96024
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for cryptominer activities. Cryptominer hides on computers or mobile devices to surreptitiously use the machine’s resources to mine cryptocurrencies. The network connectivity with remote systems known for cryptominer activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|*AWS EC2 instance publicly exposed with critical/high exploitable vulnerabilities and backdoor activity*
//RLP-96023
|Identifies AWS EC2 instances which are publicly exposed and have exploitable vulnerabilities that are connected with remote systems known for backdoor activities. A backdoor allows unauthorized remote access to the instances where the malware is installed while bypassing the authentication mechanisms in place. The network connectivity with remote systems known for backdoor activity on a publicly exposed and exploitable instance indicates that the instance could be under attack or already have been compromised.

*Policy Severity—* Critical.

|COMPLIANCE BENCHMARK
|DESCRIPTION


|*Support for ISO/IEC 27001:2022*

//RLP-96841
|Prisma Cloud now supports the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliance standard.

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 provides guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices, including the selection, implementation, and management of controls while taking the organization's information security risk environment into account.

With this support, you can now view this built-in standard and the related policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page. Additionally, you can generate reports for immediate viewing or download, or you can schedule recurring reports to keep track of this compliance standard over time.

[#changes-in-existing-behavior1]
=== Changes in Existing Behavior

[cols="50%a,50%a"]

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Changes to Policy Severity Level* tt:[First announced in 23.2.1]
//RLP-90803, RLP-97339

|Prisma Cloud updated the system default policies to help you identify critical alerts and address them effectively. The policy severity levels for some system default policies are re-aligned to use the newly introduced *Critical* and *Informational* severities. Due to this change, the policies have five levels of severity; Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational. You can prioritize critical alerts first and then move on to the other levels. For more information, see the updated https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/techdocs/en_US/pdf/prisma/prisma-cloud/prerelease/policy-severity-level-changes.csv[list of policies].

*Impact—* 

* Your existing open alerts associated with updated policies will have a change in their severity levels.
* If you have Alert rules set up based on the *Policy Severity* filter, there may be a decrease or increase in the number of alerts.
* The overall Compliance posture may change due to possible alert number changes.
* If you have alert rules configured for external integrations such as ServiceNow, this shift in the number of alerts may result in sending notifications for the Resolved or Open alerts.
* If you change a custom severity of a policy back to the default severity, the new severity update will apply.

[NOTE]
====
This update will not affect the severities of your custom policies or the system default policies for which you have manually changed the severities (custom severity). 
Also, if you have included a policy in at least one other alert rule `(not based on severity filter)], there will be no change in the alert numbers.
====

If you have any questions, contact your Prisma Cloud Customer Success Representative.

|*Update for Google Compute APIs*
//RLP-95461

|Prisma Cloud now provides global region support, as well as a backend update to the resource ID for *gcloud-compute-url-maps*, *gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies*, and *gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies* APIs. As a result, all resources for these APIs will be deleted and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to these resources will be resolved as Resource_Updated, and new alerts will be generated against policy violations if any.

*Impact*—You may notice a reduced alert count. However, once the resources for *gcloud-compute-url-maps*, *gcloud-compute-target-http-proxies*, and *gcloud-compute-target-https-proxies* resume ingesting data, the alert count will return to the original numbers.
