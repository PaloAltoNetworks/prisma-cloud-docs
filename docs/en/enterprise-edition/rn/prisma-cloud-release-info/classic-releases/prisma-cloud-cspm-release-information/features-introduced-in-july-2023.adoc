|DESCRIPTION


|*Integrated View of Run and Build details for Alerts*
//RLP-103734 - Moved from LGA to GA in 23.7.2
|To help you as a Cloud Security Engineer investigate issues from code to cloud, the alert details now include information to trace and attribute which build-time resource has caused a policy violation for a runtime resource deployed in your cloud account. The alert details overview includes the IaC resource details and information on the build time resource. The new Traceability information helps you connect an alert from the production environment back to the origin templates in your upstream development environment.

To view the build-time details in an alert:

* You must enable a Configuration policy with the subtype Run, Build and attach it to an alert rule on Prisma Cloud.

* Your IaC templates must be onboarded through a VCS integration.

* Terraform resources must include the *yor_trace* tag so that your IaC resources are tagged with a unique UUID for tracing the relationship between the code resource and the runtime resource that is deployed from it. This is not necessary for CloudFormation.

|*Prisma Cloud Data Security - Asset Level Scan*
//RLP-98058
|There is usually several TB or PB of data stored in your organization's S3 buckets. In order to reduce the cost associated with the scanning of a large volume of data and to provide you with more value, Prisma Cloud Data Security now provides you the option of *Asset Level Scan*. When you select this option (default) while configuring a scan, Prisma Cloud randomly scans 10% of objects or maximum of 1TB (whichever is lower) and sends the data for analysis. It stops the scan as soon as it detects an object with sensitive data and triggers a 'Storage Asset with sensitive data found' policy.

Asset Level Scan only applies when you select the Backward Scan mode and does exposure analysis and data classification and not malware scanning. It is only available when you're configuring a data security scan for your AWS cloud accounts.

[#new-policies2]
=== New Policies

No new policies for 23.7.2.

[#policy-updates2]
=== Policy Updates

[cols="50%a,50%a"]
|===
|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS Secret Manager Automatic Key Rotation is not enabled*
//RLP-104001

|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL are updated. The policy RQL is updated to exclude the secrets managed by owning services.

*Updated Description—* Identifies AWS Secret Manager that are not enabled with key rotation. As a security best practice, it is important to rotate the keys periodically so that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service is still secure with the new keys. 

NOTE: This policy does not include secret manager which are managed by some of the AWS services that store AWS Secrets Manager secrets on your behalf. 

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-secretsmanager-describe-secret' AND json.rule = rotationEnabled is false
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-secretsmanager-describe-secret' AND json.rule = rotationEnabled is false and owningService is not member of (appflow, databrew, datasync, directconnect, events, opsworks-cm, rds, sqlworkbench)
----

*Impact—* Low. Existing alerts are resolved as *Policy_Updated* for secrets managed by owning services such as appflow, databrew, datasync, directconnect, events, opsworks-cm, rds, and sqlworkbench.

|*AWS Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) with listener TLS/SSL is not configured*
//RLP-105257

|*Changes—* The policy RQL is updated to exclude the NLBs which are forwarding to ALB using TCP as a listener as per the AWS limitation.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = 'state.code contains active and ((listeners[*].protocol equals HTTPS or listeners[*].protocol equals TLS) and listeners[*].certificates[*].certificateArn does not exist) or listeners[*].protocol equals HTTP or listeners[*].protocol equals TCP or listeners[*].protocol equals UDP or listeners[*].protocol equals TCP_UDP'
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = state.code contains active and listeners[?any( protocol equals HTTP or protocol equals TCP or protocol equals UDP or protocol equals TCP_UDP )] exists as X; config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-elbv2-target-group' AND json.rule = targetType does not equal alb and protocol exists and protocol is not member of ('TLS', 'HTTPS') as Y; filter '$.X.listeners[?any( protocol equals HTTP or protocol equals UDP or protocol equals TCP_UDP )] exists or ( $.X.listeners[*].protocol equals TCP and $.X.listeners[*].defaultActions[*].targetGroupArn contains $.Y.targetGroupArn)'; show X;
----

*Impact—* Low. Alerts that are generated for NLBs which are using ALB as listener via TCP will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.


|*OCI Block Storage Block Volume does not have backup enabled*
//RLP-106008
|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL are updated. The RQL is updated to exclude the Block volumes which are attached to volume groups.

*Updated Description—* Identifies the OCI Block Storage Volumes that do not have backup enabled. It is recommended to have block volume backup policies on each block volume so that the block volume can be restored during data loss events.

Note: This Policy is not applicable for block volumes that are added to volume groups.

*Policy Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'oci' AND api.name = 'oci-block-storage-volume' AND json.rule = volumeBackupPolicyAssignment[*] size equals 0
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'oci' AND api.name = 'oci-block-storage-volume' AND json.rule = volumeBackupPolicyAssignment[*] size equals 0 and volumeGroupId equal ignore case "null"
----

*Impact—* Low. Alerts that are generated for block volumes added to volume groups will be resolved as *Policy_Updated*.

2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk*
//RLP-106430, RLP-106791

|*Changes—* The policy name and description are updated to reflect the association of this risk with S3 Buckets, providing a more accurate representation of the associated service.

*Current Policy Name—* AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk

*Updated Policy Name—* AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk associated with AWS S3 Bucket

*Updated Description—* Identifies AWS Route53 Hosted Zones which have dangling DNS records with subdomain takeover risk associated with AWS S3 Bucket. A Route53 Hosted Zone having a CNAME entry pointing to a non-existing S3 bucket will have a risk of these dangling domain entries being taken over by an attacker by creating a similar S3 bucket in any AWS account which the attacker owns / controls. Attackers can use this domain to do phishing attacks, spread malware and other illegal activities. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete dangling DNS records entry from your AWS Route 53 hosted zones.

*Policy Severity—* High

*Policy Type—* Config

*Impact—* None.

//RLP-104171
|Prisma Cloud Data Security is now available on the *app.sg* stack for all Prisma Cloud customers in Singapore. The data scans and data will remain within Singapore.


|*Least Privilege Access Enforcement*
//RLP-105018
|Streamline access management and promote secure and efficient permissions configuration with the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/cloud-identity-inventory[least privilege access] suggestions. Solve for over-privileged access issues that arise when you manage Identity Access through Groups or/and Roles rather than individual identities. You can now remediate over-permissive permissions effectively at the Group/Role level by creating new policies containing only the permissions applicable to all members. Alternatively, you can leverage existing policies by retaining only the permissions applicable to the entire Group/Role and removing any excessive permissions.

//RLP-104615
| Identifies Azure Virtual Machines that are hosted with SQL on them and have basic authentication.

Azure Virtual Machines with basic authentication could allow attackers to brute force and gain access to SQL database hosted on it, which might lead to sensitive information leakage. It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication to avoid brute force attacks on SQL database hosted virtual machines.

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is not using the latest predefined security policy*
//RLP-102409

|*Changes—* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated. The policy RQL has been updated to check for the latest security policy userinput:[ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06] 

*Updated Description—* Identifies Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. So it is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.

We recommend using ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06 policy to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.

*Severity—* Low

*Policy Type—* Config

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-elbv2-describe-load-balancers' AND json.rule = type equals application and listeners[?any(protocol equals HTTPS and sslPolicy exists and (sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2020-10 and sslPolicy does not contain ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06))] exists

----

*Impact—* Medium. New alerts will be generated in case ALB is not configured to use the latest security policy. Existing alerts for resources that are already using the latest security policy are resolved as *Policy_updated*.
