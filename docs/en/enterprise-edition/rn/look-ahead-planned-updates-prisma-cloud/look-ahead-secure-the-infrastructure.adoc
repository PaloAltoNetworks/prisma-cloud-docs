[#new-policies]
=== New Policies

Learn about the new policies and upcoming policy changes for new and existing Prisma Cloud System policies.

==== Access the Look Ahead for New Policies

To learn about the new policies that will be added in the next release:


. Find the Prisma Cloud policies folder on GitHub.
+
The folder contains RQL based Config, Network, and Audit Event policies in JSON format. https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/prisma-cloud-policies[View the GitHub repo].

. Select the branch for which you want to review policy updates.
+
The *Master* branch represents rrent Prisma Cloud release that is generally available. You can switch to a previous release or the next release branch, to review the policies that were published previously or are planned for the upcoming release.
+
Because Prisma Cloud typically has 2 releases in a month, the release naming convention in GitHub is PCS-<year>.<month>.<release-chronology, 1 or 2>. For example, PCS-24.1.1

. Review the updates.
+
Use the changelog.md file for a cumulative list of all policies that are added to a specific release. The policies are grouped by new policies and updated policies.
+
Use the *policies* folder to review the JSON for each policy that is added or updated as listed in the changelog. The filename for each policy matches the policy name listed in the changelog. Within each policy file, the JSON field names are described aptly to help you easily identify the characteristic it represents. The JSON field named searchModel.query provides the RQL for the policy.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS Elasticsearch domain publicly accessible*
//RLP-122897
|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to reduce to false positives.

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-es-describe-elasticsearch-domain' AND json.rule = processing is false and (endpoints does not exist or endpoints.vpc does not exist or endpoints.vpc is empty)
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-es-describe-elasticsearch-domain' AND json.rule = processing is false and vpcoptions.vpcid does not exist
----

*Impact—* No Impact

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium 

|*Azure Storage account is not configured with private endpoint connection*
//RLP-120048
|*Changes—* The policy RQL will be updated to report Azure storage accounts that allow all networks with the `IPrule` and `VirtualNetworkRule` not being empty. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and networkRuleSet.defaultAction equal ignore case Allow and networkRuleSet.virtualNetworkRules is empty and networkRuleSet.ipRules[*] is empty and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'azure' AND api.name = 'azure-storage-account-list' AND json.rule = properties.provisioningState equals Succeeded and networkRuleSet.defaultAction equal ignore case Allow and properties.privateEndpointConnections[*] is empty
----

*Impact—* Low. Alerts generated due to retained `IPrule` and `VirtualNetworkRule` will be triggered.

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium 

|*AWS S3 bucket publicly readable*
//RLP-104677
|*Changes—* The policy remediation steps and RQL will be updated to check for Authenticated User with read access. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = ((((publicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false)) and acl.grantsAsList[?any(grantee equals AllUsers and permission is member of (ReadAcp,Read,FullControl))] exists) or ((policyStatus.isPublic is true and ((publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false))) and (policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal equals * or Principal.AWS equals *) and (Action contains s3:* or Action contains s3:Get or Action contains s3:List) and (Condition does not exist))] exists))) and websiteConfiguration does not exist
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = ((((publicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.ignorePublicAcls is false)) and (acl.grantsAsList[?any(grantee equals AllUsers and permission is member of (ReadAcp,Read,FullControl))] exists or acl.grantsAsList[?any(grantee equals AuthenticatedUsers and permission is member of (ReadAcp,Read,FullControl))] exists)) or ((policyStatus.isPublic is true and ((publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false) or (publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false))) and (policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and (Principal equals * or Principal.AWS equals *) and (Action contains s3:* or Action contains s3:Get or Action contains s3:List) and (Condition does not exist))] exists))) and websiteConfiguration does not exist
----

*Impact—* Low. New alerts will be generated when Authenticated users have read permissions.

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* High 



2+|*Policy Updates—Metadata*

|*GCP VM instance using a default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs*
//RLP-120380
|*Changes—* The policy name, description, and recommendation steps will be updated. 

*Current Policy Name—* GCP VM instance using a default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs

*Updated Policy Name—* GCP VM instance using a default service account with Cloud Platform access scope

*Updated Description—* identifies the GCP VM instances that are using a default service account with cloud-platform access scope. To compliant with the principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation it is recommended that instances are not assigned to default service account 'Compute Engine default service account' with scope 'cloud-platform'.

*Impact—* No impact, as this is a metadata change.

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium

|tt:[Update] *Google Deployment Manager*
//RLP-123409

|*gcloud-deployment-manager-deployment-manifest*

Prisma Cloud will update the `Resource Name` and `Asset ID` fields in the backend for `gcloud-deployment-manager-deployment-manifest` API. 
Due to this change, when you perform an RQL search query, you will be able to see a change in the `Resource Name` and `Asset ID` fields making it easier for you to identify the resources. Also, all the existing resources will be deleted, and then regenerated on the management console.

Existing alerts corresponding to this resource will be resolved as `Resource_Deleted`, and new alerts will be generated against any policy violations.

*Impact—* None. Once the resources for `gcloud-deployment-manager-deployment-manifest` resume ingesting data, you will notice the correct alert count in the console.
