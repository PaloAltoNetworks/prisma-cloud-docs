Protecting your infrastructure requires visibility, so that you know what to protect and what to protect it against to prevent bad outcomes. Identifying threats, understanding the impact to your business and implementing security guardrails is essential to having a secure network. Good cloud security hygiene starts with complete visibility into the security and compliance posture of each resource deployed in your cloud environment.
