=== Description 


The use of the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable set to 0 within Dockerfiles is insecure. Setting `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=0` is a way to bypass SSL certificate verification for Python's built-in HTTP client.

When `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` is set to 0, Python's built-in HTTP client will skip SSL certificate verification when making HTTPS requests. This exposes any Python-based HTTP requests to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. In such attacks, unauthorized actors can intercept, alter, or eavesdrop on the traffic between the Python application and the server.


=== Fix - Buildtime

*Docker*

[source,dockerfile]
----
- ENV PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY=0
RUN pip install somepackage
