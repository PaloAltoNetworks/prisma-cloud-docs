=== Description 


Using `wget` with the `--no-check-certificate` option tells wget to bypass SSL certificate verification when fetching content over HTTPS.

When you use the `--no-check-certificate` option, you're telling wget to ignore validating the SSL certificate of the server it's connecting to. This makes the connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. In a MitM attack, an attacker can intercept the traffic between wget and the server, possibly altering the content or redirecting to a malicious source.


=== Fix - Buildtime

*Docker*
