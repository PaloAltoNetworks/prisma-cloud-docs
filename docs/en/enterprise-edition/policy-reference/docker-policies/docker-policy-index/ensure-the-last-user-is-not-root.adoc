=== Description 


The Docker containers by default run with the root privilege and so does the application that runs inside the container.
This is a major concern from the security perspective because hackers can gain root access to the Docker host by hacking the application running inside the container.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Dockerfile Remove `USER root` or add a non-root user after.*
