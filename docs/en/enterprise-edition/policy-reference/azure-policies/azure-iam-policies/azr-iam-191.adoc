=== Description

Azure Event Grid allows you to easily build applications with event-based architectures. It enables serverless workflows and helps apps react in real-time to all the changes happening in your Azure resources. By using Managed Identities with Event Grid Topics, you can securely authenticate the identity of the service without storing credentials in code.

This policy ensures that Managed Identity provider is enabled for Azure Event Grid Topics.
