=== Description

Azure Data Explorer (or Kusto) is a fast and scalable data analytics service that makes it simple and cost-effective to explore and analyze all of your data. To ensure secure access to other Azure services, it's best practice to use managed identities, which offer a secure, Azure AD integrated method of authenticating to Azure services.

This policy checks that the Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) clusters are configured to use managed identities for secure access.
