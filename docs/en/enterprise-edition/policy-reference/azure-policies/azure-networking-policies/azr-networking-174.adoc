*Description*

Azure API Management provides capabilities to secure your service and data. One of the first lines of defense is limiting access to the service by making it private. Allowing public access can potentially expose the service and its data to unnecessary risks. This policy ensures that public network access is disabled for Azure API Management.

=== Fix - Buildtime
