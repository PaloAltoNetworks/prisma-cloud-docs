*Description*

Using signed or trusted images ensures that the images being used in your deployments are verified and not tampered with. Enabling this feature in Azure Container Registry adds a layer of security by ensuring only signed images can be pulled and run.

This policy checks whether Azure Container Registry has trust policy enabled for signed images.
