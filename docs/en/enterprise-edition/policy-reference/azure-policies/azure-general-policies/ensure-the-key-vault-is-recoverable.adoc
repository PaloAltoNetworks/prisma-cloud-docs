=== Description 


The key vault contains object keys, secrets and certificates.
Accidental unavailability of a key vault can cause immediate data loss or loss of security functions supported by the key vault objects, such as authentication, validation, verification, and non-repudiation.
Deleting or purging a key vault leads to immediate data loss as keys encrypting data, including storage accounts, SQL databases, and/or dependent services provided by key vault objects, such as keys, secrets, and certificates.
We recommended you make the key vault recoverable by enabling the *Do Not Purge* and *Soft Delete* functions.
This will prevent accidental deletion by a user running the delete/purge command on the key vault, or an attacker/malicious user does to deliberately to cause disruption.
////
=== Fix - Runtime


* Procedure* 


There are two key vault properties that play roles in the permanent unavailability of a key vault.

. * EnablePurgeProtection*: * enableSoftDelete* only ensures that the key vault is not deleted permanently and is recoverable for 90 days from the date of deletion.
+
There are scenarios where the key vault and/or its objects are accidentally purged will not be recoverable.
+
Setting * enablePurgeProtection* to "true" ensures the key vault and its objects cannot be purged.
+
Enabling both the parameters on key vaults ensures that key vaults and their objects cannot be deleted/purged permanently.

. * SetSoftDeleteRetentionDays (Optional)*: Set the number of days that items should be retained for once soft-deleted.
+
This value can be between 7 and 90 (the default) days.


* Azure Portal The Azure Portal does not currently have provision to update the respective configurations.* 




* CLI Command* 


Use the following command:
----
az resource update
--id /subscriptions/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/
& lt;resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/& lt;keyVaultName>
--set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* azurerm_key_vault
* *Arguments:* soft_delete_enabled + purge_protection_enabled


[source,go]
----
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "example" {
        ...
+   purge_protection_enabled    = true
+   soft_delete_retention_days  = 7     # Default is 90
}
