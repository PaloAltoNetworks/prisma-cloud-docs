|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects usages of bracket notation for object access (`$OBJ[$ARG]`) in JavaScript where the argument (`$ARG`) is not a literal or number. This usage could potentially allow an attacker to access any property of the object, including its prototype, which might lead to arbitrary code execution.

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
const userProvidedKey = req.query.key;
const value = obj[userProvidedKey];
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To resolve this issue, validate and sanitize the user-provided keys before using them to access object properties.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
const userProvidedKey = sanitize(req.query.key);
const value = obj[userProvidedKey];
----

In this example, `sanitize()` is a function that ensures only safe, whitelisted keys are used for object access.
