=== Description

This policy detects code that sets the Samesite cookie attribute to either "Lax" or "None" and does not enable the secure flag. This can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
document.cookie = "session=abc; SameSite=Lax";
----

The vulnerable code example sets the Samesite attribute of the cookie to "Lax" but does not enable the secure flag. This means that the cookie can be sent over insecure HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you should set the Samesite cookie attribute to "Strict" and enable the secure flag.

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
document.cookie = "session=abc; SameSite=Strict; Secure";
----

In the secure code example, the Samesite attribute of the cookie is set to "Strict" and the secure flag is enabled. This ensures that the cookie will only be sent over secure HTTPS connections, reducing the risk of CSRF attacks.
