|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects the use of `crypto.pseudoRandomBytes` in JavaScript, which produces cryptographically weak pseudo-random numbers. This method should not be used for cryptographic purposes as it can lead to vulnerabilities.

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
const crypto = require('crypto');
const buffer = crypto.pseudoRandomBytes(256);
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To resolve this issue, use a cryptographically secure method to generate random bytes.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
const crypto = require('crypto');
const buffer = crypto.randomBytes(256);
----

In this example, `crypto.randomBytes` is used, which generates a cryptographically secure random buffer.
