=== Description

This policy identifies the use of cryptographic hash functions against inputs like passwords without employing a salt. Employing hashes without a salt can make systems vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as rainbow table attacks.

Common functions this policy checks for include:
- `crypto.pbkdf2Sync`
- `crypto.scrypt`
- `crypto.scryptSync`

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hashedPassword = crypto.pbkdf2Sync('userPassword', 'fixedIV', 10000, 64, 'sha512');
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, always use a unique salt with cryptographic hash functions. Salting helps in preventing attackers from using precomputed tables to look up the hash values.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
const crypto = require('crypto');
const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
const hashedPassword = crypto.pbkdf2Sync('userPassword', salt, 10000, 64, 'sha512');
----

In the corrected example, a unique salt is generated and then utilized in the hashing function, ensuring the resulting hash is unique and more secure.
