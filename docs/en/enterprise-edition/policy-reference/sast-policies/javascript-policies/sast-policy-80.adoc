=== Description

Amazon S3 is a widely used object storage service. By default, S3 buckets can be accessed using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Although HTTPS encrypts the transmission, HTTP does not, leaving the data vulnerable to interception, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Using HTTPS ensures that the data is encrypted during transit, safeguarding against potential interceptions and offering a more secure method for data transfer.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const myBucket = new s3.Bucket(stack, 'MyBucket');
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

Always ensure that S3 buckets are accessed exclusively via HTTPS. This can be enforced by setting the `enforceSSL` property to `true` during the S3 bucket creation.

Secure code example:

[source,javascript]
----
const myBucket = new s3.Bucket(stack, 'MyBucket', {
  enforceSSL: true
});
----

By enforcing HTTPS for your S3 buckets, you significantly enhance the security of your data during transit.
