=== Description

This SAST policy detects when user inputs are not sanitized properly before being displayed in a web page, which may potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, this policy targets cases when special characters are not properly neutralized in Javascript. Some problematic code examples are using `prompt()`, `document.getElementById()`, `document.getElementsByClassName()`, and `document.querySelector()` without sanitization.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,Javascript]
----
document.getElementById('user-input').innerHTML = req.body.userInput;
----

In the above code `req.body.userInput` is a user input that is directly inserted into the web page through `innerHTML` without any sanitization. If a user inserts a malicious script as input, it will lead to an XSS attack.

=== Fix - Buildtime

Use a sanitizer. Sanitizers will neutralize special characters that could be interpreted as scripting elements. Libraries like 'sanitize-html', 'xss-filters' and 'dompurify' have methods to sanitize HTML inputs.

Secure code example:

[source,Javascript]
----
var sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');
document.getElementById('user-input').innerHTML = sanitizeHtml(req.body.userInput);
----

The 'sanitize-html' method encodes special characters that have significant meanings in HTML so they cannot be interpreted as scripting elements. This way, even if the user provides a malicious script as input, it will not result in an XSS attack.
