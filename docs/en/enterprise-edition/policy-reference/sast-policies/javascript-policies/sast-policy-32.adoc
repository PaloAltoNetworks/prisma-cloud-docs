=== Description

This policy detects insecure temporary file creation in JavaScript. Temporary files created without secure permissions can lead to vulnerabilities like unauthorized file access or sensitive information disclosure.

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('tempfile.txt', 'some data');
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, always specify secure file permissions when creating temporary files. Use options like `constants.S_IRUSR | constants.S_IWUSR` to set file mode securely.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
const fs = require('fs');
const constants = require('constants');

fs.writeFileSync('tempfile.txt', 'some data', {
  mode: constants.S_IRUSR | constants.S_IWUSR,
});
----

In this example, secure options are used for file creation, providing read and write permissions only for the owner.
