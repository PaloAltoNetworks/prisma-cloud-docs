|=== 

=== Description

This policy identifies instances in JavaScript where the `new Buffer()` constructor is used with non-literal values. Such usage can lead to potential memory leaks. The `new Buffer()` constructor is considered unsafe when used with non-literal arguments, and it's recommended to use safer alternatives such as `Buffer.from()` or `Buffer.alloc()`.

For more information about the risks and deprecation of the `new Buffer()` constructor, refer to the https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/buffer-constructor-deprecation/[Node.js documentation], the https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660[Node.js GitHub issue], and the https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-security/blob/main/rules/detect-new-buffer.js[ESLint Community Plugin].

Example of violating code:

[source,javascript]
----
let userSize = getUserInput();  // Potentially unsafe user input
let buffer = new Buffer(userSize);
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To mitigate this issue, replace the use of the `new Buffer()` constructor with safer alternatives. Preferably use `Buffer.from()` or `Buffer.alloc()` based on your specific requirements.

Example of corrected code:

[source,javascript]
----
let userSize = getUserInput();
let buffer = Buffer.alloc(parseInt(userSize, 10));
----

In the corrected example, the safer `Buffer.alloc()` method is utilized, ensuring controlled memory allocation and reducing potential risks.
