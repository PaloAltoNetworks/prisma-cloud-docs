=== Description

Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is an attack strategy that can exploit poorly crafted regular expressions to execute a denial of service (DoS) on a server. Particularly, some regex patterns are vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking situations, making them a potential target for such attacks.

Examples of bad practices include:

1. General bad practice, e.g. - `(\w+\s?)*$`
2. Nested quantifiers, e.g. - `(\d+)+`
3. Multiple overlapping patterns, e.g. - `(a|aa)+`
4. Grouping with repeating backreferences inside patterns with quantifiers.
5. Evil regex pattern, e.g. - `(a+)*`

To protect against ReDoS attacks:

1. **Never use user input directly:** Always sanitize and validate user inputs before using them in regular expressions.
2. **Use Libraries:** Utilize libraries or functions that escape regex metacharacters and sequences. This helps to ensure the regex is processed safely.
3. **Server-Side Validation:** Always validate and sanitize on the server side, not on the client-side frontend.
4. **Use Non-Backtracking Engines:** Consider using non-backtracking regex engines, such as Google's re2, to handle complex regex operations.

=== Fix - Buildtime

Here's how to safeguard against ReDoS attacks:

1. **Sanitize User Input:** Ensure user input is sanitized or validated before being used in regular expressions.
2. **Avoid Catastrophic Backtracking:** Craft regular expressions that do not lead to catastrophic backtracking situations.
3. **Escape Metacharacters:** Utilize libraries or functions that escape regex metacharacters and sequences.
4. **Server-Side Over Client-Side:** Always sanitize and validate on the server side and not on the client-side frontend.
5. **Alternative Regex Engines:** Use non-backtracking regex engines like Google's re2.

By following these best practices, you can ensure a more secure and robust application that's safeguarded against potential ReDoS attacks.
