=== Description

This SAST policy detects the use of the RSA algorithm without incorporating Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), making the algorithm vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/NoPadding");
----

The above code is vulnerable because it uses the RSA algorithm without enabling padding. Without padding, the algorithm is susceptible to chosen plaintext attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, you should enable OAEP mode by passing "RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding" to the `Cipher.getInstance` method.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it incorporates OAEP padding, which provides additional security and protects against chosen plaintext attacks.
