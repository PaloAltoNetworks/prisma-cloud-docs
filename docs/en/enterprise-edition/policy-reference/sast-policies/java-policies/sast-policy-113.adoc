=== Description

This policy detects improper control of generation of code ('Code Injection') vulnerabilities in Java code. It identifies instances where user input is passed directly to the `eval` method of a `ScriptEngine`, which may execute OS commands and lead to code injection attacks.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
import javax.script.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("javascript");
        
        String userInput = "1+1";
        engine.eval(userInput); // Vulnerable code
    }
}
----

The above code is vulnerable because it takes user input (`userInput`) and directly passes it to the `eval` method of the `ScriptEngine`, without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could provide malicious input, such as `userInput = "1; OS.execute('rm -rf /');"`, causing the `eval` method to execute arbitrary OS commands.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, it is recommended to avoid using user input directly in the `eval` method of a `ScriptEngine`. Instead, you should use more secure alternatives such as hardcoded JavaScript, lookup tables, or `javax.script.Bindings`.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
import javax.script.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("javascript");
        
        String userInput = "1+1";
        engine.eval("var x = " + userInput + ";"); // Secure code
    }
}
----

In the secure code example, the user input (`userInput`) is first concatenated with a pre-defined JavaScript code (`"var x = "`) to form a valid JavaScript expression. This ensures that the user input is treated as a variable assignment and not as direct code execution. Thus, the vulnerability is mitigated as the injected code will not be executed.
