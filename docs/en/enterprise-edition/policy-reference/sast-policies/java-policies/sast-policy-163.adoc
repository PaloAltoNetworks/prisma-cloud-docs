=== Description

This policy detects cases where XSLT translation is performed with potentially malicious input, which can lead to Injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the policy looks for the use of `new FileInputStream()` or `getClass().getResourceAsStream()` methods to read files, in combination with XSLT transformation methods like `newTransformer()` or `transform()`. 

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(userSuppliedFile);
TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
Transformer transformer = tf.newTransformer(userSuppliedXSL);
transformer.transform(xmlSource, result);
----

The above code is vulnerable because it reads a file (`userSuppliedFile`) using `FileInputStream`, which can allow an attacker to inject a path to a sensitive file on the server. The `userSuppliedXSL` is then used in XSLT transformation, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary XSL functions or perform XML entity attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, it is recommended to avoid processing user-supplied XSL style sheets. If XSLT processing is absolutely necessary, ensure that the `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature is enabled prior to processing the XSLT.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
InputStream xslInput = new ByteArrayInputStream(userSuppliedXSL.getBytes());
TransformerFactory tf = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
tf.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
Transformer transformer = tf.newTransformer(new StreamSource(xslInput));
transformer.transform(xmlSource, result);
----

The secure code example avoids processing user-supplied XSL style sheets directly. Instead, it creates an `InputStream` from the `userSuppliedXSL` and enables the `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature on the `TransformerFactory` to ensure secure processing of the XSLT. This mitigates the risk of XSLT injection and XML entity attacks.
