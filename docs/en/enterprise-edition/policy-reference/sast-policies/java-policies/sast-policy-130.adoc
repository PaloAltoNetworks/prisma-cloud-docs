=== Description

This policy detects when an application is generating an RSA key with encryption strength less than the recommended 2048 bits. The use of RSA keys with inadequate encryption strength can leave the application vulnerable to attacks and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
keyPairGenerator.initialize(1024, new SecureRandom());
----

The above code is vulnerable because it generates an RSA key with encryption strength of 1024 bits, which is less than the recommended 2048 bits. This encryption strength is no longer considered secure and can be easily compromised by attackers.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, the encryption strength of the RSA key should be increased to at least 2048 bits.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
keyPairGenerator.initialize(2048, new SecureRandom());
----

The above secure code increases the encryption strength of the RSA key to 2048 bits. This ensures that the key is more secure and less susceptible to attacks.
