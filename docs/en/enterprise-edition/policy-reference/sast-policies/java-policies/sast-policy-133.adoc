=== Description

This policy detects an incorrect behavior order where input validation is performed after the Unicode normalization process. This can be a security vulnerability as an attacker may try to exploit the normalization process.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
String input = request.getParameter("input");
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("pattern");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
String normalizedInput = Normalizer.normalize(input, Normalizer.Form.NFC);
----
In the above code example, the input is first used in a regular expression pattern match and then the `Normalizer.normalize` function is called to perform Unicode normalization. However, the validation of the input occurs after the normalization process, which can allow attackers to manipulate the input and bypass the validation.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, the Unicode normalization should be performed before any validation of the input.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
String input = request.getParameter("input");
String normalizedInput = Normalizer.normalize(input, Normalizer.Form.NFC);
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("pattern");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(normalizedInput);
----
In the secure code example, the input is first normalized using `Normalizer.normalize` function before being used in the regular expression pattern match. This ensures that the input is validated based on the normalized version, preventing potential exploitations of the normalization process.
