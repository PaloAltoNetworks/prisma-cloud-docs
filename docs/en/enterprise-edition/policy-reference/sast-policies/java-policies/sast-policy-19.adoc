=== Description


The policy addresses the issue of creating and setting cookies without the Secure flag. The Secure flag is a directive for the browser, indicating that the cookie should only be sent over secure (HTTPS) connections. If the Secure flag is not set, the cookie may be sent over insecure (HTTP) connections, potentially exposing sensitive information in an environment vulnerable to eavesdropping.

A violating code example could be:

[source,java]
----
import javax.servlet.http.Cookie;

public class CookieCreator {
    public void createCookie(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response) {
        Cookie myCookie = new Cookie("name", "value");
        // The cookie is being created without the Secure flag.
        response.addCookie(myCookie);
    }
}
----

In the above code, a new cookie is being created and added to the HTTP response without setting the Secure flag, thus violating the policy.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, you should set the Secure flag when creating a new cookie, as in the following example:

[source,java]
----
import javax.servlet.http.Cookie;

public class CookieCreator {
    public void createCookie(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response) {
        Cookie myCookie = new Cookie("name", "value");
        myCookie.setSecure(true); // Setting the Secure flag.
        response.addCookie(myCookie);
    }
}
----

By setting the Secure flag with `myCookie.setSecure(true)`, we ensure that the cookie will only be sent over secure connections, preventing exposure of potentially sensitive information over insecure connections.
