=== Description

This policy detects when the Apache Commons Mail client is used without enabling TLS server identity validation. Without server identity validation, there is a risk that an attacker in between the application and the target host could intercept sensitive information or transmit malicious data.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
Email email = new HtmlEmail();
email.setSSLOnConnect(true);
email.send();
----

In the above code, the `setSSLOnConnect(true)` method enables TLS for the email connection, but the `setSSLCheckServerIdentity(true)` method is not called to validate the server's identity. This leaves the application vulnerable to "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, you need to enable server identity validation by calling the `setSSLCheckServerIdentity(true)` method on the email object. 

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
Email email = new HtmlEmail();
email.setSSLOnConnect(true);
email.setSSLCheckServerIdentity(true);
email.send();
----

In the secure code, the `setSSLCheckServerIdentity(true)` method is called, which ensures that the server's identity is validated before sending the email. This mitigates the risk of interception or data tampering by an attacker.
