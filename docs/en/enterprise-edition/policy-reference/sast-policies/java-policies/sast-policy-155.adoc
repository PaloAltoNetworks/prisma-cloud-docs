=== Description

This policy detects the use of insufficiently random values, which can expose cryptographic functions to be exploitable. It recommends using the `SecureRandom` class's `DRBG` instance when generating numbers for sensitive values such as tokens, nonces, and cryptographic keys.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
Random rand = new Random();
int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(100);
----

The above code is vulnerable because it uses the `Random` class from Java's standard library to generate random numbers. The `Random` class uses a linear congruential formula to generate pseudo-random numbers, which can be predictable and easy to guess. This weak randomness can compromise the security of cryptographic functions and make them susceptible to attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, it is recommended to use the `SecureRandom` class's `DRBG` (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) instance. 

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
SecureRandom rand = new SecureRandom();
int randomNumber = rand.nextInt(100);
----

The above code is no longer vulnerable because it uses the `SecureRandom` class, which provides a higher level of randomness by utilizing a cryptographic algorithm to generate random numbers. This improves the security of cryptographic functions that rely on these numbers and makes them less susceptible to attacks.
