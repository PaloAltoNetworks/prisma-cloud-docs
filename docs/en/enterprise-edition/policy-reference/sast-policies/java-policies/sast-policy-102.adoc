=== Description

This policy detects the usage of HTTP (instead of HTTPS) for transmitting sensitive information, which can lead to the leakage of sensitive data.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,java]
----
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;

...

HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
DataOutputStream outputStream = new DataOutputStream(connection.getOutputStream());

// Sending sensitive data over HTTP
----

The above code is vulnerable because it establishes an HTTP connection (`HttpURLConnection`) and sends sensitive data over the network in plain text using `DataOutputStream`.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the issue, you should use an HTTPS connection instead of an HTTP connection to ensure secure transmission of sensitive information.

Secure code example:

[source,java]
----
import java.net.HttpsURLConnection;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;

...

HttpsURLConnection connection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
DataOutputStream outputStream = new DataOutputStream(connection.getOutputStream());

// Sending sensitive data over HTTPS
----

In the secure code example, we have replaced `HttpURLConnection` with `HttpsURLConnection` to establish an HTTPS connection. This ensures that the sensitive data is transmitted encrypted and secure over the network.
