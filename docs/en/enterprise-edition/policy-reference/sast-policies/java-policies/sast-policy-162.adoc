=== Description

This SAST policy detects a potential vulnerability related to a permissive cross-domain policy with untrusted domains. The issue arises when the application allows user-supplied input into the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. This header is part of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) specification and controls which domains can communicate with the server. By allowing user input to specify the allowed domains, an attacker could exploit a weakness in the server to force clients to send credentials (such as session identifiers) to the attacker's server. 

To successfully execute such an attack, the application would need to suffer from an additional vulnerability, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 

Vulnerable code example:

[source, java]
----
String userOrigin = request.getParameter("origin");
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", userOrigin);
----

In the above code, the value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is taken directly from the user-supplied `origin` parameter without any validation or sanitization. This allows any domain specified by the user to be set as an allowed origin, potentially enabling cross-site scripting attacks.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, the application should not use user-supplied information when calling `setHeader` or `addHeader` for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header's value. Instead, the allowed domain(s) should be hardcoded and referenced in a lookup.

Secure code example:

[source, java]
----
response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "https://example.com");
----

In the secure version of the code, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is set to a specific trusted domain (`https://example.com` in this example), eliminating the use of user-supplied input. This prevents an attacker from manipulating the allowed domains and reduces the risk of potential security vulnerabilities.
