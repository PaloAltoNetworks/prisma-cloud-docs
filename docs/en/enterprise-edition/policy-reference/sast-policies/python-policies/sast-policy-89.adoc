=== Description

This policy detects potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Python code where the HTTP response contains user-provided code.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
user_input = request.GET.get('input')
return HttpResponse(user_input)
----

The vulnerable code above takes user input from the `request.GET` object and returns it in the HTTP response without proper sanitization or output encoding. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the response and potentially execute it when other users visit the page.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix the vulnerability, you should properly sanitize and encode the user input before returning it in the HTTP response. This can be done using functions or libraries that provide output encoding, such as `escape()` or `html.escape()`.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
import html

user_input = request.GET.get('input')
sanitized_input = html.escape(user_input)
return HttpResponse(sanitized_input)
----
