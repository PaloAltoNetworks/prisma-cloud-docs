=== Description 

The `exec()` function in Python is a built-in function that is used to execute dynamically created program, which can be a string or object code. Using `exec()` can make your code susceptible to a number of security risks:

1. Code Injection: The most significant risk with `exec()` is that it can execute arbitrary code. This opens up the possibility for an attacker to inject malicious code into your program.

2. Debugging: Debugging issues can become difficult because the behaviour of `exec()` can depend on the runtime environment and the exact input being executed.

3. Performance: The `exec()` function is slow as it needs to parse and compile the code each time it's called.

Here's an example of code that might trigger this warning:

[source,python]
----
command = input("Enter a command: ")
exec(command)
----

In this example, an attacker could input Python code that deletes files, accesses sensitive data, or makes network requests.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix it, it's often possible to replace the use of `exec()` with other techniques. If you're using `exec()` to call functions, you can replace it with a dictionary of functions. If you're using it for expressions, you might be able to use `eval()` (but be aware that `eval()` has its own security implications and should also be used very carefully).

For example, if you want to call a function based on a string, you can do it like this:

[source,python]
----
def func1():
    print("Function 1 was called")

def func2():
    print("Function 2 was called")

functions = {"func1": func1, "func2": func2}

command = input("Enter a command: ")

if command in functions:
    functions[command]()
----

This way, the program only allows specific, pre-determined commands, which reduces the risk of arbitrary code execution.
