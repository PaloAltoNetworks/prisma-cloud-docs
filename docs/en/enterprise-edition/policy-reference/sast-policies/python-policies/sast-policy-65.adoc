=== Description

Encryption is a critical component in securing data in transit. However, not all encryption mechanisms are created equal. Over time, encryption algorithms and protocols can become vulnerable due to various reasons like advances in computing power and cryptographic attacks. As such, old and insecure protocols should be abandoned in favor of more secure ones.

This policy identifies the use of deprecated or weak SSL/TLS versions in your Python codebase. Specifically, SSL versions and early versions of TLS (up to TLS 1.1) are no longer considered secure and should not be used in modern applications.

For instance:

[source,python]
----
import ssl
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3)  # Vulnerable due to use of SSLv3
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

Adopt best practices in encryption to ensure your application's security:

1. Do not use SSL protocols; they are outdated and have known vulnerabilities.
2. Avoid using TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, as they are considered weak and are deprecated.
3. Upgrade to using TLS version 1.2 or higher, which provides strong encryption and is widely supported.
4. Regularly review and update your encryption protocols and libraries.

The recommended way to initialize an SSL context is:

[source,python]
----
import ssl
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)  # Use TLSv1.2 or higher
----

By ensuring the use of strong and updated encryption protocols, you reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and data breaches, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your data.
