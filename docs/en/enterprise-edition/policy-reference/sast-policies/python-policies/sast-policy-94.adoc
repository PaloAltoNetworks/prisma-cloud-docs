|=== 

=== Description

This SAST policy detects instances where improper certificate validation is being performed in Python code. Improper certificate validation can lead to sensitive information being transmitted in clear text, which can expose it to unauthorized access.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
requests.get(url, verify=False)
----

In the above code, the `verify=False` parameter is used when making a request with the `requests` library. This disables the verification of SSL certificates, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks and exposing sensitive information.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you should enable SSL certificate verification when making requests. This can be done by removing the `verify=False` parameter or setting it to `True`.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
requests.get(url, verify=True)
----

By setting `verify=True`, the SSL certificate will be validated, ensuring secure communication and preventing sensitive data exposure.
