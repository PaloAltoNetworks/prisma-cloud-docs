=== Description

This SAST policy detects improper restriction of XML external entity reference vulnerabilities in Python code that uses the native XML libraries. 

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('file.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
----
                
The above code is vulnerable because it uses the `ET.parse()` method from the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module without proper restriction of XML external entities. This can allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, it is recommended to use the `defusedxml` library instead of the native Python XML libraries. The `defusedxml` library is specifically designed to mitigate XML external entity attacks.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
import defusedxml.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('file.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
----
