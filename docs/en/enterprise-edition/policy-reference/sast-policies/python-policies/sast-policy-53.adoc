=== Description

Setting the `HttpOnly` flag for cookies is crucial for security. This flag ensures that cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript, preventing potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks from stealing cookies. This policy detects scenarios where cookies are set without the `HttpOnly` flag, which makes them vulnerable to theft or manipulation.

Example of a potentially vulnerable code:

[source,python]
----
response = flask.Response()
# ... other code ...
response.set_cookie('session', 'value123')
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To secure cookies always set the `HttpOnly` flag when setting cookies. This restricts cookies from being accessed via JavaScript.

Example of a secure approach:

[source,python]
----
response = flask.Response()
# ... other code ...
response.set_cookie('session', 'value123', httponly=True)
----

By following this guideline, you safeguard your cookies from potential theft or manipulation by malicious scripts.
