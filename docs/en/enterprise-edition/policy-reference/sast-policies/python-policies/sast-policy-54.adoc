=== Description

A potential vulnerability has been identified where JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are being decoded or processed without proper verification of their signatures. JWTs are a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Ensuring the signature of a JWT is verified is critical for the integrity and authenticity of the token.

When JWTs are not verified, it can lead to:

1. Unauthorized actions.
2. Data breaches.
3. Spoofed identities.
4. Exploitation of other security vulnerabilities.

In the provided codebase, JWTs are being processed using methods that explicitly disable verification or do not verify the JWT's signature before decoding its content. This is a severe security misconfiguration that can lead to potential security risks and breaches.

For example, avoid practices such as:

[source,python]
----
# Vulnerable way of decoding JWT without verification
decoded_jwt = jwt.decode(token, verify=False)
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To address this:

1. Always verify the JWT's signature before decoding or processing its content.
2. Avoid using configurations that disable signature verification.
3. Regularly review and update libraries or methods that deal with JWTs to ensure they follow best security practices.

For example:

[source,python]
----
# Correct way to decode a JWT with verification
decoded_jwt = jwt.decode(token, key, algorithms=["HS256"])
----

Always ensure you are providing the correct secret or public key and specifying the algorithms you trust for decoding to prevent potential attacks.
