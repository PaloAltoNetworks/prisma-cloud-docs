|=== 

=== Description

This policy detects the use of the wildcard character in a system call that spawns a shell. When a wildcard is used in a system call, it is subject to normal shell expansion, which can have unintended consequences if there exist any non-standard file names.

Vulnerable code example:

[source,python]
----
import os

command = "ls " + user_input + "/*.txt"
os.system(command)
----

In the above code, the user input is directly concatenated with a command to list all files with a .txt extension using the wildcard character *. This code is vulnerable because the user can provide a malicious input that contains special characters or parameters that can manipulate the shell behavior.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you should properly sanitize and validate the user input before using it in any system call. Use strict input validation to ensure that the user-provided input does not contain any special characters or malicious parameters.

Secure code example:

[source,python]
----
import os
import re

user_input = input("Enter a directory: ")
if re.match("^[a-zA-Z0-9/]*$", user_input):
    command = "ls " + user_input + "/*.txt"
    os.system(command)
else:
    print("Invalid directory input.")
----

In the secure code example, the user input is validated using a regular expression that allows only alphanumeric characters and slashes (/). If the input passes the validation, it is safe to use in the system call. Otherwise, an error message is displayed indicating invalid directory input.

By properly validating the user input, the wildcard character is no longer vulnerable to shell expansion and unintended consequences.
