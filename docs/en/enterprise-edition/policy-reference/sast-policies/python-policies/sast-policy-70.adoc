=== Description

The `urllib` module in Python provides a way to work with URLs. However, when used improperly, it can introduce security vulnerabilities, especially when handling URLs that may be controlled or manipulated by malicious actors.

Our analysis has detected the use of `urllib` or its variants with dynamic values. The problem with this is that `urllib` inherently supports the `file://` scheme. This means a malicious actor can craft URLs that could potentially allow them to read arbitrary files on the server. This behavior exposes the system to a range of security threats, including information disclosure.

For example:

[source,python]
----
# Vulnerable code snippet
import urllib

url = get_dynamic_value_from_user()
content = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
----

=== Fix - Buildtime

To address this vulnerability:

1. Audit the uses of `urllib` or related calls to ensure no user data can influence or control the URLs being accessed.
2. Consider avoiding the use of `urllib` for URLs that might be influenced by user data. Instead, prefer using the more robust `requests` library in Python.
3. If you continue using `urllib`, ensure proper validation and sanitization mechanisms are in place to prevent malicious URL crafting.

A safer approach:

[source,python]
----
# Recommended code snippet
import requests

url = get_dynamic_value_from_user()
response = requests.get(url)
content = response.text
----

Being vigilant about the libraries and functions you use and ensuring you are always following best practices can go a long way in maintaining the security and integrity of your applications.
