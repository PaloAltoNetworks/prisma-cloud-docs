=== Description

The warning is about the use of encryption keys that are too small. According to guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), RSA and DSA keys should be 2048 bits or larger. Smaller keys are considered to be weak and can be broken with sufficient computational power, which could potentially allow an attacker to decrypt your data or impersonate your users.

Here's an example of violating code:

[source,python]
----
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa

private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=1024  # This key size is too small.
)
----

In this code, the key size of 1024 is smaller than the recommended minimum of 2048, which makes the key weak.

=== Fix - Buildtime

To fix this issue, you simply need to use a larger key size when generating your keys:

[source,python]
----
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa

private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=2048  # This key size is sufficiently large.
)
----

In this revised code, the key size is 2048, which meets the NIST recommendations for key size.
