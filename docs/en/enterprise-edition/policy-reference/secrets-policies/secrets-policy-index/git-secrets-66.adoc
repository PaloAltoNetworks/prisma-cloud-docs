=== Description 


Splunk's Credential Management page enables storing credentials for scripted or modular inputs.
Input configurations that reference credentials can use the credentials stored in Credential Management.
Developers can store credentials such as usernames and passwords, or certificates used for authentication with third-party systems.
It is discouraged to use this page to manage certificates used to encrypt server-to-server communications.
