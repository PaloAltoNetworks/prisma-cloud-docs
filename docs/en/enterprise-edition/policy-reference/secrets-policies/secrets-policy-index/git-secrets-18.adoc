=== Description 


Twilio Access Tokens are short-lived tokens that you can use to authenticate Twilio Client SDKs like Voice, Conversations, Sync, and Video.
You create them on your server to verify a client's identity and grant access to client API features.
All tokens have a limited lifetime, configurable up to 24 hours.
However, a best practice is to generate Access Tokens for the shortest amount of time feasible for your application.

.  Revoke the exposed secret.

The following method deletes an API Key.
+
This revokes its authorization to authenticate to the REST API and invalidates all Access Tokens generated using its secret.
+
If the delete is successful, Twilio will return an HTTP 204 response with no body.
