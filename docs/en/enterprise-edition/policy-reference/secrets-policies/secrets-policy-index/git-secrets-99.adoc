=== Description

A NuGet API Key is a token that grants authentication for publishing packages or for interacting with the NuGet gallery in other ways, such as managing package owners. It is used with the NuGet API in the .NET ecosystem and is associated with a specific NuGet account. The API key must be kept confidential because it allows significant access to your NuGet account and resources.

To revoke a NuGet API Key, you can follow these steps:

1. Log into your NuGet account on the NuGet Gallery website.
2. Click on your username at the top right of the page, and then click on 'API Keys' in the dropdown menu.
3. Find the key you want to revoke from the list of keys.
4. Click on 'Delete' next to the key you want to revoke.
5. You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the key. Confirm the action, and the key will be revoked.

Once you revoke a key, it can't be used anymore to authenticate with the NuGet API.
