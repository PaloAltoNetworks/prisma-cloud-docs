=== Description 

No authentication method is configured for the Jenkins instance. Anyone with network access to the instance has full control over the instance without being required to authenticate, allowing anonymous attackers to edit and execute jobs, modify settings, and administer the system.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Implement a secure authentication mechanism which provides security controls that meet industry best practices, such as integrating with the organizationâ€™s SSO solution.
