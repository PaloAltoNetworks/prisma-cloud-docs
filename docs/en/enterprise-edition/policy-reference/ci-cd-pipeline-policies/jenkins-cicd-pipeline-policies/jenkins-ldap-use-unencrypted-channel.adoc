=== Description 

The LDAP protocol is used in the Jenkins instance for the authentication of users. This instance is communicating with the remote LDAP server over an unencrypted channel. This allows attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept the LDAP traffic, which may lead to bypassing the authentication mechanism and gaining control over the Jenkins instance.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Encrypt all LDAP data in transit flowing to and from the Jenkins instance, by using the secure LDAPS protocol.
