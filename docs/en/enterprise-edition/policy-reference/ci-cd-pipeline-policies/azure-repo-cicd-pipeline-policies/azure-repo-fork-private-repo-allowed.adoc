=== Description

Forking is allowed on private repositories, enabling user accounts with ‘read’ permissions only to fork a repository to another project or user account.
This could allow sensitive code to be inadvertently/intentionally leaked. 
Additionally, pull requests can be created from the forked repository to the original repository, which could potentially lead to the execution of malicious code on the CI, even by users with read-only permissions on the original repository.


=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Whenever not required, disable the forking of private repositories.
To restrict forking of a private repository in Azure Repos:
. In *Project Settings*, select *Repositories* in the left navigation.
. Select the *Repositories* tab, choose a repository > *Settings* > set *Forks* to *OFF*.
