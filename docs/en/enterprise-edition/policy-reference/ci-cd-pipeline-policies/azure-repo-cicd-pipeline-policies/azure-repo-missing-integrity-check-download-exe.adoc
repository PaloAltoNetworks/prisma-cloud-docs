=== Description

Executables are downloaded and executed during a pipeline run without being validated for integrity, a check which verifies the executable’s content. An attacker who compromises the executable can execute code in the pipeline that can exfiltrate credentials or affect the build process in order to ship malicious code or artifacts to production.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Follow the vendor’s instructions on how to validate the signature of the downloaded executable.
