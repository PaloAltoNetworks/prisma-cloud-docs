=== Description

In common *package.json* configurations, the `npm install` command updates and installs package versions.
'npm install' does not check for package integrity, allowing attackers who have gained control of a dependency package to upload a malicious version, which is then downloaded and installed automatically when running 'npm install'.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Use the `npm ci` command instead of `npm install` to install NPM packages. 'npm ci' installs exact dependency versions and checksums according to the package-lock.json file. If package names or versions in the 'package-lock.json' file do not match those in the 'package.json' file, 'npm ci' will not install the packages.
