=== Description

SSL Verification is disabled for a project service hook, which instructs Azure Repos to not verify the identity of the remote server.

The lack of verification enables attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and to expose the transmitted data.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

[.task]

[.procedure]

To enable SSL Verification for a service hook:
. In Azure Repos, browse to *Project Settings*.
. Under *Service hooks*, select the relevant webhook.
. Uncheck the *â€œ*Accept untrusted SSL certificates* setting.
