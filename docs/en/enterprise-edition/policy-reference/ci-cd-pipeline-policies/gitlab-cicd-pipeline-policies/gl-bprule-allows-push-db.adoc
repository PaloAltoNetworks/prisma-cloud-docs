=== Description 

A user with write permissions can push malicious code to the default branch of an actively used repository^*^, without having to go through an approval cycle.
This code is likely to flow through the pipeline to production systems.

^*^An actively used repository is defined as having at least two contributors, over 50 commits, and has been updated in the last 90 days.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

We recommend preventing unreviewed push of code:
 
. Open the default branch settings editor: Select the projectâ€™s **Repository Settings** > **Protected Branches**.
. Select **No One** in the **Allowed to Push** field.
