=== Description 

Pipeline commands transmitting data over an unencrypted layer such as HTTP allow attackers to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept, tamper with and/or steal information, to possibly run code in the build system and to reach the production environment.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Use a secure protocol such as HTTPS which encrypts communication between clients and servers, in order to transmit data through pipeline commands.
