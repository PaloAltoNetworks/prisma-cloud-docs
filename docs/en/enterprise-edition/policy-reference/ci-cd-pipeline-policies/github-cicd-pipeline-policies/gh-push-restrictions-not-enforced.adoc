=== Description 

An actively used repository^*^ does not enforce restrictions limiting the users permitted to push or merge code to the default branch.

Enforcing push restrictions adds another protection layer to sensitive branches that are connected to CI/CD processes defending them against attacks such as PPE (Poisoned Pipeline Execution) and other missing flow control mechanisms. By restricting write permissions to a branch pattern, only a select group is allowed to make changes to the branch.

A use case example may be a mono repository that many people need to have write access to but only specific teams need push access to specific branches.

* An actively used repository has at least two contributors, over 50 commits, and has been updated in the last 90 days.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

It is recommended to configure push restrictions to minimize the users that are able to push to sensitive branches:

. In GitHub, browse to the repository *Settings* > select *Branches*.
. Ensure or add a branch protection rule on the desired branch.
. Under *Protect matching branches*, check *Restrict who can push to matching branches*. 
. Add people, teams and apps that should have push access to branches matching the rule pattern.
