=== Description 

Including secrets in a webhook URL comes with risks:

* Applications and actors with access to the webhook URL will have access to the secret
* Third party systems logging webhook URLs could gain access to the secrets included in the URL
* When part of an unencrypted HTTP request, a webhook URL exposes the secret to anyone with access to the traffic such as cache servers and firewalls
* Placing secrets in a webhook URL makes it more difficult to rotate them 

An attacker could use these secrets to gain unauthorized access to services that are used to authenticate the webhook against. 

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

To secure your webhook recipientâ€™s service from unauthorized access, remove secrets from webhook URLs, and use alternative
methods to authenticate against 3rd party systems.

For example, you can use a GitHub secret token in the webhook mechanism by including it in the request header. This ensures that the secret is not exposed in the URL.
