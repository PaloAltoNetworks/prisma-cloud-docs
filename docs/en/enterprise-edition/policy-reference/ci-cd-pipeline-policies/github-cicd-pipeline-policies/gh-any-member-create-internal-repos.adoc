=== Description 

All members of an organization have privileges to create private repositories. If a member's account or access token is compromised, a malicious actor could create such a repository and access all of the organization's secrets scoped to private and internal repositories.
For example, if the scope of a GitHub organization secret is not limited to specific repositories, any member of the organization can create a private repository and configure a GitHub Actions workflow to retrieve the secret.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Disable the excessive permissions granted to all organization members to create private repositories.

To disable internal repository creation refer to https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization.

If the above mitigation is not possible, or in addition to it, it's important to scope organization secrets to specific repositories and grant permission on a need-to-access basis only, following the principle of least privileges.

To change the scope of a GitHub organization secret: 

. Browse to the *Settings* tab of your GitHub organization's repository where the secret is located.
. Click on the *Secrets* menu located in the left-hand side of the page.
. Select the required secret and click on its name to open the details page.
. Click on the *Edit* button on the top right-hand corner of the page.
. Under *Repository access*, select the repositories that should have access to the secret.
. Click on the *Update secret* button to save the changes.
