=== Description 

The `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` environment variable is set to *True* in the GitHub Actions workflow. 

This setting, since deprecated by GitHub, allows the workflow to evaluate the `set-env` and `add-path` commands once they have been written to the standard output stream. This can lead to command execution in the workflow.

For example, a workflow that prints the title of new GitHub issues to the standard output stream would allow an attacker to create a GitHub issue with a malicious title that would be evaluated by the workflow.
+
NOTE: Although this setting was deprecated by GitHub, it is still functional.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Disable the use of unsecure commands in GitHub Actions workflows in one of the following two manners: 

* Set the `ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS` environment variable to *‘*False*’*.

* Delete the environment variable.
+
NOTE: By default, deleting the environment variable sets the environment variable to *False*.
