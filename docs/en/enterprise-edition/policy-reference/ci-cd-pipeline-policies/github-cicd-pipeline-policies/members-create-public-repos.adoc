=== Description 

Organization members are allowed to create public repositories. This can lead to internal code being inadvertently exposed publicly, being accessible to external users.

=== Recommended Solution - Buildtime

Restrict organization members from creating public repositories.
To apply the restriction, follow the instructions on the GitHub documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization
