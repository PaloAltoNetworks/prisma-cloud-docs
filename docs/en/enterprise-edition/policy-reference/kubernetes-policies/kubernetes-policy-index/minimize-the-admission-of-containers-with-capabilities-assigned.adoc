=== Description 


Docker has a default list of capabilities that are allowed for each container of a pod.
The containers use the capabilities from this default list, but pod manifest authors can alter it by requesting additional capabilities, or dropping some of the default capabilities.
Limiting the admission of containers with capabilities ensures that only a small number of containers have extended capabilities outside the default range.
This helps ensure that if a container becomes compromised it is unable to provide a productive path for an attacker to move laterally to other containers in the pod.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* Container
* *Arguments:* securityContext:capabilities:drop (Optional)

Capabilities field allows granting certain privileges to a process without granting all the privileges of the root user.
when *drop* includes *ALL*, all of the root privileges are disabled for that container.
