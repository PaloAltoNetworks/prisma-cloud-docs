Default Kubernetes service accounts are actively used by bounding to a role or cluster role


=== Description 


Every Kubernetes installation has a service account called _default_ that is associated with every running pod.
Similarly, to enable pods to make calls to the internal API Server endpoint, there is a *ClusterIP* service called _Kubernetes_.
This combination makes it possible for internal processes to call the API endpoint.
We recommend that users create their own user-managed service accounts and grant the appropriate roles to each service account.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 




*Option 1* 


* *Resource:* ServiceAccount
* *Arguments:* If service name is set to default, *automountServiceAccountToken* should be set to false in order to opt out of automounting API credentials for a service account.


[source,default service]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: default
+ automountServiceAccountToken: false
----

[source,non-default service]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
+ name: <service name>
----

*Option 2* 


* *Resource:* RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding
* *Arguments:*  *RoleBinding* grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users within a specific namespace.
*ClusterRoleBinding* grants that access cluster-wide. To avoid activating  the default service account, it should not be used as a subject in *RoleBinding* or *ClusterRoleBinding* resources.


[source,RoleBinding]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <name>
subjects:
-- kind: ServiceAccount
-  name: default

[source,ClusterRoleBinding]
