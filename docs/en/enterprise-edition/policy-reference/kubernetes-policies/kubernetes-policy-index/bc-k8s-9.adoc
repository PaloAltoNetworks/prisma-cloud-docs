=== Description 


When specifying the resource request for containers in a pod, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the pod on.
When setting resource limit for a container, the kubelet enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set.
If a container is created in a namespace that has a default CPU limit, and the container does not specify its own CPU limit, then the container is assigned the default CPU limit.
Kubernetes assigns a default CPU request under certain conditions.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Kubernetes* 


* *Resource:* Container
* *Arguments:* resources:requests:cpu (Optional)
