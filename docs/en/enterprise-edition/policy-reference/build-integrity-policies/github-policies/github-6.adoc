=== Description 

Requiring signed commits on GitHub is a security practice that ensures every commit is signed with a GPG or S/MIME signature, verifying the identity of the commit author and ensuring that the commit hasn't been tampered with after it was signed. This policy ensures that branch protection rules enforce a requirement for signed commits.

When branch protection rules are configured to require signed commits, it prevents unverified commits from being pushed to the protected branches, thus safeguarding the codebase against unauthorized modifications.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

To comply with this policy, you must enable the requirement for signed commits in your GitHub branch protection rules.

[source,hcl]
----
resource "github_branch_protection" "example" {
  repository_id      = github_repository.example.node_id
  pattern            = "main"

  # Enforce all commits to be signed
+ require_signed_commits = true

  # ... other branch protection settings ...
}
----

By setting the `require_signed_commits` attribute to `true`, you enforce that all commits to the protected branch must be signed, thus upholding the integrity and authenticity of your codebase.
