=== Description 

Pull request approvals are a critical part of the GitHub workflow, serving as a quality control measure to ensure code is reviewed and vetted before it is merged. Requiring at least two approvals for a pull request before merging can enhance the security and integrity of the code by ensuring that at least two separate individuals have reviewed the changes.

This policy checks that GitHub branch protection rules require at least two approvals on pull requests, which helps prevent unreviewed code from being merged into protected branches.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Terraform*

Ensure your GitHub branch protection rules specify that at least 2 approvals are required before a pull request can be merged.

[source,hcl]
----
resource "github_branch_protection" "example" {
  repository_id      = github_repository.example.node_id
  pattern            = "main"

  required_pull_request_reviews {
+   required_approving_review_count = 2
    # ... other configurations ...
  }

  # ... other branch protection settings ...
}
----

Adjust the `required_approving_review_count` to `2` or more to comply with this policy. This change enforces that at least two separate approvals are required, thus implementing a two-person review process for any changes to the code base.
