=== Description 


The use of multiple trigger rules in a CI configuration file can lead to duplicate pipelines running.
For example, if there is a trigger for every push and a trigger for merge request events, both triggers could be true and thus create two pipelines.


*Example Fix*

Try to keep the number of trigger sources down to one.
