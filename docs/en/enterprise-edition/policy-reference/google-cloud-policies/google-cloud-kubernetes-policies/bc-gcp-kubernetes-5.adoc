=== Description 


Node *auto-upgrade* keeps nodes up-to-date with the latest cluster master version when your master is updated on your behalf.
When a new cluster or node pool is created, node *auto-upgrade* is enabled as default.
We recommend you ensure *auto-upgrade* is enabled.
Automatic node upgrade ensures that when new binaries are released you instantly get a fix with the latest security issues resolved.
GKE will automatically ensure that security updates are applied and kept up to date.
