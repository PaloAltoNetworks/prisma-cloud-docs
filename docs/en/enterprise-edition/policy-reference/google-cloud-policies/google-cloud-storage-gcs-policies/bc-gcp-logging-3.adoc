=== Description 


A check to ensure that the specified logging bucket is not itself.
A bucket must not log access to itself, logging requires a second separate bucket.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* google_storage_bucket This check will trigger if you attempt to self reference:


[source,go]
----
resource "google_storage_bucket" "mylovelybucket" {
  name     = "mylovelybucket"
  location = var.location
  uniform_bucket_level_access = true
  logging {
    log_bucket = "mylovelybucket"
    }
}
