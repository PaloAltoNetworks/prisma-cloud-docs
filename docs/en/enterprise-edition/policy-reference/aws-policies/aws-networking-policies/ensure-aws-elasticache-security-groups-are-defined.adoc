=== Description

By ensuring that AWS Elasticache security groups are defined, you can help protect your clusters from unauthorized access and ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed to reach your clusters.
This can help prevent data breaches and other security incidents, and can also help ensure that your clusters are not overwhelmed by unwanted traffic.
