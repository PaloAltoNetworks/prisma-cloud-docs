=== Description 


Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service for building and running applications that work with connected datasets.
Neptune supports graph query languages such as Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and W3C's SPARQL.
Neptune also supports recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security.
Encryption of Neptune storage protects data and metadata against unauthorized access.
It also fulfils compliance requirements for data-at-rest encryption of production file systems.
Encryption for an existing database cannot be added or changed after it is created.
