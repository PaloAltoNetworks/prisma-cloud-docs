=== Description 

In Amazon ECS, it's important to distinguish between the execution task roles as they fulfill separate roles and serve distinct purposes:

* The *execution role* is used by the ECS agent to make AWS API calls on behalf of the user.
* The *task role* grants permissions specifically to the tasks.

If the same role is used for both purposes, it might lead to a broader set of permissions than required. For example, the execution role might end up with unnecessary task-specific permissions, or the task role might have permissions that are not relevant to the execution role.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:* aws_ecs_task_definition
* *Arguments:*  execution_role_arn, task_role_arn

Ensure that the `execution_role_arn` does not match the `task_role_arn`
