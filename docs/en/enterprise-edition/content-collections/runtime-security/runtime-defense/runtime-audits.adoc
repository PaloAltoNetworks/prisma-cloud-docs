== Runtime Audits

This document summarizes all the runtime audits (detections) that are available in Prisma Cloud Compute. For each detection, you can learn more about what it actually detects, how to enable or disable it, avoid false positives, relevant workloads (Containers, Hosts, Serverless and App-embedded), and if the audit also generates an incident.
