== Suspicious Binary

A suspicious binary incident indicates that a suspicious binary was written to the file system.
The binary is either incompatible with the system architecture or the ELF header was manipulated to hinder analysis.
These indicators are common signs of malware.

=== Investigation

The first indicator of a suspicious binary would be that the binary is incompatible with the system architecture.

Attackers use automated tools frequently to download multiple binaries of different architectures when the target architecture is not known.
Process _curl_ downloading an ARM binary, for example, strongly indicates a breach had taken place.

The following incident shows that the process _curl_ downloaded the ELF file _/dropbear-arm-32_, which is incompatible with the system architecture.

The second indicator of a suspicious binary would be ELF headers with non-typical content.
This indicates that the binary might have been compiled by attacking tools or otherwise hindered to avoid detection.

The following incident shows that the ELF file _upx_ was written to the file system and is suspected as malicious.
Its ELF header indicates using anti-analysis techniques to modify the file.

When triggered in a container, the suspicious binary incident indicates an attacker has access to writing or modifying files in the container and might have gained full code execution in the container.

Therefore, for investigating this incident you must first determine the source of the file write call.
The process that called the file write is likely malicious.

You should further investigate how this process gained execution.
Review the forensics date for the container/host, other entries in the Incident Explorer, and audits from the source, looking for unusual process execution, hijacked processes, and explicit execution of commands.


=== Mitigation

A full mitigation strategy for this incident begins by resolving the issues that allowed the attacker to write or modify the file.

Ensure that compliance benchmarks are appropriately applied to the affected resources.
For example, if the critical file systems in the host are mounted read-only, it will be more difficult for an attacker to change system files and configurations to their advantage.
