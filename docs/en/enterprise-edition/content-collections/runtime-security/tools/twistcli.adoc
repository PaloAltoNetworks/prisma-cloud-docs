== twistcli

Prisma Cloud ships a command-line configuration and control tool known as _twistcli_.
It is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

=== Installing twistcli

The _twistcli_ tool is delivered with every Prisma Cloud release.
It is statically compiled, so it does not have any external dependencies, and it can run on any Linux host.
No special installation is required.
To run it, simply copy it to a host, and give it executable permissions.
You need `sudo` privileges to run the `twistcli` command.

The _twistcli_ tool is available from the following sources.

* You can download _twistcli_ from the Prisma Cloud Console UI.
Go to *Manage > System > Utilities*.
+
image::runtime-security/twistcli-download.png[width=600]
+
Choose the correct architecture and OS when downloading the `twistcli` command-line utility.

* You can download it from the API, which is a typical use case for automated workflows.
For more information, see the `/api/v1/util` endpoint.

The requirements for running _twistcli_ are:

* The host running _twistcli_ must be able to connect to the Prisma Cloud Console over the network.
* For image scanning, Docker Engine must be installed on the executing machine.


=== Connectivity to Console

Most _twistcli_ functions require connectivity to Console.
All example commands specify a variable called COMPUTE_CONSOLE, which represents the address for your Console.

To get the address for your Console, go to *Runtime Security > Manage > System > Utilities*, and copy the string under *Path to Console*.

=== Functions

The _twistcli_ tool supports the following functions:

* _console_ --
Installs and uninstalls Console into a cluster.
Kubernetes and OpenShift are supported.
You can also export Kubernetes or OpenShift deployment files in YAML format.

* _defender_ --
Installs and uninstalls Defender into a cluster.
Kubernetes and OpenShift are supported.
Defender is installed as a daemon set (Kubernetes, OpenShift) which means one Defender is always automatically deployed to each node in the cluster.
You can also export a Kubernetes or OpenShift deployment file in YAML format.

* _hosts_ --
Scans hosts for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
+
// twistcli hosts scan support for Windows:
// https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/14992

* _images_ --
Scans container images for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
Because it runs from the command line, you can easily integrate Prisma Cloud’s scanning capabilities into your CI/CD pipeline.

* _intelligence_ --
Retrieves the latest threat data from the Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream, and push those updates to a Prisma Cloud installation running in an air-gapped environment.

* _tas_ --
Scans VMware Tanzu droplets.

* _app-embedded_ --
Embed the App Embedded Defender into a Dockerfile.

* _restore_ --
Restore Console to the state stored in the specified backup file.
An automated backup system (enabled by default) creates and maintains daily, weekly, and monthly backups.
Additional backups can be made at any point in time from the Console UI.

* _serverless_ --
Scans serverless functions for vulnerabilities.

* _support_ --
Streamlines the process of collecting and sending debug information to Prisma Cloud's support team.
Collects log data from a node and uploads it to Prisma Cloud's support area.

Prisma Cloud doesn't support deployment to macOS hosts, so there is no support for scanning macOS hosts.

^2^
Scans Linux images on macOS hosts.
Docker for Mac must be installed.

^3^
Twistcli can scan Windows images on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019 hosts.
To scan Linux images on Windows, install https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/[Docker Machine on Windows] with the Microsoft Hyper-V driver.
Twistcli does not support scanning Linux images on Windows hosts with https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/[Docker for Windows].

^4^
The _support dump_ function collects Console's logs when Console malfunctions.
Copy _twistcli_ to host where Console runs, then execute _twistcli support dump_.
Defender logs can be retrieved directly from the Console UI under *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.


^5^
IaC scanning is only available with *Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition*.

Stand-alone refers to installing an instance of Console or Defender onto a single host that isn't part of a cluster.
For stand-alone installations of Console, use the _twistlock.sh_ script to install Onebox.

The _twistcli console install_ command for Kubernetes and OpenShift combines two steps into a single command to simplify how Console is deployed.
This command internally generates a YAML configuration file and then creates Console's resources with _kubectl create_ in a single shot.
This command is only supported on Linux.
Use it when you don't need a copy of the YAML configuration file.
Otherwise, use _twistcli console export_.
