== VM Image Scanning

Prisma Cloud can scan the virtual machine (VM) images in your cloud environment for the following types of vulnerabilities:

* *Host configuration*: Vulnerabilities in the VM image setup.

* *Docker daemon configuration*: Vulnerabilities that stem from misconfiguring your Docker daemon. The Docker daemon derives its configuration from various files, including `/etc/sysconfig/docker` or `/etc/default/docker`.

* *Docker daemon configuration files*: Vulnerabilities that arise from setting incorrect permissions on critical configuration files.

* *Docker security operations*: Recommendations and reminders for extending your current security best practices to include containers.

* *Linux configuration*: Compliance of Linux hosts. For example, ensure mounting of the `hfs` filesystem is disabled.
