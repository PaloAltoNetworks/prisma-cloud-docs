== Email Alerts

Prisma Cloud can send email alerts when your policies are violated.
Audits in *Monitor > Events* are the result of a policy violation.
Prisma Cloud can be configured to notify the appropriate party by email when an entire policy, or even specific rules, are violated.

NOTE: Because Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Compute Console is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, outbound connections to port 25 from Console are blocked.
All other ports are available, including ports 587 and 465.
For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail[here].

=== Configure the channel

[.procedure]
. In *SMTP address*, specify the hostname for your outgoing email server.

. In *Port*, specify the port for email submissions.

. In *Credential*, create the credentials required to access the email account that sends alerts.
This isn't a required field.

.. Select *Add new*.

.. Select *Basic authentication*.

.. Enter a username and password.

. If you are using SMTPS, where the SMTP connection is encrypted when established, set *SSL* to *On*.

NOTE: To support email alerts for SMTP connections encrypted using the `STARTTLS` command, disable *SSL*.

. Set up your recipients.

.. Select *Add recipient*, and enter an email address.
Every email alert profile must have at least one recipient, even if you're using alert labels.

.. (Optional) Specify recipients using xref:../audit/annotate-audits.adoc[alert labels].

. Select *Next*.

. Review the *Summary* and test the configuration by selecting *Send test alert*.

. Select *Save*.

=== Troubleshooting

==== Unable to test Email Alerts for 'smtp.office365.com' on port 587.

*Error*: `tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake`

image::runtime-security/email-alert-failed-handshake.png[width=200]

Prisma Cloud fails to send test alerts to 'smtp.office365.com' on port 587 after enabling *SSL*.

*Cause*:

In the SMTP protocol that Prisma Cloud Console uses to send Email Alerts, there is a following standard flow in which the client (Prisma Cloud Console) requests the server to convert an existing plain-text connection to an encrypted connection:

* The client (in this case the PCC console) sends the message “EHLO” to the server (e.g. smtp.office365.com).
* The server responds with available extensions, one of which is “STARTTLS“.
* The client responds with “STARTTLS“.
* The server acknowledges receiving the “STARTTLS”.
* The client issues a TLS handshake with the server.
* Once the handshake is successful, all communication with the server from here on is encrypted.

We support using 'STARTTLS' to encrypt Email Alerts sent over SMTP if the mail server supports it.
With 'smtp.office365.com' and 'smtp-legacy.office365.com' using port 587, 'STARTTLS' is used, which encrypts subsequent communication even without 'SSL' toggle being enabled.

[.procedure]

. Configure the alert profile settings with the SMTP address on same port '587' with *SSL* disabled.
