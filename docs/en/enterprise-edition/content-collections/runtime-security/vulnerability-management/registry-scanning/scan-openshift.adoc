== Scan Images in OpenShift Integrated Docker Registry

To scan an OpenShift integrated registry, create a new registry scan setting.

[.task]
=== Create a new registry scan

*Prerequisites:*

* xref:../../install/deploy-defender/defender-types.adoc[Install a Defender] and make sure that the defender can access the OpenShift registry.

* Use the `twistlock-service` service account to authenticate to the internal registry. The Defender authenticates to the OpenShift registry using this service account.
** Add the cluster role permission of registry-viewer to the `twistlock-service` account.
+
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user registry-viewer system:serviceaccount:<twistlock_project>:twistlock-service
----
** Obtain the password for the twistlock-service account.
*** To get the secret used by the service account run the command - `oc describe sa twistlock-service -n <twistlock_project>`.
*** Use the *Image pull secrets* value (`twistlock-service-dockercfg-64jtt`) in the following command, for example:
+
----
oc get secret twistlock-service-dockercfg-64jtt -n twistlock --output=json|grep openshift.io/token-secret.value
----
*** Copy the openshift.io/token-secret.value to be used later in the workflow.
*** If you use the OpenShift UI to obtain the token, select *view-all* to see the full token.

* Place the CA certificate (`ca.cert`) file in any of the following paths. As soon as the certificate is found in a path, the search stops and doesn't go the next path.
+
`/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
+
`/etc/containers/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
+
`/etc/containerd/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
* Set up OpenShift credentials with basic authentication in xref:../../authentication/credentials-store/credentials-store.adoc[Credentials store] and grant Prisma Cloud access to your repository in OpenShift.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, then go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registry settings*.

. Select *Add registry*.

. In *Version*, select *Red Hat OpenShift*.

. In *Registry*, enter the registry address.
+
The internal address to access the OpenShift registry is `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000`.

. In *Repository* , specify the repository to scan.
+
If you leave this field blank or enter a wildcard, Prisma Cloud finds and scans all repositories in the registry.
+
If you specify a partial string that ends with a wildcard, Prisma Cloud finds and scans all repositories that start with the partial string.
+
If you specify an exact match, Prisma Cloud scans just the specified repository.

. Enter *Tag* numbers to scan, leave blank, or enter a wildcard (*) to scan all the tags.

. Optionally, enter *Tags to exclude*, to avoid scanning images with specified tags.

. In *Credential*, select OpenShift credentials that you created in the prerequisites section.
+
In *Password*, enter your service account token.

. In *OS type*, specify whether the repo holds *Linux* or *Windows* images.

. In *Scanners scope*, specify the collections of defenders to use for the scan.
+
Console selects the available Defenders from the scope to execute the scan job according to the *Number of scanners* setting.
For more information, see xref:../../vulnerability-management/registry-scanning/configure-registry-scanning.adoc#deployment-patterns[deployment patterns].

. In *Number of scanners*, enter the number of Defenders across which scan jobs can be distributed.

. Set *Cap* to the number of most recent images to scan.
Leaving *Cap* set to *5* will scan the 5 most recent images.
Setting this field to *0* will scan all images.

. Select *Add*.

. Select *Save and scan*.
Verify that the images in the repository are being scanned under *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registries*.

=== Troubleshooting

[.task]
==== x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

[.procedure]
. Check if the defender can access the OpenShift registry.

. Make sure that you have installed the `ca.cert` file in any one of the following locations:
+
`/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
+
`/etc/containers/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
+
`/etc/containerd/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
