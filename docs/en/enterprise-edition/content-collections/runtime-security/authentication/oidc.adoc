== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Open ID Connect

OpenID Connect is a standard that extends OAuth 2.0 to add an identity layer.
Prisma Cloud supports integration with any standard Open ID Connect (OIDC) provider that implements both OpenID connect core and OpenID connect discovery.
Prisma Cloud supports the authorization code flow only.

This page includes instructions to integrate with the following providers:

* <<pingone,PingOne>>
* <<okta,Okta>>
* <<azure-ad,Azure Active Directory>>

Use the *\https://<CONSOLE>:<PORT>/api/v1/authenticate/callback/oidc* URL only to configure the integration between services.
The API is not included in https://pan.dev/compute/api/[our reference guide] because the URL is only enabled as a configuration value.

[#pingone]
=== PingOne

Integrate with PingOne.

You need to configure Compute as an OIDC app.
When configuring your app:

* The Start SSO URL must point to the *\https://<CONSOLE>:<PORT>/callback* URL.
* The Redirect URI must point to the *\https://<CONSOLE>:<PORT>/api/v1/authenticate/callback/oidc* URL.
* UserInfo must include `sub`, `idpid`, and `name`.
* All of the following scopes must be included for OpenID.

** OpenID Connect (openid)
** OpenID profile
** OpenID Email
** OpenID address
** OpenID Phone
** Groups

[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud to OIDC user identity mapping

If you intend to use the group mapping method, skip to the <<group-mapping,Prisma Cloud to OIDC provider group mapping>> task.
Create a user for every user that should access Prisma Cloud.
The Open ID Connect specification requires every username to match with a configured username in the Prisma Cloud database.
Prisma Cloud uses attributes that come from OIDC to perform this match, for example you can use `sub`, `username` or `email`.
You should use whichever value the provider is configured to send to Prisma Cloud when you configure users.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add User*.

. Set *Username* to the GitHub user name.

. Set *Auth method* to *OpenID Connect*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user-roles.adoc[role] for the user.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OpenID Connect*, and then click *Login*.
+
image::runtime-security/oidc-login.png[width=250]

.. You're redirected to your OIDC provider to authenticate.

.. After successfully authenticating, you're logged into Prisma Cloud Console.

[#group-mapping]
[.task]
=== Prisma Cloud to OIDC provider group mapping

When you use groups to assign roles in Prisma Cloud you don't have to create individual Prisma Cloud accounts for each user.
The group value configured on the Compute side should reflect the name of the group scope in the OIDC provider.
It might be something different than groups.

Groups can be associated and authenticated with by multiple identity providers.
If you use Azure Active Directory (AAD), a user can't be part of more than 200 groups at once.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

. Click *Add Group*.

. In *Name*, enter an OpenShift group name. For AAD use Azure Group's *Object ID* as the group name.

. In *Authentication method*, select *External Providers*.

. In *Authentication Providers*, select *OpenID Connect group*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user-roles.adoc[role] for the members of the group.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OpenID Connect*, and then click *Login*.
+
image::runtime-security/oidc-login.png[width=250]

.. You're redirected to your OIDC provider to authenticate.

.. After successfully authenticating, you're logged into Prisma Cloud Console.
