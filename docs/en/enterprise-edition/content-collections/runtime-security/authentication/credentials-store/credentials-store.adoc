== Credentials Store

Your container environments can use many third party services across multiple cloud providers.
To improve accessibility and reusability, Prisma Cloud manages all credentials in a central encrypted store.
Prisma Cloud uses these credentials for the following integrations.

* Scanning container registries, serverless functions, and others.
* Alerting in third party services such as email, Slack, ServiceNow, and others.
* Deploying and managing Defender DaemonSets from the Prisma Cloud Console UI.
* Injecting secrets from secret stores into containers at runtime.

The following diagram shows the architecture of the the credentials store.

To access the credential store, go to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.
If credentials are in use, you can't delete them.
To see where credentials are used, click on an entry in the credentials store table, and review the *Usages* list.

To refresh a credential's values, you don't need to delete and set up the integration again.
If an integration uses a credential, and you edit its parameters, for example the username or password, etc.
Prisma Cloud propagates the new values automatically to the right places in the product.
