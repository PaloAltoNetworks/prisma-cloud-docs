== Integrate with Okta via SAML 2.0 federation

Many organizations use SAML to authenticate users for web services.
Prisma Cloud supports the SAML 2.0 federation protocol to access the Prisma Cloud Console.
When SAML support is enabled, administrators can log into Console with their federated credentials.
This article provides detailed steps for federating your Prisma Cloud Console with Okta.

The Prisma Cloud/Okta SAML federation flow works as follows:

. Users browse to Prisma Cloud Console.

. Their browsers are redirected to the Okta SAML 2.0 endpoint.

. They enter their credentials to authenticate.
Multi-factor authentication can be enforced at this step.

. A SAML token is returned to Prisma Cloud Console.

. Prisma Cloud Console validates the SAML token’s signature and associates the user to their Prisma Cloud account via user identity mapping or group membership.

Integrating Prisma Cloud with SAML consists of setting up your IdP, then configuring Prisma Cloud to integrate with it.

. In the *App name* field, enter *Prisma Cloud Console*, then click *Next*.

. In the SAML Settings dialog:

.. In the *Single Sign On URL* field, enter *\https://<CONSOLE_ADDR>:8083/api/v1/authenticate*.
+
Note that if you have changed the default port you use for the HTTPS listener, you'd need to adjust the URL here accordingly.
Additionally, this URL must be visible from the Okta environment, so if you're in a virtual network or behind a load balancer, it must be configured to forward traffic to this port and it's address is what should be used here.

.. Select *Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL*.

.. In the field for *Audience Restriction*, enter *twistlock* (all lowercase).

.. Expand *Advanced Settings*.

.. Verify that *Response* is set to *Signed*.

.. Verify that *Assertion Signature* is set to *Signed*.

. (Optional) Add a group.
+
Setting up groups is optional.
If you set up group attribute statements, then permission to access Prisma Cloud is assessed at the group level.
If you don't set up group attribute statements, them permission to access Prisma Cloud is assessed at the user level.

.. Scroll down to the *GROUP ATTRIBUTE STATEMENTS* section.

.. In the *Name* field, enter *groups*.

.. In filter drop down menu, select *Regex* and enter a regular expression that captures all the groups defined in Okta that  you want to use for access control rules in Prisma Cloud.
+
In this example, the regular expression **.{asterisk}(t|T)wistlock.{asterisk}** is used to include all groups prepended with either Prisma Cloud or twistlock.
You should enter your own desired group name here.
If you have just one group, such as YourGroup, then just enter *YourGroup*.
Regular expressions are not required.
If you have multiple groups, you can use a regular expressions, such as *(group1|group2|group3)*.
+

+
You are directed to a summary page for your new app.

. Click on the *People* tab, and add users to the Prisma Cloud app.

. Click on the *Groups* tab, and add groups to the Prisma Cloud app.

. Click on the *Sign On* tab and click *View setup instructions*.

[.task]
=== Configuring Console

Configure Prisma Cloud Console.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and login as admin.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Identity Providers > SAML*.

. Set *Integrate SAML users and groups with Prisma Cloud* to *Enabled*.

. Set *Identity provider* to *Okta*.

. Copy the following values from Okta and paste them into their corresponding fields in Console:
+
* Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL
* Identity Provider Issuer
* X.509 Certificate

. In *Audience*, enter *twistlock*.

. Click *Save*.


[.task]
=== Granting access by group

Grant access to Prisma Cloud Console by group.
Each group must be assigned a xref:../authentication/user-roles.adoc[role].
You can optionally use these groups to define xref:../access-control/rbac.adoc[RBAC rules] for controlling who can run which Docker Engine commands in your environment.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Define a SAML group.

.. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

.. Click *Add group*.

.. In the *Name* field, enter a group name.
+
The group name must exactly match the group name in the SAML IdP.
Console does not verify if that the value entered matches a group name in the SAML IdP.

.. Select the *SAML group* checkbox.

.. Select a role.

.. Select a project(s) - Optional.

.. Click *Save*.


[.task]
=== Granting access by user

Grant access to Prisma Cloud Console by user.
Each user must be assigned a xref:../authentication/user-roles.adoc[role].
You can optionally use these user to define xref:../access-control/rbac.adoc[RBAC rules] for controlling who can run which Docker Engine commands in your environment.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Define a SAML user.

.. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

.. Click *Add user*.

.. In the *Username* field, enter a user name.
+
The username must exactly match the username in the SAML IdP.
Console does not verify if that the value entered matches a user name in the SAML IdP.

.. Select *SAML* as the Auth method

.. Select a role.
