== Onboard Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Accounts for Agentless Scanning

Agentless scanning lets you inspect the risks and vulnerabilities of a virtual machine without having to install an agent or affecting the execution of the instance. Prisma Cloud gives you the flexibility to choose between agentless and agent-based security using Defenders. Currently, Prisma Cloud supports agentless scanning on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for vulnerabilities and compliance. To learn more about how agentless scanning works, see the xref:../agentless-scanning.adoc[How Agentless Scanning Works?][How Agentless Scanning Works?]

This guide enables Agentless scanning for Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition (PCEE, SaaS) in OCI.

The procedure shows you how to complete the following tasks.

. Create an OCI compartment to run the needed instances in OCI that perform the agentless scanning.

. Create a new OCI user for Prisma Cloud to access OCI.

. Create an API key in OCI for the new user.

. Configure the Prisma Cloud console to access the OCI resources.

. Apply the needed permissions in OCI.

. Start an agentless scan.
