== AWS Secrets Manager

You can integrate Prisma Cloud with AWS Secrets Manager.
First, configure Prisma Cloud to access AWS Secrets Manager, then create rules to inject the relevant secrets into the relevant containers.


*Prerequisites:*

* The service account Prisma Cloud uses to access the secrets store must have the following permissions:
** secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
** secretsmanager:ListSecrets
* You have https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html[created a secret] in AWS Secrets Manager.
Automatic rotation must be disabled.
Prisma Cloud supports the key-value secret type only.
When storing a new secret, select *Other type of secrets*, then *Secret key/value*.
