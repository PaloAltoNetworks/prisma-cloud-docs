== Syslog and Stdout Integration

You can configure Prisma Cloud to send audit event records (audits) to syslog and/or stdout for Console and Defender based on whether you have Prisma Cloud Compute Edition or Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition.

For the Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition, we operate and monitor the Console for you. Therefore, the Console does not generate syslog events that you can reference.

The Defenders generate syslog messages that you can ingest for runtime and firewall events. In addition, you can configure Prisma Cloud to append a custom string to all Defender syslog messages.

[.task]
=== Sending syslog messages to a network endpoint

Writing to _/dev/log_ sends logs to the local host's syslog daemon.
The syslog daemon can then be optionally configured to forward those logs to a remote syslog or SIEM server.
If you don't have access to the underlying host, you can configure Prisma Cloud Console to send log messages directly to your remote system.

[NOTE]
====
In most cases, you won't need to specify a network endpoint in order to send syslog messages to your SIEM tool.
If you already have log collectors on your hosts, simply enable syslog.
Your log collectors will stream Prisma Cloud syslog messages to your SIEM tool.
====

Some things to keep in mind:

* Console sends logs directly to your remote server.
When configuring Console with the remote server, validate that the address you enter is actually reachable from the host where Console runs.
Otherwise, you risk losing log messages.

* Because Console sends messages directly to your remote server, and not through the local syslog daemon, you don't get some of syslog's built-in benefits, such as buffering, which protects against network outages and service failures.

* The classic syslog implementation sends logs over UDP.
This is considered a bad practice if your logs have any value.
UDP is connectionless.
Packets are sent to their destination without confirming that they were received.
TCP's stateful connections and retransmission capabilities make it more appropriate for shuttling logs to a SIEM.

[.procedure]
. Log into Console.

. Go to *Manage > Alerts > Logging*.

. Set *Syslog* to *Enabled*.

. In *Send syslog messages over the network to*, click *Edit*, and then specify a destination.


[.task]
=== Appending custom strings to syslog messages

You can configure Prisma Cloud Compute to append a custom string to all Defender syslog messages.

Custom strings are set in the event message as a key-value pair, where the key is "id", and the value is your custom string.
The following screenshot shows a Defender event, where the custom string is "koko".

image::runtime-security/defender-syslog-event-with-custom-string.png[width=800]

Configuring a custom string is useful when you have multiple Prisma Cloud Compute deployments (i.e. multiple Compute Consoles) and you're aggregating all messages in a single log management system.
The custom string serves as a marker that lets you correlate specific events to specific deployments.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Manage > Alerts > Logging*.

. Set *Syslog* to *Enabled*.

. For *Identifier*, click *Edit*, and enter a string.


=== Console events

Both Console and Defender emit messages.
Console syslog messages are tagged as _Twistlock-Console_ in the logs.

The data emitted to syslog and stdout is exactly the same.

[.section]
==== Access audit

Docker commands run on hosts protected by Defender.

With user access events, you can determine who performed an action, and on which resource.

For example:

* [Bruce] [started container X] in the [DEV environment] (allowed).
* [Bruce] [stopped container Y] in the [PROD environment] (denied).

All Docker commands issued to the Docker daemon are intercepted and inspected by Defender to determine if they comply with the policy set in Console.

The following diagram illustrates how Defender operates on the management plane:

. Bruce, a developer, issues a command, docker -H.

. Defender checks the command against the policies defined in the Console.
If the command is allowed, Defender forwards it to the Docker daemon for execution.
If the command is denied, the user is notified.

. An event is recorded in syslog.

image::runtime-security/syslog-integration-554971.png[width=500]

Access audits have the following fields:

* type=access_audit
* user=[String] Identity of the person who ran the command
* action=[String] Docker command requested - API invoked
* action_type=[String] Action type
* allow=[Boolean] true/false - Action was allowed or not.
* rule=[String] Rule matched

[.section]
==== App firewall audit (WAAS)

All events associated with WAAS (Web-Application and API Security) rules for container, hosts and app-embedded generate audits.

NOTE: WAAS serverless events are not registered in the syslog. Events audits will be registered to the syslog in future releases.

NOTE: WAAS Container and Host rule audits are written to the Defender host's syslog. WAAS App-Embedded rule audits are written to the console's host's syslog.

Message fields for WAAS audit would change based on the deployment type as follows:

.Container Deployment
- *container_id=[String]* Container id in which the event triggered
- *container_name=[String]* Container name on which the action was performed
- *image_name=[String]* Image name on which the action was performed
- *custom_labels=[String]* User-defined Alert Labels (*Mange > Alerts > Alert Labels*)
- *cluster=[String]* Cluster name in which the event triggered

.Host Deployment
- *hostname=[String]* host in which the event triggered
- *cluster=[String]* Cluster name in which the event triggered

.App Embedded Deployment
- *app_id=[String]* app_id in which the event triggered

.All Deployments
- *time=[String]* request timestamp
- *type=[String]* type of app_firewall_audit
- *effect=[String]* "alert", "prevent", "ban"
- *msg=[String]* Audit message detailing the event
- *log_type=[String]* Attack Type
- *source_ip=[String]* source IP address from the request originated
- *source_country=[String]* country associated with source IP address
- *connecting_ips=[CSV]* list of IPs included in the _X-Forwarded-For_ header
- *request_method=[String]* HTTP Request Method
- *request_user_agents=[String]* user-agent string parsed from the ``User-Agent`` header
- *request_host=[String]* HTTP hostname in the request
- *request_url=[String]* request url
- *request_path=[String]* request path
- *request_query=[String]* request query string
- *request_header_names=[String]* ordered list of HTTP request headers
- *response_header_names=[String]* ordered list of HTTP response headers
- *status_code=[String]* HTTP response status code in the server response

In addition, message structure is subject for the following changes:

- Fields containing empty values are omitted from the message i.e. if a HTTP message does not contain a query field the request_query field will not be present in the message.
- *connecting_ips* - present only if `X-Forwarded-For` Header is present in the request.
- *status_code* - present only for audits created for the "Track Server Error Response Codes" and "Detect Information Leakage" protections
- *response_header_names* - present only for audits created for the "Track Server Error Response Codes" and "Detect Information Leakage" protections.
- *source_country* - present only if resolution was successful.
- *container_name* - will be replaced by *host_id* or *function_id*

==== Process activity audit

Records all processes spawned in a container.

Process audits are only recorded when *Detailed output of all runtime process activity* is enabled in *Manage > Alerts > Logging*.

Note that process activity that breaches your runtime policy is separately audited.
For more information, see the container runtime audit section.

This audit has the following fields:

* type=process
* pid=Process ID
* path=Path to the executable in the container file system
* interactive=Whether the process was spawned from a shell session: true or false
* container-id=Container ID

Example: This audit shows that busybox was spawned in the container with ID 8c5b3fe0037d.

=== Rate limiters

Depending on your configuration, Prisma Cloud can produce a lot of logs, especially in environments with many hosts, images, and containers.
By default, most syslog daemons throttle logging with a rate limiter.

If you have a large environment (hundreds of Defenders with tens of images per host) AND you have configured Prisma Cloud for verbose syslog output, you will need to tune the rate limiter.
Otherwise, you might find that logs are missing.

For example, on RHEL 7, you must tune both systemd-journald's `RateLimitInterval` and `RateLimitBurst` settings and rsyslog's `imjournalRatelimitInterval` and `imjournalRatelimitBurst` settings.
For more information about RedHat settings, see
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1417483[How to disable log rate-limiting in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7].


=== Truncated log messages

Very long syslog events can get truncated.
For example, changing settings in Console generates management_audits events, which show a diff between old settings and new settings.
For policies changes, the diff can be big.
Linux log managers limit the number of characters logged per line, and so long messages, such as management audits, can be truncated.

If you've got truncated log messages, increase the log manager's default string size limit.
There are several types log managers, but rsyslog is popular with most distributions.
For rsyslog, the default log string size is 1024 characters per line.
To increase it, open _/etc/rsyslog.conf_ and set the maximum message size:

[source,console]

  $MaxMessageSize 20k
