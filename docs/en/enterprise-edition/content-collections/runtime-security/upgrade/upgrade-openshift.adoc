[#upgrade-openshift]
== OpenShift

Upgrade Prisma Cloud running in your OpenShift cluster.

First upgrade Console.
Console will then automatically upgrade all deployed Defenders for you.

If you've disabled Defender auto-upgrade or if Console fails to upgrade one or more Defenders, manually upgrade your Defenders.

[NOTE]
====
You must manually upgrade App-Embedded Defenders.
