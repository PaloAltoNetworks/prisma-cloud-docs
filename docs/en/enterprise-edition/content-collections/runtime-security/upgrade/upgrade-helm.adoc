== Upgrade with Helm Charts

If you installed Prisma Cloud into your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster with Helm charts, you can upgrade with the _helm upgrade_ command.

Prisma Cloud automatically upgrades all deployed Defenders for you.

If you've disabled Defender auto-upgrade or if Prisma Cloud can't upgrade one or more Defenders, manually upgrade your Defenders.

NOTE: You must manually upgrade App-Embedded Defenders.

=== Upgrade Defender DaemonSets with Helm

Generate an updated Helm chart for the Defender DaemonSet, and then upgrade to it.

[.procedure]
. Create an updated Defender DaemonSet Helm chart.

  $ ./twistcli defender export kubernetes \
    --address <PATH_TO_CONSOLE> \
    --user <ADMIN_USER> \
    --cluster-address <REGION_CODE>.cloud.twistlock.com \
    --helm
    
+
Get the value for "--address" from *Runtime Security > Manage > System > Utilities > Path to Console*.
+
The value for "--cluster-address" will be only the region, with .cloud.twistlock.com appended.
+
Example command for the app4, us-west1 stack:
+
----
./twistcli defender export kubernetes \
    --address https://us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-4-xxxxxx \
    --user serviceAccountUsername \
    --cluster-address us-west1.cloud.twistlock.com \
    --helm
---- 
+
For Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition, the user is either an access key, or a service account username.

. Install the updated chart.

  $ helm upgrade twistlock-defender-ds \
    --namespace twistlock \
    --recreate-pods
    ./twistlock-defender-helm.tar.gz
