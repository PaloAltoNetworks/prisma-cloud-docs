.. If necessary, adjust the *Proxy timeout*

NOTE: The maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire request, including the body. A 500 error response is returned if a request is not read within the timeout period. For applications dealing with large files, adjusting the proxy timeout is necessary.

NOTE: Applying a rule to all images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid - instead, only specify your web application images.

ifdef::waas_hosts[]
Collections define a combination of hosts to which WAAS should attach itself to protect the web application:

endif::waas_oob_hosts[]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all hosts/images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid and a waste of resources.
WAAS only needs to be applied to hosts that run applications that transmit and receive HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

NOTE: When deploying WAAS OOB on K8s cluster, increase the `cgroup` limit to 4 GB to avoid

endif::waas_oob_containers[]

. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Runtime Security > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.

. (Optional) Enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint to deploy WAAS protection on ports identified in the unprotected web apps report in *Runtime Security > Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
+
[NOTE]
====
As an additional measure, you can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app to also include the ports that may not have been detected automatically.

By enabling both *Automatically detect ports* and *API endpoint discovery*, you can monitor your API endpoints and ports without having to add an application and without configuring any policies.

ifdef::waas_inline_hosts[]
*Automatically detect ports* is not available for Windows Operating System.

. *Save* the rule.
