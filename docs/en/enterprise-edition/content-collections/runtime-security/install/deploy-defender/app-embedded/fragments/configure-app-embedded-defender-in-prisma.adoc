Prisma Console provides you with an App-Embedded Defender bundle that contains the Dockerfile with App-Embedded configurations and the Defender installation binary file.

You can select one of the *Deployment types*: Dockerfile or Manual.

* *Dockerfile*: Creates a new Dockerfile based on your Dockerfile and embeds the App-Embedded parameters.
* *Manual*: Select the manual method to customize the required Dockerfile parameters in the Console UI and directly download the App-Embedded Defender binary file.
