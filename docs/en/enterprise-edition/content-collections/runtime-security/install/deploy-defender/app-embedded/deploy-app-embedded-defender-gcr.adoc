[#deploy-app-embedded-defender-gcr]
== Deploy App-Embedded Defender in Google Cloud Run (GCR)

Deploy an App-Embedded Defender in GCR to provide runtime protection to App-Embedded applications installed in GCR.

The App-Embedded Defender enforces runtime policy on the application entrypoint and any child processes created by this entrypoint.
To learn when to use App-Embedded Defenders, see xref:../defender-types.adoc[Defender types].

To learn more about App-Embedded Defender's capabilities, see:

[#sys-reqs]
=== System Requirements

* GCR supports Linux (X86) containers
* Any Docker image with Prisma Cloud App-Embedded Defender binary
* Google Cloud Registry (recommended)

[#prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites

* You can connect to GCR and DockerHub

*Configure GCP to authenticate Prisma Cloud*

* Sign in to your Google Cloud account.
* Log in to Google Cloud Registry.
* In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
** Set "private" visibility for your GCP container registry host under *GCP project > Home > Container Registry > Settings*.
* Configure GCloud authentication using any of the following options:

** Authenticate using GCP user credentials:

  $ gcloud auth login ### Type the User GCP credentials
  $ cat ~/.docker/config.json  ### Check that GCP has gcloud users configured

** Authenticate using GCP Service Account:

  $ gcloud auth activate-service-account ACCOUNT --key-file=KEY-FILE
  ### KEY-FILE is the Service Account key file under *GCP > Service Accounts > Actions > Manage keys*

*Configure Docker for GCP in your localhost*

  $ gcloud auth configure-docker
  $ cat ~/.docker/config.json.  ### check that GCP has gcloud users configured

[#defender-dockerfile]
[.task]
==== Embed App-Embedded Defender with Dockerfile

Upload your Dockerfile and Prisma Cloud creates a new Dockerfile with App-Embedded Defender parameters and the Defender binary file.

[.procedure]
include::fragments/embed-app-embedded-defender-with-dockerfile.adoc[leveloffet=0]
. Rebuild the image and embed the Defender in GCR.

[#defender-in-gcr]
[.task]
=== Embed App-Embedded Defender in GCR

Prisma Cloud uses the updated Dockerfile to deploy the Defender in your containers running in GCR.
Use the updated Dockerfile to build the image for App-Embedded Defender, push it to Google Container Registry, and then run the Google Container instance.

*Prerequisite*:

* Create a new https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos[GCR repository], if not already exists.

[.procedure]

. Log in to Docker

  docker login

. Copy the App-Embedded zipped bundle and unzip it to get the Dockerfile and App-Embedded Defender binary.

. Build the Dockerfile:

  docker build -t <GCP_Container_Registry>:<docker_images_name>  <local_path_host_dockerfile>
+
If your Dockerfile is in the current directory, use *.* for <local_path_host-Dockerfile>

. *Push the docker image to GCR*:

  docker push HOSTNAME/PROJECT-ID/IMAGE:TAG

.. Verify the docker image exists in your *GCP project > Container Registry > Images* under your relevant repository.

. *Deploy Docker image in Google Cloud Run using Google Console*:

.. Select your *Container Registry > Images*, and select *Actions > Deploy to Cloud Run*.
.. Enter a *Service name* or select the default value.
.. Set the *CPU allocation and pricing* to *CPU is always allocated*.
.. Select the *Ingress* traffic to allow *All* requests, including requests directly from the internet to the *run*.

. In the *Container, Networking, Security* section, enter the *Container port* as 8080.

. Select *CREATE*.

. Go to *Cloud Run* and verify the Docker Container service running in GCP.
+
This App-Embedded Defender running in GCR is now recognized in Prisma Console under *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders*.

#### Delete a Container Instance

  $ az container delete -g <MyContainerGroup> --name <Container-name> -y

[#trigger-events]
=== Trigger Events for App-Embedded

Refer to xref:../../../runtime-defense/runtime-defense-app-embedded.adoc[Runtime defense for App-Embedded].

To trigger the App Server logs, get the GCP URL from GCP Docker Container service.

  $ curl -k -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" <app_emb_gcp_URL>/runsee -d $(echo 'ldd --help'|base64)

[#monitor-events]
=== Monitor App-Embedded Events

You can view the xref:../../../runtime-defense/runtime-defense-app-embedded.adoc[App-Embedded runtime events] by app ID under *Monitor > Events > App-Embedded audits*, and view the xref:../../../runtime-defense/incident-explorer.adoc[App-Embedded incidents] under *Monitor > Runtime > Incident Explorer*.

You can also xref:../../../waas/deploy-waas/app-embedded.adoc[deploy WAAS for Containers Protected By App-Embedded Defender], create a WAAS rule policy, add an app, enable protections, run WAAS sanity tests, and monitor the events under *Monitor > Events > WAAS for App-Embedded*.
