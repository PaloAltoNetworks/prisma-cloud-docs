== Deploy a Single Container Defender using the CLI

Use the `twistcli` CLI tool to install a single Container Defender on a Linux host.

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../../system-requirements.adoc[system requirements].

** Port 443 is open for outgoing traffic from your host.

* You have sudo access to the host where you want to deploy the Defender.
* You've created a service account with the Defender Manager role.
twistcl uses the service account to access Console.

[.procedure]
. Verify that the host where you install Defender can connect to the Prisma Cloud console.

.. Copy the path to the value under *Path to Console* from *Runtime Security > Manage > System > Utilities*.
.. Complete the following command with copied value.
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host.
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.

. SSH to the host where you want to install Defender.

. Download twistcli.

  $ curl -k \
    -u <USER> \
    -L \
    -o twistcli \
    https://<CONSOLE>/api/v1/util/twistcli

. Make the twistcli binary executable.

  $ chmod a+x ./twistcli

. Install Defender.

  $ sudo ./twistcli defender install standalone container-linux \
    --address https://<CONSOLE> \
    --user <USER>

. Verify Defender was installed correctly.

  $ sudo docker ps
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
  677c9883c4b6   twistlock/private:defender_21_04_333   "/usr/local/bin/defeâ€¦"   11 seconds ago   Up 10 seconds            twistlock_defender_21_04_333


[.task]
=== Verify the install

Verify that Defender is installed and connected to Console.

[NOTE]
====
Defender can be deployed and run with full functionality when dockerd is configured with SELinux enabled (--selinux-enabled=true).
All features will work normally and without any additional configuration steps required.
Prisma Cloud automatically detects the SELinux configuration on a per-host basis and self-configures itself as needed.
No action is needed from the user.
====

// It would be useful to add a troubleshooting section here.
// First step: Go to the host, and validate that the Defender container is actually running.
// Need to provide steps for each Defender type (Linux Server, Windows Server, Windows Container Host).
// Verify that Defender is running on the host.
//
//  $ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}" | grep defender
//  twistlock_defender: Up 7 minutes

[.procedure]
. In the Prisma Cloud console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders*.
+
Your new Defender should be listed in the table, and the status box should be green and checked.
