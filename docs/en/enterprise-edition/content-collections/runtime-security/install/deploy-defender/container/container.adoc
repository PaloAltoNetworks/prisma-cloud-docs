== Install a Single Container Defender

Install Container Defender on each host that you want Prisma Cloud to protect.

Single Container Defenders can be configured in the Console UI, and then deployed with a curl-bash script.
Alternatively, you can use xref:./single-defender-cli.adoc[twistcli to configure] and deploy Defender directly on a host.

=== Install a single Container Defender (Console UI)

Configure how a single Container Defender will be installed, and then install it with the resulting curl-bash script.

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../../system-requirements.adoc[system requirements].
* Ensure your host can access the Prisma Cloud console the network.

** Port 443 is open for outgoing traffic from your host.

* You have sudo access to the host where you want to deploy the Defender.

[.procedure]
. Verify that the host machine where you install Defender can connect to the Prisma Cloud console.

.. Copy the path to the value under *Path to Console* from *Runtime Security > Manage > System > Utilities*.
.. Complete the following command with copied value.
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host system.
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.

. Go to *Runtime Security > Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders* and select *Manual deploy*.

. Under *Deployment method*, select *Single Defender*.

. Select your desired *Defender type*

. Under *The name that Defender will use to connect to this Console* select the correct item from the list of IP addresses and hostnames pre-populated in the drop-down list.
After adding a SAN, your IP address or hostname will be available in the drop-down list.
+
[NOTE]
====
Selecting an IP address in a evaluation setup is acceptable, but using a DNS name is more resilient.
If you select Console's IP address, and Console's IP address changes, your Defenders will no longer be able to communicate with Console.
====
. Under *Defender and Console communication* enter the following optional configuration.

.. Set a custom communication port for the Defender to use.


..  Set a proxy for the Defender to use for the communication with the Prisma Cloud console.

. Under *Advanced Settings*, you can enter the following additional network configurations.

.. Select the xref:../../../access-control/rbac.adoc#_defender_listener_type[listener type]. The default setting is *None*.

.. Set *Assign globally unique names to Hosts* to *ON* when you have multiple hosts that can have the same hostname.
+
[NOTE]
====
After setting the toggle to *ON*, Prisma Cloud appends a unique identifier, such as ResourceId, to the host's DNS name.
For example, an AWS EC2 host would have the following name: `Ip-171-29-1-244.ec2internal-i-04a1dcee6bd148e2d`.
====

. Copy the install command from the *Installation* sidebar. The script is generated according to the options you selected.

. On the host where you want to install Defender, paste the command into a shell window, and run it.

[.task]
=== Verify the install

Verify that Defender is installed and connected to Console.

NOTE: Defender can be deployed and run with full functionality when dockerd is configured with SELinux enabled (--selinux-enabled=true).
All features will work normally and without any additional configuration steps required.
Prisma Cloud automatically detects the SELinux configuration on a per-host basis and self-configures itself as needed.
No action is needed from the user.

// It would be useful to add a troubleshooting section here.
// First step: Go to the host, and validate that the Defender container is actually running.
// Need to provide steps for each Defender type (Linux Server, Windows Server, Windows Container Host).
// Verify that Defender is running on the host.
//
//  $ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}" | grep defender
//  twistlock_defender: Up 7 minutes

[.procedure]
. In Console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders*.
+
Your new Defender should be listed in the table, and the status box should be green and checked.
