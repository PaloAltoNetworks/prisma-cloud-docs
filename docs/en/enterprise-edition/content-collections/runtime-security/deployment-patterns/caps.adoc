== Storage Limits for Audits and Reports

Prisma Cloud restricts the size of some data collections to prevent misconfigured or noisy systems from consuming all available disk space and compromising the availability of the Console service.

=== Registry Scanning

Prisma Cloud scans a maximum of 1,000,000 registry images, ordered by most recently published.
Publish date is the time an image is pushed to the registry.

=== Data Collections Limits

The following limits are currently enforced in Console's database.

For audits: if you must retain all audits, consider configuring Console to send audits to syslog, and then forward the audits to a log management system for long term storage.
