== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Jira

Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with Jira and receive Prisma Cloud alerts in your Jira accounts.

Integrate Prisma® Cloud with Jira and receive Prisma Cloud alert notifications in your Jira accounts. With this integration, you can automate the process of generating Jira tickets with your existing security workflow.

This integration works with all Jira Cloud and Jira On-Premises versions prior to 9.0. 

To set up this integration, you need to ensure network reachability and xref:../../get-started/access-prisma-cloud.adoc[Enable Access to the Prisma Cloud Console] if you have a firewall or cloud Network Security Group between the internet and Jira On-Premise version.
