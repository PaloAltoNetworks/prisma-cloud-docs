== Add Notification Template

Learn how to send Prisma Cloud alert notifications to your existing tools so that you can incorporate cloud security into your existing operational procedures.

Alert rules define which policy violations trigger an alert in a selected set of cloud accounts. When you create an Alert Rule for runtime checks, you can also configure the rule to send the Alert Payload that the rule triggers to one or more third-party tools. For all channels except email, to enable notification of policy violations in your cloud environments in your existing operational workflows, you must xref:configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud.adoc[configure external integrations on Prisma Cloud]. You can either set up an integration before you create the alert rule or use the inline link in the alert rule creation process to set up the integration when you need it.

//On some integrations, such as Google CSCC, AWS Security Hub, PagerDuty, and ServiceNow, Prisma Cloud can send a state-change notification to resolve an incident when the issue that generated the alert is resolved manually or if the resource was updated in the cloud environment and the service learns that the violation is fixed.

=== Send Alert Notifications Through Email

To send email notifications for alerts triggered by an alert rule, Prisma Cloud provides a default email notification template. You can customize the message in the template using the in-app rich text editor and attach the template to an alert rule. In the alert notification, you can configure Prisma Cloud to send the alert details as an uncompressed CSV file or as a compressed zip file, of 9 MB maximum attachment size.

All email notifications from Prisma Cloud include the domain name to support Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), and the email address used is noreply@prismacloud.paloaltonetworks.com.

[.procedure]
. (tt:[Optional]) Set up a custom message for your email notification template.
+
Prisma Cloud provides a default email template for your convenience, and you can customize the lead-in message within the body of the email using the rich-text editor.

.. Select *Settings > Integrations & Notifications > Notification Templates*.

.. Select *Add Notification Template > Email* notification template from the list.

.. Enter a *Template Name*.
+
The total length of the template name can be up to 99 characters and should not include special ASCII characters: (‘<’, ‘>’, ‘!’, ‘=’, ‘\n’, ‘\r’).
+
If you had previously created a template that includes the unsupported characters and you try to update the template, an error message will indicate that the template name is invalid.

.. Enter a *Custom Note* and select *Next*.
+
The preview on the right gives you an idea of how your content will look.

. Select menu:Alerts[Alert Rules] and either create an Alert Rule for runtime checks or select an existing rule to edit.

. Select *Configure Notifications > Email*.

. Enter or select the *Emails* for which to send the alert notifications.
+
You can include multiple email addresses and can send email notifications to email addresses in your domain and to guests external to your organization.

. Set the toggle to *Enabled* to send alert notifications and *Next*.

. (tt:[Optional]) Select your custom email *Template*, if you have one.

. Set the *Frequency* at which to send email notifications.
+
* *Instantly*—Sends an email to the recipient list each time the alert rule triggers an alert.
* *Recurring*—You can select the time interval as Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. Prisma Cloud sends a single email to the recipient list that lists all alerts triggered by the alert rule on that day, during that week, or the month.

. Specify whether to include an attachment to the email.
+
Including an attachment provides a way for you to include information on the alerts generated and the remediation steps required to fix the violating resource. When you select *Attach detailed report*, you can choose whether to *Include remediation instructions* to fix the root cause for the policy that triggered each alert, and opt to send it as a zip file (*Compress attachment(s)*).
+
Each email can include up to 10 attachments. An attachment in the zip file format can have 60000 rows, while a CSV file can have 900 rows. If the number of alerts exceeds the maximum number of attachments, the alerts with the older timestamps are omitted.
+

. Review the *Summary* and *Save* the new alert rule or changes to an existing alert rule.

. Verify the alert notification emails.
+
The email alert notification specifies the alert rule, account name, cloud type, policies that were violated, the number of alerts each policy violated, and the affected resources. Click the *<number>* of alerts to view the Prisma Cloud menu:Alerts[Overview] page.

----
Jira state transition is not possible for configured state
----
