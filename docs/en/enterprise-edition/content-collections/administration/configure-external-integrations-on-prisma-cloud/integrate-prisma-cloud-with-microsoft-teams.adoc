== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Microsoft Teams
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Microsoft Teams.

Microsoft Teams is a cloud-based team collaboration software that is part of the Office 365 suite of applications and is used for workplace chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration.

Prisma™ Cloud integrates with Microsoft Teams and monitors your assets and sends alerts on resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities either as they happen or as a consolidated summary card—determined by how you configure alert notifications. Each alert message is a webhook notification that includes details such as the cloud type, policy name, and the resource that triggered the alert and the message card indicates the severity with a red (high), yellow (medium) or gray (low) line to help you quickly assess alert severity.
+++<draft-comment>I don’t think “easy scanning” is what we want to say but I’m struggling to come up with a more appropriate word. I was initially thinking “for accelerated assessment” but I don’t think that sounds right, either. Maybe “to help you quickly identify high severity alerts” or “quickly assess alert severity?”</draft-comment>+++.
