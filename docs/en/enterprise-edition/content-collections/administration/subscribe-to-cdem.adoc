[#pre-req-for-cdem-aws]
=== Pre-requisites to Secure Exposed AWS Assets

To enable Cloud Discovery and Exposure Management (CDEM) to convert the unmanaged (shadow IT) to managed (secure) AWS assets, you must configure your AWS Organization account as follows:

[.procedure]

. *Create an Inline Policy*
+
.. Select *IAM > Roles* in the AWS Management Console.

.. Locate and select the desired IAM role created while onboarding your AWS Organization account to Prisma Cloud, then attach the custom inline policy. Click the role's name to access its details.

.. Within the role details page, navigate to the *Permissions* tab.

.. Select *Add permissions > Create Inline policy*.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CrossAccountRoleForAWSNetworkQueryTool",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/CrossAccountRoleForAWSNetworkQueryTool"
        }

.. Open the AWS Management Console and select *Services > CloudFormation > StackSets > Create StackSet* for the member account.

.. Enter a *StackSet Name* and optional *StackSet Description*.

.. For Execution configuration, choose *Active* or *Inactive*. For faster deployment, select *Active*.

.. Under *Add stacks to stack set*, select *Deploy new stacks* option.

.. Under *Deployment targets*, select the *Deploy to organization* option.

.. In *Auto-deployment* Options:
+
... Choose *Activated* for *Automatic deployment*.

... Select *Delete Stacks* for *Account removal behavior*.
+

.. In *Specify regions*, select a single region from the list. Ensure that the region is enabled on all accounts in your AWS Organization. If you select a disabled region, the template will fail with errors because it cannot deploy resources within that region.

.. In *Deployment* Options:
+
... Set Maximum concurrent accounts to 1.
... Set Failure tolerance to 0.
... Keep the default option of *Sequential* under Region Concurrency.
+

.. Select *Next* and review the configuration.

.. Select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names* and *Submit*.

.. The StackSet creation process begins. Wait for the status to show "SUCCEEDED".
+
After completion, stacks are created for all the member accounts linked to the master account and listed under *Stack instances* in the AWS Management Console.

[#enable-cdem-subscription]

image::administration/cdem-aa-enable.png[]

. Once the subscription is enabled, you will receive a 14-day trial. You will receive three email notifications during the trial period indicating the upcoming trial expiry and how to continue with your subscription. After the trial period ends, you can continue the subscription and utilize credits to maintain access to the service or unsubscribe from CDEM. Alternatively, you can also choose directly to subscribe to the paid version of CDEM.

. Upon subscription, Prisma Cloud initiates scans across the internet to identify your digital footprint.
+
[NOTE] 
====
The initial scanning process may take a few hours to complete, up to 24 hours depending on your cloud setup. After this, subsequent scans will happen automatically every 2 hours, ensuring your information is up-to-date.
====

. Once the initial data on your internet-exposed unmanaged (shadow IT) assets are available on Prisma Cloud, you will receive an email notification to your inbox. Select View Dashboard in the email to log into Prisma Cloud and access the xref:../dashboards/dashboards-discovery-exposure-management.adoc[Discovery and Exposure Management (CDEM) dashboard] to view detailed information about your attack surface.
