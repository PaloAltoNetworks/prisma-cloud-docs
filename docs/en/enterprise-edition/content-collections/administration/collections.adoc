[procedure]

. Enter a name for the Collection in the *Name* field and provide an optional *Description* for reference.
. Define the scope of the Collection by selecting the Account Groups, Cloud Accounts, and Repositories which contain the assets you wish to include.
. Select *Next* and *Save* to finalize your changes.


*Manage Collections*

Previously created Collections can be edited, cloned or deleted as needed. Explore the various options as shown below:

Next, review how you can use a collection to track key metrics for the assets you wish to monitor, with Prisma Cloud's xref:../dashboards/dashboards-code-to-cloud.adoc[Code to Cloud dashboard].

[NOTE]
====
When you create a collection, you can select any repository that is added on *Prisma Cloud on Settings > Code & Build Providers*. If the repository is removed subsequently, the Collection is not automatically updated.
