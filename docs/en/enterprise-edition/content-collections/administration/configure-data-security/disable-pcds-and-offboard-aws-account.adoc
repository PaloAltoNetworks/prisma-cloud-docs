== Disable Prisma Cloud Data Security and Offboard AWS account

* *Disable Prisma Cloud Data Security*
+
** On menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts], select the AWS account for which you want to disable Data Security, click *Edit*, and deselect the *Data Security* option. Prisma Cloud stops ingestion of data stored in S3 buckets for the account. The Data Security information from earlier scans are not deleted on Prisma Cloud, and you have access to the alerts that were generated during the period when Data Security was enabled.
+
If you do not plan to re-enable Data Security for this AWS account, you can delete the SNS topic to avoid the additional cost of that SNS topic sending messages to Prisma Cloud. You can also stop sending S3 events to the CloudTrail bucket, if you had set it up only for Prisma Cloud.

** You can easily re-enable Data Security on menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts]. Select the AWS account for which you want to enable Data Security, click *Edit*, and select the *Data Security* option. Prisma Cloud starts ingesting data again and your usage charge will resume. All the data (before you disabled Data Security) and new data (after you re-enabled Data Security) will be available for you.

* *Offboard and onboard an AWS account within 24 hours* 
+
** If you offboard a previously onboarded AWS account that had Data Security enabled, all the scanned data including alerts will no longer be available in the UI or via the APIs. Prisma Cloud stops further ingestion of the data stored within the account.

** If you add the same AWS account within 24 hours and enable Data Security, all the previously scanned data will be available in the UI and via the APIs again. You can view all alerts that were generated before you offboarded the account, for example open alerts will remain open and resolved will remain resolved. Prisma Cloud will resume data ingestion for the account.

* *Offboard and onboard an AWS account after 24 hours*
+
** If you offboard a previously onboarded AWS account that had Data Security enabled, all the scanned data including alerts will no longer be available in the UI or via the APIs. Prisma Cloud stops further ingestion of the data stored within the account.

** After the account has been offboarded for more than 24 hours, Prisma Cloud will delete all the previously scanned data related to Data Security in your tenant.

** Since Prisma Cloud stops ingestion of new S3 data, you will also stop incurring additional charges for Data Security.

** If you onboard the same AWS account after 24 hours and enable Data Security, Prisma Cloud will start ingesting data from scratch again for the account and start charging for usage. Only the new data (after you re-enabled Data Security) will be available. All the previously scanned data will not be available, except for the alerts that were generated during that period.

[NOTE]
====
The original alerts will not be resolved and new alerts will be created on the same objects, which will create duplicate alerts on the same objects.
====

* *Offboard an AWS account that was previously enabled for Prisma Cloud Data Security*
+
** After the AWS account has been offboarded for more than 24 hours, Prisma Cloud will delete all the previously scanned data and alerts.

** If you do not plan to enable Data Security for the AWS account in the future, you can delete the SNS topic to avoid the additional cost of that SNS topic sending messages to Prisma Cloud. You can also stop sending S3 events to the CloudTrail bucket, if you had set it up only for Prisma Cloud.
