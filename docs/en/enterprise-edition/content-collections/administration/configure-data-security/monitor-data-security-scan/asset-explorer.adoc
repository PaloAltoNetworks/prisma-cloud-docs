== Asset Explorer

The Asset Explorer provides you visibility into each cloud asset monitored by Prisma Cloud. The Asset Explorer for storage assets has been extended to show you all objects that belong to a particular asset. You can now view all objects with object name, object profile, object pattern, malware and exposure for each object. For example, you can see the Audit Trail and Objects tabs on *Investigate* by entering the following RQL in *Advanced Mode*:

* For AWS, userinput:[config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl'] or userinput:[config from cloud.resource where cloud.service = 'Amazon S3'] .
