.. *Configure Scan* to scan all your resources or you can choose to customize what you want to scan.
+
* When you select *Scan All Resources*, Prisma Cloud will forward scan and backward scan all eligible objects in the resources for public exposure, sensitive data, and malware. The forward scan inspects any new or modified objects, and the backward scan is retrospective, which means that it inspects objects that exist in the resource. The size and number of objects that you want to scan within your resource will determine how many Prisma Cloud credits are used for Data Security.

* When you select *Custom Scan Resources*, Prisma Cloud will forward scan and/or backward scan eligible objects in selected resources.
