== Configure Data Security for AWS Organization

//Onboard AWS organization account and enable data security.

After onboarding an AWS organization account, you can configure data security and start scanning your S3 buckets. Prisma Cloud creates two separate sets of AWS resources based on whether your onboarded account is an individual account or an organization account. You can onboard all the Organization Units (OUs) and Member Accounts under root or pick and choose the OUs and Member Accounts under root for selective onboarding. You must onboard the AWS organization first and you can then configure Prisma Cloud Data Security.

[.procedure]
. After you successfully https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-your-aws-account/add-aws-organization-to-prisma-cloud.html#idafad1015-aa36-473e-8d6a-a526c16d2c4f[onboard] your AWS organization account, go to menu:Settings[Cloud Accounts > Account Overview] and select *Configure* to configure data security for your AWS organization account.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have already onboarded an AWS member account as an individual account and enabled Data Security for it, you must https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-data-security/disable-pcds-and-offboard-aws-account.html[disable] data security for that member account to ensure that it is included as a part of the AWS Organization.

. Create a stack in your AWS master organization account.

.. Select *Create Stack*.
+
In the Prisma Cloud console, the *AWS Management External ID* and *SNS Endpoint URL* values are pre-populated and you cannot edit those fields.

.. Log in to your AWS account in a separate tab. Copy and paste the *AWS Management External ID* and *SNS Endpoint URL* values from your Prisma Cloud console in the corresponding AWS Management Console fields.
+
[NOTE]
====
The CloudFormation template defaults to N. Virginia. You must change it to the region where your AWS Account is before you create the stack.

.. Click *Next*.

. Configure the AWS Member Account.

.. Download the *CloudFormation* member template.
+
Complete the onscreen instructions to create the StackSet.

image::administration/aws-org-6.png[]
+
Create an *ExternalId* by using a combination of letters, numbers, and/or hyphens. For example, varname:[Test-number-123], varname:[05dd1aca-244a-447c-ab1e-aac935fd3348], and varname:[12345-test-abc] are all valid member *ExternalIds*. The *PrismaCloudRoleName* is auto-populated but you have the option to modify it as long as it contains varname:[Org] within the string.

.. Under *Execution configuration*, select *Active* or *Inactive*, and click *Next*.
+
For faster deployment, it is recommended you select *Active*.
+

+
image::administration/pcds-aws-org-cloudtrail-1.png[]

(Optional) If you select *Existing* and a topic that is associated with the CloudTrail already exists, create a new SNS subscription in the existing topic. Make sure to use the https endpoint (callback URL) mentioned on the *Cloud Accounts* page of Prisma Cloud in the subscription.
+
image::administration/pcds-aws-org-cloudtrail-4.png[]
+
Irrespective of what you select (new or existing), make sure the callback URL in Prisma Cloud matches the SNS subscription endpoint in AWS.
