== Get Started with OIDC SSO

OpenID Connect https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/[OpenID Connect (OIDC)] is an open security protocol for authentication based on the OAuth 2.0 framework. Prisma Cloud offers the option to set up SSO, leveraging Service Provider initiated OIDC. Enable OIDC to allow Prisma Cloud System Administrators to configure tenants. Users then have the option to sign in with their Identity Provider (IdP) credentials, by selecting the *Sign in via SSO* button as shown below.

[CAUTION]
====
To avoid account lockout, you must enable a few administrative users with both local authentication credentials on Prisma Cloud and SSO access. Ensure that each administrator has activated their Palo Alto Networks Customer Support Portal (CSP) account using the Welcome to Palo Alto Networks Support email and set a password to access the portal.
====

Complete the steps below on the Prisma Cloud console and your IdP to set up OIDC:
[.procedure]
. Log in to Prisma Cloud using an account with System Administrator privileges to configure SSO and redirect login requests to the IdPâ€™s login page.
. Complete the following steps on your Prisma Cloud tenant:
.. Select menu:Settings[Access Control > SSO] and select *OIDC* as shown below.

.. Copy the *Audience URI* value. This is a read-only field in the format that uniquely identifies your instance of Prisma Cloud. This value is required to configure OIDC on your IdP.
. Complete the setup on the IdP:
+
* xref:set-up-oidc-on-okta.adoc[Okta]
* xref:set-up-oidc-on-azure.adoc[Azure AD]
. Add callback URI previously created on Prisma Cloud to the IdP.
. After set up is complete you will be able to login using your email address and authentication will be completed on your IdP.
