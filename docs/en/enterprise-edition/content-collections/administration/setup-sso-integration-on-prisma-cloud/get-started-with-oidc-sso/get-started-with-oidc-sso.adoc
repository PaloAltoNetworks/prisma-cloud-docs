== Get Started with OIDC SSO

Prisma Cloud offers a Service Provider initiated SSO capability. Leveraging OpenID Connect https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/[OpenID Connect (OIDC)], this option enables Prisma Cloud System Administrators to allow users to sign in to Prisma Cloud with their Identity Provider (IdP) credentials using the *Sign in via SSO* button on the login page. Learn more about setting up SP-initiated SSO below.

[CAUTION]
====
To avoid account lockout while making configuration changes, you may enable administrative users with both local authentication credentials on Prisma Cloud and SSO access. Ensure that each administrator has activated their Palo Alto Networks Customer Support Portal (CSP) account using the Welcome to Palo Alto Networks Support email and set a password to access the portal.
====

Complete the steps below on the Prisma Cloud console and your IdP to set up OIDC:
[.procedure]
