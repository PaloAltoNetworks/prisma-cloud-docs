== Create Prisma Cloud Roles

Create Prisma Cloud roles to restrict user access to cloud accounts within an account group.

Roles on Prisma Cloud enable you to specify what permissions an administrator has, and to which cloud accounts they have access, what policies they can apply, and how they interact with alerts and reports, for example.

When you create a cloud account, you can assign one or more cloud account to account group(s) and then attach the account group to the role you create. This flow allows you to ensure the user/administrator who has the role can access the information related to only the cloud account(s) to which you have authorized access.

[.procedure]

. Enter a name and a description for the role.

See xref:prisma-cloud-administrator-roles.adoc#id437b5c4a-3dfa-4c70-8fc7-b6d074f5dffc[Prisma Cloud Administrator Roles] for a description of the following permission groups.

* Select *System Admin* to allow full access and control over all sections of Prisma Cloud including overall administration settings and permissions management. To limit access to the Compute capabilities and APIs that enable you to secure your host, serverless, and container deployments, select *Only for Compute capabilities*.

* Select *Account Group Admin* to allow full access over designated accounts including a subset of administration settings and permissions management for the designated *Account Groups* you specify. By default an Account Group Admin has the ability to dismiss, snooze, and resolve alerts that are generated against all policies included in an alert rule defined by the System Admin. You can, however, restrict the ability dismiss or resolve alerts.

* Select *Account ReadOnly* to allow read access to designated accounts across Prisma Cloud administrative console, excluding any administration settings and permissions management.

* Select *Account and Cloud Provisioning Admin*—to enable an administrator who is responsible for a line of business.With this role the permissions allow you to onboard cloud accounts, and access the dashboard, manage the security policies, investigate issues, view alerts and compliance details for the designated *Account Groups* you specify. By default an Account and Cloud Provisioning Admin has the ability to dismiss, snooze, and resolve alerts that are generated against all policies included in an alert rule defined by the System Admin.
