** Switch the *Active Role* — When you select a different role, the console reloads the page immediately. The role change is not saved, to save your default role preference, you must select *View Profile Settings*.

** Switch the *Theme* — Choose from Light, Dark, or inherit from your System default settings.

** Switch the *Texture* — Cloudy or Clear are the options for the background texture on the home page. This is a subtle change. 

** Switch the *Colorway* — The color selection here sets the highlight color of your selection in the console, the color of the prism on the Prisma Cloud switcher and the prism on the Home page.

If you have the System Administrator role, you are automatically subscribed to receive the Prisma Cloud Chronicles. This is a weekly email newsletter that informs you of your team's usage of Prisma Cloud, and summarizes the latest product improvements with links to the Release Notes. 
+
If you have more than one Prisma Cloud tenant and want to opt out of receiving Prisma Cloud Chronicles for all the administrators across these tenants,  you can *Unsubscribe From Prisma Cloud Chronicles* on *Settings > Enterprise Settings*.

* *Clear Theme Preferences* — This resets your focus for the Prisma Cloud switcher. Based on your selection — Cloud Security, Runtime Security, Application Security — the workflows and navigation on the console are adjusted for the security context. When you clear theme preferences, you have the ability to reset your avatar, theme, texture, and colorway preferences too.
