=== Key Features

Prisma Cloud is a SaaS platform comprising several features providing wholistic security coverage and protection. Let's take a closer at how you can proactively detect threats and protect your cloud resources with Prisma Cloud:

==== Cloud Security

Prisma Cloud's full breadth of Cloud Security capabilities helps you secure your cloud estate against attack vectors originating from  identity issues, misconfigurations, and unaddressed vulnerabilities. Tracking vulnerabilities across your cloud environment, Cloud Security helps you contextualize risks across your cloud environment with features such as:

//* Rapidly address your daily critical incident response with Prisma Cloud's prioritized *Urgent Critical Risks & Incidents*.  Out of the box customizable Attack Path policies help detect internet exposed applications running on a Virtual Machines with critical vulnerabilities, and overly permissive roles with access to a data stores containing sensitive data. Issues can immediately be escalated up the chain of command, and rapidly remediated with *Sent to Jira* to create a ticket or *Fix in Code* to create a PR.

* 99% of cloud users, roles, services, and resources had excessive permissions that remained unused. Prisma Cloud’s *Cloud Identity and Entitelment Management (CIEM)* capabilities helps you detect privilege access risks. With Cloud Security, you can view urgent alerts trigerred by overly permissive access and review and remediate net-effective permissions for both users and machines.  

//* Developers outnumber cloud security professionals 50 to 1 in most organizations making it increasingly complex to manage permissions and access to cloud resources. *Just In Time (JIT)* access provides a Zero Trust approach to permission management by limiting access to resources based on specific, time-limited permissions. JIT monitors the developer's activity on the resource in real-time and revokes access as soon as the specified time limit expires.  

* *Search and Investigate* helps you visualize your cloud estate to better understand the posture of your cloud assets. You can investigate all your security risks and incidents in one place contextually through an interactive graph and prioritize the most important vulnerabilites and identify root cases. 

* *Discovery and Exposure Management* Dashboard helps you view shadow assets from an attacker perspective and bring these assets under governance. Double click on any vulnerable unmanaged asset to send an email to the asset owner to investigate further. Alternatively, you can also map the asset to an account owner and select *Convert to Managed* to instantly onboard the asset and start governance.

//* Prisma Cloud's revolutionary AI Copilot leverages the power of AI and NLP to provide you with a seamless way to interact with the platform, streamlining complex security tasks, and empowering you to take proactive steps in securing your cloud infrastructure.

//The Copilot's conversational interface makes it easy for you to interact with the Prisma Cloud platform, without deep cloud security expertise. The Copilot automates routine security tasks, such as monitoring, threat detection, and policy enforcement, freeing up valuable time for you to focus on critical issues and strategic initiatives. The Copilot's real-time analytics and insights, empower you to make informed decisions about your security posture.

==== Runtime Security

Runtime security helps secure microservices, hosts, containers and serverless functions across the application lifecycle. With Prisma Cloud, your development teams can adopt the architecture that fits their needs without worrying about security keeping pace with release cycles or protecting a variety of tech stacks.

* Prisma Cloud includes a comprehensive inventory list of all APIs without any additional configuration, helping you discover shadow APIs. Clicking into any API endpoint provides comprehensive details, including clients communicating with it, and sensitive PII data transmitted by users and returned by servers. A graphical representation is alo available to provide a broader application context helping you identify the location of API exposing workload or services.

* The xref:../dashboards/dashboards-vulnerabilites.adoc[Vulnerabilites Dashboard] provides you a single pane of glass view into prioritized vulnerabilities, helping you move faster from finding to fixing. Vulnerability management teams can now see what engineers and DevOps are adding to the pipeline, while engineers and DevOps can see the impact of their contributions across code, deploy, and runtime assets. 

Explore any vulnerability widget to further investigate the vulnerable assets identified across the lifecycle, from IaC files in code & build to registry images deployed to the runtime as Hosts, Containers and Serverless Functions. Remediation options are available at the source, including creating a PR fix for the vulnerable packages.

==== Application Security

Application Security seamlessly integrates into your software delivery chain, capturing crucial information such as programming languages and frameworks, CI/CD pipelines and plugins. It then maps this information to their respective repositories, creating a comprehensive "Technical DNA" of your software engineering ecosystem, including robust Supply Chain security, providing a comprehensive inventory and visualization of application dependencies through a graphical interface designed to bridge developer, operations, and security workstreams. In addition, Application Security scans to detect Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) resources, direct and indirect Software Composition Analysis (SCA) packages, and secrets declared in code.

This comprehensive visibility allows you to gain valuable insights into the various components of your engineering environment, enabling enhanced analysis, monitoring security and implementation of tailored security measures. It ensures that you can prioritize and address critical risks without disrupting your engineering processes. This ensures a complete understanding and security posture of your organization’s engineering ecosystem. On average it takes engineering teams more than 120 days (4 months) to fix and redeploy code after a vulnerability is identified. 

// Application Security helps address cloud infrastructure misconfigurations in code before they become alerts or incidents. 

// * Integrate Prisma Cloud with widely used IDEs like GitHub to secure your applications by design. Developers opening a PR see their issues flagged in red and are offered suggested code fixes inline that they can easily commit and update. This enables you to address vulnerabilities at the source and secure your supply chain by fixing code errors in context. 

// * Application Security also gives you instant feedback and options for immediate resolutions to your scanned misconfigurations. It flags IaC misconfigurations suggesting code fixes in the developers tooling reducing costly context switching and proactively preventing misconfigurations from occuring.
