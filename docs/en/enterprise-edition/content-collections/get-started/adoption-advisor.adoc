== Adoption Advisor

// Review your adoption of Prisma Cloud, and identify the recommended tasks for your adoption journey.

Adoption Advisor provides guidance through the three stages of the code to cloud application lifecycle: Code & Build, Deploy, and Run. It helps you navigate the Foundational, Intermediate, and Advanced tasks at each stage of the application lifecycle, and adopt the security capabilities at your own pace. You can also use the Adoption Advisor console to generate and manage PDF reports for adoption progress and widget data from the previous 30, 60, or 90 days.

On your code to cloud journey the checks in the Code & Build, Deploy, and Run phases of the application, provide you with: 

* Visibility and control within your Code & Build processes is critical to identify vulnerabilities and compliance violations before progressing to the next phase of the application’s lifecycle. 
+
In this phase, you are responsible for the secure operation of your cloud services. As an example, you use Infrastructure as code (IaC) templates to deploy, maintain, and remove cloud services such as VMs, storage buckets. Visibility and control at this stage enables your developers to proactively harden open source dependencies and IaC by identifying vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and secrets before they are compiled into applications or deployed as insecure cloud services.
And you also may have Continuous Integration (CI) practices to rapidly and continuously develop, update, and maintain your cloud-based applications. The assembly and testing of your code into usable software packages are automated by CI systems such as Jenkins, CircleCI that integrate with the different code repositories and package management systems. These CI systems produce deployable artifacts, such as IaC, VM images, Docker images, Serverless Images, that are consumed by the release processes to drive frequent deployments and support agile development.


* Ability to identify vulnerability and compliance issues within the Deploy phase when applications that are staged for deployment in your continuous cycle of development, testing, and release, or Continous Development pipelines. At this stage, you can enforce policies to ensure only trusted applications are allowed to launch within the cloud runtime environment. 

* Predictive and threat-based protections to secure your Runtime environments. In this stage, you can detect and remediate overly permissive cloud access roles that present opportunities for attackers, identify expected patterns/behavior in runtime actions of applications and resources and prevents anomalous activity. 

The *Adoption Advisor* includes all the security capabilties available from the different subscriptions that include Visibility. Compliance, Governbance for Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), and Cloud Application Security (CAS), Cloud Identity and Access Management (CIEM), and Data Security capabilities on Prisma Cloud. For completing some of these checks, the subscription must be activated first. 

And to help you set your pace, the tasks in the Adoption Advisor are grouped as:

* Foundational – Your organization has started its cloud adoption journey. You are presented with the challenge of effectively managing assets within the cloud and on-premises. Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition provides your organization with the visibility, tools, and knowledge to develop a strong and secure cloud adoption foundation. 

* Intermediate – As you progress with understanding and adopting cloud-based technologies beyond the traditional infrastructure as a service (IaaS) architecture, Prisma Cloud enables you to effectively manage the vulnerabilities and compliance of your cloud resources. 

* Advanced – In this phase, your organization is innovating its business with the cloud, and this is supported by the industry-leading capabilities of Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition. Use Prisma Cloud to proactively control your cloud operations, and identify and remediate issues before they manifest within your runtime environments.

=== How do I Use the Adoption Advisor

Use the Adoption Advisor for visibility on how much of the security capabilities your organization has adopted, uncover security capabilities that you have not yet explored so that you can make the most of your investment, and for guidance on where to take action for maintaining good security hygiene in a particular area and managing risk as you adopt the cloud for critical infrastructure. As your teams complete the recommended tasks, the *Adoption Progress* indicator depicts your progress as a percentage. 

//The IAM Security  checks provide governance and visibility into the entitlements—various permissions and policies— across your cloud resources.

//The Data Security checks help you address the challenge of discovering and protecting data stored in your public cloud storage buckets.

|NAME
|DESCRIPTION


|*Adoption Progress*
|Depicts how well your team has been using the full complement of Prisma Cloud capabilities. This percentage is a ratio of the number of tasks completed divided by the total number of tasks available to you. As your cloud footprint grows, use the Adoption Advisor to identify where to focus on your journey to strengthen your cloud security posture.


|*Anomalous Threats Detected*
|Anomalous Threats Detected are organized by UEBA and Network-based anomaly alerts and policies. The top row displays the number of threats detected for UEBA and Network for the past 30/60/90 days. The bottom row displays the number of enabled vs. possible policies.


|*Discovered vs Secured Resources*
|Displays the extent to which the Defender is currently protecting your cloud environment. It shows the number of resources detected by Cloud Discovery as well as the number of Secured resources protected by deployed Defenders over a period of time.


|*Assets with Urgent Alerts*
|Displays the count of critical and high severity risks detected for all policy violations such as Network, Anomaly, Audit Event, and Config policies by a tenant and the assets producing these alerts over a period of time. It also shows you the Alert Remediation count that includes remediation action states of resolve, dismiss or snooze.


|*Incident Burndown*
