== Data Inventory

The Data Inventory (menu:Inventory[Data]) provides information on the number of assets being monitored and summary of data cards that provide status on how objects are exposed—public, sensitive, or malware, along with a detailed inventory view of objects across accounts, account groups, assets, objects, and regions. It also provides a number of filters such as Time Range, Asset Name, Asset Exposure, Object Profile, Object Pattern to find the specific assets or objects they are interested in.
