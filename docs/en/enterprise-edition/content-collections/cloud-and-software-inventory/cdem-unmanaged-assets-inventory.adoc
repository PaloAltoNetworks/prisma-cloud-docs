You can use this information to gain valuable insights into your publicly exposed assets and enhance your security posture.

. To make your exploration even more efficient, use the following filters:
+
* *Date Filter*: Set it to *Most Recent* to view the latest state of the exposed assets inventory or select *Custom* for any date within the last 90 days.

* *Asset Type Filter*: Apply this filter to view various types of scanned assets, such as *Domain* and *Responsive IPs*.

* *Exposed Service Filter*: Narrow your search to specific types of services running on the exposed assets, such as HTTP servers, RDP servers, and more.

. Select the link in each row to be redirected to the *Exposed Assets* view for a deeper insight into the selected asset. Within the Exposed Assets view, you will find the following tabs containing detailed asset information:
+
* *Overview*: This is the default tab providing a comprehensive overview of the selected asset, including details such as server name, resource type, expiry date, and so on.

* *Exposed Service*: Displays the list of exposed services that are running on the selected asset, such as HTTP servers and other relevant services. Select a listed service to access granular information on the *IPs* and *Certificates* associated with it.

* *Findings*: Displays findings which are security issues, including vulnerabilities discovered on the asset. If you have vulnerability information for the asset from Prisma Cloud and third-party sources, the findings from Prisma Cloud are prioritized and displayed.
