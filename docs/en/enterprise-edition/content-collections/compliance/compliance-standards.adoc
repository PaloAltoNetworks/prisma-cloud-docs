== Compliance Standards
// Review the supported built-in standards.

Prisma Cloud Compliance provides a snapshot of your overall compliance posture across various compliance standards.

Use *Compliance > Standards* to oversee the risk across all the supported cloud platforms and gauge the effectiveness of the security processes and controls you have implemented to keep your enterprise secure. In addition to the built-in standards, if you want to create a custom standard, combine the out-of-the-box policies along with any custom policies to implement your internal cloud security and compliance standards and policies. This custom standard is also displayed on this Compliance Standards page and the *Created By*  is attributed to you.

Review the list of all the built-in and custom standards that you may have defined to monitor and audit your organization’s performance. Each row in the table includes a description of a standard and the total number of policies that map to the standard. It also includes the total number of unique resources monitored for that standard, the pass and fail count of the resources that passed the compliance checks. For each failed check, the severity of the issue affects where it is counted. For example, if a resource fails a high severity policy, it is not counted towards a medium or low failure even if it fails a medium or low severity policy rule.

To learn about each compliance standard, the requirements/sections that it comprises and the policies that map to each requirement, use the links in the compliance standard name in each row. You can also search by the name to filter the data and view information about the selected compliance standard only.

[NOTE]
====
* Prisma Cloud provides policies for risk assessment that map to compliance standards, and a larger set of policies that enable prevention or detection of security risks to which your cloud assets are exposed.
Anomaly policies are an example of policies that are typically not a part of compliance standards, and these policies inform you of actions performed on your cloud assets by entities that are users, services, or IAM roles that have authorization to access and modify your cloud assets, but the entities are not cloud assets.

* Unlike the Asset Inventory that aggregates all your resources and displays the pass and fail count for all monitored resources, the Compliance standards only display the results for monitored resources that match the policies included within a compliance standard. For example, even if you have 30 AWS Redshift instances, if none of the compliance standards include policies that check the configuration or compliance and security standards for Redshift instances, the 30 Redshift instances are not included in the resource count. The results on the table therefore, help you focus your attention on the gaps in compliance for a standard or regulation that is important to you.

To help you easily identify the gaps and measure how you're doing against the compliance standards, create a custom xref:../dashboards/create-and-manage-dashboards.adoc[dashboard] with the compliance widgets. You can also xref:new-compliance-report.adoc[create compliance reports] and run them immediately, or schedule them on a recurring basis to measure your compliance over time.
