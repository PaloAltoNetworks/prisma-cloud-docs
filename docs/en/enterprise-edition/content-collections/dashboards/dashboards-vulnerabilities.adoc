== Vulnerabilities Dashboard

Prisma Cloud *Vulnerabilities Dashboard* gives you a holistic graphical view of all the vulnerabilities across your Code to Cloud environment.
An overview of the top impacting CVEs enables you to prioritize vulnerabilities based on existing risks and trace them from runtime back to the source.
This risk assessment capability helps you to make informed decisions with findings and fix the vulnerable package or base image in code so that you remediate the root cause and resolve the issue when the build is next executed.

The dashboard helps you answer:

//* What is total count of vulnerable assets across my entire application lifecycle?
* What are all the vulnerable assets across my entire application lifecycle?
//* Where should I focus to find and fix the vulnerabilities? I want to know what is urgent, patchable?
* Where should I focus to find and fix the vulnerabilities? What are the critical and urgent ones, and the ones that are patchable?
* What actions can I take to remediate or mitigate the vulnerabilities in Code or Cloud?

// rewrite the section above as a paragraph. the main gist to convey is

//This section helps you to:
//
//* Get an overview of the vulnerability trends across your workload.
//** Get a report of all your compute assets' vulnerabilities.
//** View the trend of vulnerabilities fixed and closed over a defined period of time (say, month, and year).
//* Trace vulnerabilities in runtime to the code that introduced it.
//* Narrow down your search to identify what are the important/critical vulnerabilities.
//* View the vulnerabilities that are patchable and have a fix action item to remediate.
//* Identify what assets are affected by a known vulnerability and where the vulnerable assets are used in your application lifecycle.
//** Assess if your container images have vulnerabilities using a CI scan (Jenkins, Shell).
//** Check if any of your container registries, Host VM images, deployed containers, or Serverless functions have vulnerabilities.
//
//* Access the impact of the vulnerability on the assets (Risk assessment).
//** Pick the most impacted vulnerability with the highest CVE score and explore remediation options.
//** Identify if one of the compute assets is vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-XXXX.
//** Or find vulnerabilities equal to CVE-XXXX-XXXX.
//* Review the CVE (or assets) for threat details and explore the remediation options.
//** Remediate the vulnerabilities at runtime and create a PR to fix the vulnerability at the source.
//** What vulnerabilities to fix and how to fix for container images or hosts?

=== Discover Vulnerabilities

On *Dashboard > Vulnerabilities* you can discover all the vulnerabilities across your environment.
Let's say, there are 1.4K vulnerabilities in your environment out of which only 16997 are critical and high, 2697 are exploitable, out of which 2636 are patchable meaning these vulnerabilities are actionable for you to fix them. The funnel in the Prioritized Vulnerabilities further narrows down to just 5 vulnerable packages that are in use in the runtime that you can focus on.

**Prerequisites**

* xref:../connect/connect-cloud-accounts/connect-cloud-accounts.adoc[Onboard Cloud accounts].
* xref:../application-security/get-started/connect-code-and-build-providers/code-repositories/code-repositories.adoc[Onboard code repositories].
//* Onboard registries <link> and workloads for vulnerability scanning.
* xref:../runtime-security/vulnerability-management/registry-scanning/configure-registry-scanning.adoc[Configure registry scans].
* Enable xref:../governance/workload-protection-policies.adoc[*Workload Incident* and *Workload Vulnerability* policies].

The following visualizations are available for you to help contextualize risks from vulnerabilities:

- **Vulnerabilities Overview** - Provides a summarized view of the total vulnerabilities in your environment further divided into Vulnerabilities by Asset and Vulnerabilities that have already been remediated, allowing you to track and share your progress in securing your environment.
Visualize the trends with *Total Vulnerable Assets*, and their metadata, *Total Vulnerabilities Remediated*, and *Total Vulnerabilities* count in the current snapshot.

- **Prioritized Vulnerabilities** - Discover all the vulnerabilities across your workloads and identify the top-priority vulnerabilities (aggregated vulnerabilities that are urgent, exploitable, patchable, and vulnerable packages in use).
+
The vulnerabilities sourced from Compute and CAS (Cloud App Sec) are prioritized and aggregated based on the most urgent, exploitable, patchable, and vulnerable packages in use. This prioritization helps you to identify the top-priority vulnerabilities to focus on.
//The vulnerabilities data sources are:
//Current Ph1:
//- Compute
//- CAS (Cloud App Sec)
//Ph2: (Third parties)
//- Qualys
//- Tenable
//- AWS Inspector
+
The aggregation is based on vulnerabilities that are:
+
- Urgent: Critical, High
- Exploitable: Exploit in the Wild and Exploit in POC
- Patchable: Vulnerabilities that are actionable and have a patch to fix or mitigate.
- Vulnerable packages in use

- **Top Impacting Vulnerabilities** - Provides a ranked list of the most critical vulnerabilities in your environment based on the risk score. The ranked list consists of CVEs affecting the environment. Each CVE includes data about its risk factors, severity, CVSS, risk factors, and assets impacted.
+
Review the top-impacting vulnerabilities based on the CVE severity, CVSS score, Risk Factors, and the assets impacted across your CI/CD pipeline.

- **Vulnerability Impact by Stage** - Visualize the sources of the vulnerabilities and the impact of the vulnerability across app stages of your application lifecycle. Trace vulnerabilities from runtime back to the repositories they originate from.
+
At each stage, you can select and investigate any of the impacted assets such as Packages, Images in IaC Files, Host VM Images, Registry Images, Deployed Images, Serverless Functions, and Hosts.
This makes it easier for you to trace back the packages and images that were used to build a workload that is now vulnerable in the deploy stage, or runtime.

[#prioritize-assess-risk]
=== Prioritize and Assess Risk

Once you get a summarized view of all the discovered vulnerabilities, the dashboard helps you to narrow down to the most important and critical vulnerabilities to focus on.

Following are the paths you take to investigate and assess risk across the CBDR graph:

[#remediate-vulnerabilities]
=== Remediate or Mitigate Vulnerabilities

//What can I do to fix the vulnerabilities in the code or fix them at runtime?
As you access the vulnerability Overview, Top Impacting Vulnerabilities, and Vulnerability Impact by Stage, you can now explore the remediation options.
//<gif>

[.procedure]
[#remediate-cve]

. Select *Dashboard > Vulnerabilities*.
.. Select a vulnerability from any of the entry paths on the dashboard. Refer to the possible entry paths in xref:prioritize-assess-risk[prioritize and assess risks].
. In the CBDR graph under *Investigate*, click on a vulnerable *CVE > View Details*.
+
The CVE side panel gives you an overview of the CVE with its CVSS score, the impacted stages, severity, risk factors, the package name, and the distros affected by this CVE.
//+
//Let's say, you want to investigate a specific CVE that is critical, exploitable, has a patch, and is affecting the runtime instances.
+
image::dashboards/uve-remediate-cve.gif[]

. *Remediate or Mitigate a CVE*
+
In the CVE side panel, you can either remediate or create a Jira ticket:

.. Select *Remediate > Submit Pull Request* for all packages and IaC files impacted by this vulnerability across all repositories.
//We need to call out expected behaviors (what happens when an user submits a PR for a group of packages or if no repository is onboarded?) from an UX/UI perspective.
.. *Send To > Jira* to create a Jira ticket with all the vulnerability details of the deployed images, registry images, and hosts.
+
*Select Template** from the available ones, or add a new integration template under *Settings > Integrations & Notifications*.
//** Enter an *Assignee* for the Jira ticket.
+
Select *Send*.
+
//<add-note-for-RLP-110563?focusedCommentId=784561>
Note: *Dashboard > Vulnerabilities* shows a total count of all the vulnerabilities across all the distro releases in your workload, which is higher than the total count of only the CVEs affecting your assets shown under *Investigate > Search*.
+
For example, when multiple vulnerabilities are attached to a single CVE, the vulnerability search shows a total count of only the CVEs impacted by these vulnerabilities.

. *Assess the impact on an Asset and take action*
.. In the CVE side panel select *Assets*.
+
This lists all the assets affected by this CVE from the packages and IaC files in code & build to the images in the registry that are being deployed to the runtime as Hosts, Containers, and Serverless functions.
+
You can filter the assets based on *Risk Factors*, download all asset configurations, or take mitigation actions per asset type.
//.. Expand each asset in the CBDR stage and select *View Details*.
//+
//In assets' side panel review the assets for threat details, alerts, vulnerabilities, process info, package info, labels, and view assets' configuration.
//For example, with attack path analysis, you can assess a weak host that is internet exposed, has vulnerabilities and has access to PII (credit card), and see the policies violated that generated these findings.
+
Following are the actions available for each asset type:
