== Select and Deploy Defenders

To use the the agent-based security features provided by Prisma Cloud, you must deploy Defender agents. Prisma Cloud supports deploying single Defenders for containers, hosts, and serverless functions or deploying Defenders on entire clusters using an orchestrator.

Start with *Runtime Security* on the Prisma Cloud switcher. Select, deploy, and manage your Defenders.
