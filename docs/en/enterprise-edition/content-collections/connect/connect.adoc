== Connect

Manage your providers to get full coverage of the cloud accounts and code and build providers that you can scan, secure, and connect to Prisma Cloud. To begin monitoring the assets on your cloud infrastructure, you must first connect your providers to Prisma Cloud. 

//When you add your cloud account to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between your cloud infrastructure provider and Prisma Cloud is established and you can begin monitoring the resources and identify potential security risks in your infrastructure.
