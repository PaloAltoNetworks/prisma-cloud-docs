== Add an Alibaba Cloud Account on Prisma Cloud

Add your Alibaba Cloud account to Prisma Cloud to start monitoring the resources in the account.

After creating a RAM role with permissions that allow Prisma Cloud programmatic access to your cloud resources on Alibaba Cloud, the next step is to add the account you want to monitor for changes on the cloud infrastructure.
