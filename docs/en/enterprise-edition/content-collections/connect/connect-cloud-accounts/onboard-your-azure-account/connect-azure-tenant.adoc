== Connect your Azure Tenant 

Learn how to <<commercial>>, <<government>>, or <<china>> on Prisma Cloud. Onboarding an *Azure Tenant* connects all your Azure assets to Prisma Cloud including Accounts with Management Groups, Subscriptions, and Active Directory.

Connecting Prisma Cloud to your Azure cloud account enables you to analyze and monitor traffic logs, and detect potential malicious network activity or compliance issues. During the built-in onboarding process you have the option of using one of the following three methods to create the required Azure assets to authorize Prisma Cloud to access Azure APIs:

* xref:authorize-prisma-cloud.adoc#terraform[Terraform] (Recommended)
This workflow automates the process of setting up the Prisma Cloud application on Azure Active Directory and enables read-only or read-write access to your Azure subscription.
+
[NOTE]
====
Azure China workflows do not support the use of Terraform templates.
====
* xref:authorize-prisma-cloud.adoc#json[Using Custom Role JSON]
Using a manually created Custom Role you also have the option to enforce least access privilege to restrict access. To achieve this you will need to manually set up the Prisma Cloud application on Active Directory and Create a Custom Role to authorize access to Azure APIs. 
* xref:authorize-prisma-cloud.adoc#manual[Manually Authorizing Prisma Cloud]
If your organization restricts the use of Terraform scripts, you can choose to manually create the required Azure assets for Prisma Cloud to call the Azure APIs.

.. Choose *Azure* as the *Cloud to Secure*.
.. Select *Tenant* under *Scope*.
.. Select *Commercial* as the *Deployment Type*.
.. Enable the following *Advanced* security capabilities to optimize your Prisma Cloud experience:
+
* xref:../../../runtime-security/agentless-scanning/agentless-scanning.adoc[Agentless Workload Scanning] scans hosts and containers for vulnerabilities and compliance risks without having to install a Defender. You can also update the scanning xref:../../../runtime-security/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts/onboard-accounts.adoc[configuration] for Agentless scans.

* *Serverless Function Scanning* scans cloud provider functions like AWS Lambda, Azure and Google functions for xref:../../../runtime-security/vulnerability-management/scan-serverless-functions.adoc[vulnerabilities] and xref:../../../runtime-security/compliance/visibility/serverless.adoc[compliance]. You can also update the xref:../../../runtime-security/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts/onboard-accounts.adoc[scanning] configuration for Serverless scans

* *Agent-Based Workload Protection* allows for automated deployment of Defenders to secure assets such as xref:../../../runtime-security/install/deploy-defender/host/auto-defend-host.adoc[VMs], xref:../../../runtime-security/install/deploy-defender/container/container.adoc[containers], and xref:../../../runtime-security/install/deploy-defender/kubernetes/kubernetes.adoc[Kubernetes orchestrators]. Registry scanning, Kubernetes audits and other features required by defenders are also enabled.
+
NOTE: Once you select *Agentless Workload Scanning* and *Serverless Function Scanning*, the *Organization Scan* toggle is available. Toggle it *On* to scan all accounts linked to the tenant. 

* *Threat Detection* to identify network and user threats is enabled by default.

[NOTE] 
====
The following recommended capabilities are enabled by default:

* *Misconfigurations* (Foundational) scans cloud assets and ingestion metadata for vulnerabilities.
* *Identity Security* (Foundational) calculates net effective permission for identities and manages access.
* *Threat Detection* (Advanced) identifies network and user threats.
