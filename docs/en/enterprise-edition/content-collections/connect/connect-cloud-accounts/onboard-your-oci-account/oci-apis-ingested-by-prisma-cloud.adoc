List of all the OCI APIs and their permissions that Prisma Cloud supports for your OCI-related resources.

====
It is recommended that you update your existing Terraform template to support the new permissions. This new Terraform template update eliminates the need to contact OCI to request a service limit extension for the policy statements.
