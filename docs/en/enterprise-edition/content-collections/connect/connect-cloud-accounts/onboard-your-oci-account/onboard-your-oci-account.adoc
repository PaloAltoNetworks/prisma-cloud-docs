== Onboard Your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Account
Use Prismaâ„¢ Cloud for monitoring and identifying compliance violations of all the resources deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

To begin monitoring your resources on OCI, you must complete some tasks on the OCI Tenant Console and some on Prisma Cloud. After you add your OCI tenant to Prisma Cloud, the API integration between OCI and Prisma Cloud is established and you can monitor resource configuration issues using RQL and alerts.

Prisma Cloud supports ingestion of Configuration logs to identify OCI resource configuration issues. OCI network logs and event logs are not currently ingested.
