== Generate Reports on Prisma Cloud Alerts
Generate reports on open alerts on Prisma Cloud.

You can generate two types of reports on alerts—Cloud Security Assessment report and Business Unit report. These reports enable you to inform your stakeholders on the status of the cloud assets and how they are doing against Prisma Cloud security and compliance policy checks. Sharing the reports on a regular basis enables them to monitor progress without requiring access to the Prisma Cloud administrator console.

The Cloud Security Assessment report is a PDF report that summarizes the risks from open alerts in the monitored cloud accounts for a specific cloud type. The report includes an executive summary and a list of policy violations, including a page with details for each policy that includes the description and the compliance standards that are associated with it, the number of resources that passed and failed the check within the specified time period.

The Business Unit report is a .csv file that includes the total number of resources that have open alerts against policies for any compliance standard, and you can generate the report on-demand or on a recurring schedule. You can opt to create an overview report which shows you how you’re doing across all your business units, or get a little more granular about each of the cloud accounts you want to monitor. You can also generate the Business Unit report to review policy violations that are associated with specific compliance standards.

The overview report lists cloud resources by account group and aggregates information about the number of resources failing and the failure percentage against each policy. Whereas, the detailed Business Unit report lists cloud resources by account group, account name, and account ID, and it includes information about the number of resources failing against each policy and the status of cloud resources that have been scanned against that policy. The status can be pass or fail, and the status is reported as pass it means that the count of resources that failed the policy check is zero.
