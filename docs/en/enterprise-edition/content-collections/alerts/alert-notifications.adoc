== Alerts and Notifications on Prisma Cloud 
//Learn how to use Prisma™ Cloud alerts and notifications to efficiently analyze security risks and findings across all of your cloud environments.


In your journey to achieving zero breach, zero risks, and zero blind spots, you need to quickly find issues, triage and fix them to minimize the impact to your cloud estate. Prisma Cloud provides continuous monitoring for cloud environments so that you have the visibility and opportunity to take action at the right stage of the code to cloud lifecycle. It correlates configuration data with user behavior and network traffic to provide context around misconfigurations and threats in the form of actionable alerts.

Upon onboarding your cloud account, Prisma Cloud immediately starts monitoring and correlating data. For alerts to be generated, it's essential for the cloud account to be part of an account group and be associated with an alert rule specifying which policy violations should trigger alerts. To make it easy, Prisma Cloud offers default account groups and alert rules that use out-of-the-box policies to scan for violations and generate alerts. You can view the alerts on *Alerts*.

For effective security, it's essential to address alerts promptly. Sometimes this means fixing issues in the runtime resource immediately, while at other times, you need to fix it during the code-and-build phase prior to deployment.

To assist in alert prioritization, Prisma offers default *Views* that include an Overview, along with a prioritized set of the highest fidelity alerts that need you attention such as Incidents, Risky Attack Paths,Vulnerabilities for your monitored cloud accounts. You can filter based on the most important alert criteria to create your own xref:view-respond-to-prisma-cloud-alerts.adoc#create-views[Views].
