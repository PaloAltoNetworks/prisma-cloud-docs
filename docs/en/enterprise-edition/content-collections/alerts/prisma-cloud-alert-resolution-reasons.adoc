== Prisma Cloud Alert Resolution Reasons
Review the different reasons an alert is closed on Prisma Cloud

When an open alert is resolved, the reason that was alert was closed is included to help with audits. The reason is displayed in the response object in the API, and on the Prisma Cloud administrative console on menu:Alerts[Overview] when you select an resolved alert and review the alert details for the violating resource.

The table below lists the reasons:

+++<draft-comment>RLP-49067</draft-comment>+++
|As a result of some Prisma Cloud scanning engine optimizations, some of the *Open* and *Resolved* alerts were updated with the reason *Scheduled*. This was done inadvertently, is not related to a change in the cloud resource that triggered the alert, and will be addressed with a fix in an upcoming release.
For IAM alerts, *Scheduled* is the the only supported reason.
