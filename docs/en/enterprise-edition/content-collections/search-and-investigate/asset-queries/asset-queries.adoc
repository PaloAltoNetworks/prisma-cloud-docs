== Asset Queries

Use asset queries to search for all your cloud assets based on comprehensive security findings and vulnerabilities.

With the Investigate in simple mode powered by asset RQL grammar, you can search for assets based on asset attributes and security contexts from across Prisma Cloud in one place, create custom policies for risky assets, and understand your cloud environments better.

By default, Prisma Cloud System Administrator has Asset search permission. You need to enable corresponding capabilities to have access to the full suite of security findings for running an asset search.

NOTE: Asset search is not supported for on-premises workloads.
