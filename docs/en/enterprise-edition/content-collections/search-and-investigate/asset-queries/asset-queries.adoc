== Asset Queries

Use asset queries to search for all your cloud assets based on comprehensive security findings and vulnerabilities.

With the Investigate in simple mode powered by asset RQL grammar, you can search for assets based on asset attributes and security contexts from across Prisma Cloud in one place, and you can create custom policies for risky assets and understand your cloud environments better.

NOTE: Asset search is not supported for on-premises workloads.
