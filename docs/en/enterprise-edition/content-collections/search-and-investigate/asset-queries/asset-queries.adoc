== Asset Queries

Use asset queries to search for all your cloud assets based on comprehensive security findings and vulnerabilities.

With Investigate in simple mode, you can search for assets based on asset attributes and security contexts from across Prisma Cloud in one place, create custom policies for risky assets, and understand your cloud environments better. By default, Prisma Cloud System Administrator has Asset search permission. 

//RLP-118673 and RLP-119856 with 23.11.1

The `asset where` queries display results only for cloud accounts that you have onboarded to Prisma Cloud. Due to this, the number of vulnerabilities displayed on selecting xref:../../dashboards/dashboards-vulnerabilities.adoc[Dashboard > Vulnerabilities] differs from that displayed on Investigate. If you have non-onboarded cloud accounts—such as those that are included in Account Groups with an Account ID reference or you had previously onboarded on *Compute > Cloud Accounts* using account credentials, or have cloud accounts where you have deployed Defenders but the account itself is not being monitored on Prisma Cloud—the `asset where` queries will not include the assets in the search results. If you want to view these assets, you must xref:../../connect/connect-cloud-accounts/connect-cloud-accounts.adoc[add the cloud account] on Prisma Cloud.
