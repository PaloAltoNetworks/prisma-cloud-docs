== Asset Configuration Queries

Use asset configuration queries to investigate configuration incidents so that you can identify misconfigurations and compliance violations.

Prisma Cloud ingests various services and associated configuration data from AWS, Azure, Alibaba, GCP, and OCI cloud services. You can retrieve asset information to identify asset misconfigurations and detect policy violations that expose your business to undue risk and non-compliance to industry benchmarks. You can also view the audit trail for information on who created, modified, deleted assets on the cloud platform and when the change was made.

To investigate asset configuration issues, you can use Asset Config queries. You can enter your query in the *Search* bar and if the search expression is valid and complete, a green check mark displays along with your query results.

You can choose to save the search queries that you have created for investigating incidents in *My Saved Searches*. A saved search enables you to use the same query at a later time, instead of typing the query again, and it enables you to use the saved search to create a policy. 

*Saved Searches* has list of search queries saved by any Prisma Cloud administrator.

Select a record to view additional details about Audit Trail or Host Findings in the Asset Explorer. Hover over the configuration record to see the option to view the details of the asset configuration. You can also search directly within the JSON asset configuration to easily find something that is part of the metadata ingested on Prisma Cloud, and speed up your investigation.
