== Launch Your Query

*Investigate* provides a quick and simple option to launch your queries. You get out-of-the-box visibility and risk prioritization filtering with minimal learning.

Before you write a custom query, you can view the queries you recently searched or use one of the top saved queries that allow you to take advantage of the rich set of AI-powered security research provided by Prisma Cloud. You can choose to either create a new search or directly load a query from the *Query Library* (search suggestions) and view the search results in the interactive graph view (default, when available depending on the query type) or the table view. 

You can launch a query using any of the following methods:

[.procedure]

. Select *Investigate > Search*.

.. Choose from the *Recent Searches* that display the most recent query search results along with the query title and the timestamp for when it was run. 
.. You can view up to 5 pages and each page lists 10 recent searches. 
.. *Saved Searches* displays the top 10 most popular queries along with query title, who created it (author), and a description of the query.
.. Select any query listed under *Recent Searches* or *Saved Queries* to see the details in graph or table format. 
.. With additional keywords you get more details on what you want to investigate. The blinking asset node guides you to view the asset and you can then expand your query by adding additional findings.

.. Enter your query, for example `show publicly exposed EC2 instances`. 
.. As you start typing the query in plain English, Prisma Cloud matches your query keywords with the top saved queries and displays the most relevant results. Hover over a result to view complete details.

.. Select any query to see the graph.
.. Select any query type, such as *Asset*, *Asset Configuration*, *Application Asset*, *Vulnerability*, *Permissions*, *Network Configuration*, *Network*, or *Audit Event*, to view queries specific to that query type. 

. Select *Search* to build a query from scratch. 

.. Select a query type, for example *Asset* from the drop-down.
