== Search and Investigate 

Your cloud security teams perform in-depth analysis and investigation of security issues within your cloud applications and infrastructure. Using *Investigate* you can get answers to questions related to security risks and incidents from *Code to Cloud* with a simple and intuitive point-and-click interface that is powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP). The keyword search provides a curated list of results with rich visualization. You can then drill down the results to explore data, modify and save the query, create custom policies and receive alerts within minutes of a policy violation.

Use *Investigate > Search* to find the latest security incidents identified in your cloud environment and explore what risk factors could have contributed to the incident, for example:

* Which are the EC2 instances that have risky ports open to the internet, have overly permissive IAM permissions, and contain critical vulnerabilities?
* Are there any S3 buckets with encryption disabled?
* Are there any virtual machines that are directly accessible from the internet?
* Which cloud resources have exploitable vulnerabilities that need to be patched?
* Which assets in your cloud environment are impacted by the latest log5j vulnerability?
