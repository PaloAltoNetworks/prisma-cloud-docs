== Query Library and Background Jobs

The *Query Library* displays all of your saved queries in one location. After you run a query, you can save the query as a *Saved Query* so that you can re-run the same search periodically. If you then use this saved query as a match criteria in a policy, the matched issues that trigger alerts can be different from the corresponding results for the same query on the *Investigate* page.

You can run an asynchronous search in the background and check results later. *Background Jobs* displays those results in a table format. From here you can download the results (.csv), add the query to a policy, save the query, and open the query to view or modify it further.
