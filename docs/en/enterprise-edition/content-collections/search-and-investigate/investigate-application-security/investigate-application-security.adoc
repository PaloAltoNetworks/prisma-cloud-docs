== Investigate Application Security

Application Security *Investigate* enables you to view your software development life cycle (SLDC) as a graphical representation, allowing you to explore assets and connections, including data collected by Prisma Cloud from system environments and subscribed modules.

This visibility allows you to perform an in-depth analysis of security issues across your entire engineering ecosystem. You can digest and understand the assets in your environment, and the relationships between them.
