== Build Queries

[.procedure]

. Before you begin building a query, you must understand the basic building blocks of a query.
+
* *[FIND]*: The category of investigation 
* *[Type]*: The asset or node in your engineering environment
* *[WHERE]* clause: An attribute representing the relationship or edge between the nodes
* *[+ADD]*: Create an additional clause 

. Access Application Security query builder: 
+
In Application Security, select *Investigate* > *Search* > select the *Application Asset* domain from the 'Find' menu.
. Select a type.
. In the *[WHERE]* clause, select an attribute or a more complex condition such as a relationship between two nodes.
+
NOTE: When selecting an attribute, the auto-suggest feature will suggest applicable expressions and operators that you can use to narrow your search criteria. 

. Add clauses as required: select *+ Add*.
. Create the query: select *Search*.
. Next step: xref:explore-query-results.adoc[Analyze query results].
+
NOTE: See xref:application-asset-examples.adoc[Investigate Query Examples] for examples.

=== Explore Query Results

After building your query, you can analyze the results to perform an in-depth analysis of security issues across your entire engineering ecosystem.

The query result, displayed in *Graph View*, includes the following components:
* <<nodes-,Nodes>>: The assets of a repository. Can include entities
* <<edges-,Edges>>: The connections between nodes
* *Export*: Download graph data as a png image or JSON file
* *Controls*: Include zoom and reset

See the ../../../../application-security/visibility/repositories.adoc#appgraph[Application Graph]for more on exploring graphs, including nodes and edges.

NOTE: See xref:investigate-examples.adoc[Application Asset query examples].






== Asset Query Attributes

Learn about Asset query attributes.

Review your options when using userinput:[asset where]. Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. As you use these attributes, the auto-suggestion feature shows the available expressions and the operators that are applicable for each attribute.

*  userinput:[asset.name] 
+
Use the userinput:[asset.name] attribute to view asset details on the *Investigate* tab.
+
For example, you can <details>.
+
screen:[example]


*  userinput:[asset.class] 
+
Use the userinput:[asset.class] attribute to view .
+
For example, you can <details>.
+
screen:[example]


*  userinput:[asset.type] 
+
Use the userinput:[asset.type] attribute to view .
+
For example, you can <details>.
+
screen:[example]


*  userinput:[asset.category] 
+
Use the userinput:[asset.category] attribute to view .
+
For example, you can <details>.
+
screen:[example]


*  userinput:[asset.service] 
+
Use the userinput:[asset.service] attribute to view .
+
For example, you can <details>.
+
screen:[example]



* `asset.name`
+
Use `asset.name` to view asset details.

* `asset.class`
+
Use `asset.class` to view the asset class.

*  `asset.type`
+
Use `asset.type` to view .

* `asset.category`
+
Use `asset.category` to view .

* `asset.service`
+
Use `asset.service` to view .
