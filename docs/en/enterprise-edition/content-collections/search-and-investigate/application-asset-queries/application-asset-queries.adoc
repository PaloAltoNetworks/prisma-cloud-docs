== Application Asset Queries

Use *Application Asset* queries to view your software development life cycle (SLDC) as a graphical representation that allows you to explore assets and connections, including data collected by Prisma Cloud from system environments and subscribed modules.

This visibility allows you to perform an in-depth analysis of security issues across your entire engineering ecosystem. You can digest and understand the assets in your environment, and the relationships between them. 

The Application Asset queries are only supported in *Simple Mode*. You cannot save these queries under *Saved Queries* or run *Background Jobs*.
