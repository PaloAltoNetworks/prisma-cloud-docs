== Pre-receive Hooks

Install Prisma Cloud Application Security scanner (Prisma Cloud scanner) as a pre-receive hook into your workflows using Checkov CLI to automate the scanning of your code for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) issues and Secrets vulnerabilities. Pre-receive hooks are server-side hooks in version control systems (VCS) that are triggered on the server when receiving a push or a specific action is performed, and these hooks enable you to enforce checks or actions before accepting any changes into the VCS.

Installing the Prisma Cloud code scanner allows you to identify issues and take remediation steps before accepting the code into your repositories. This mitigates the risk of introducing potential issues downstream.

NOTE: The terminology and implementation of pre-receive hooks may vary across different version control systems such as GitHub and GitLab.

The Prisma Cloud Application Security pre-receive hook is supported on the following systems:

* <<local-host,Local Host>>
* <<github-enterprise-server,GitHub Enterprise Server>>
* <<github-self-managed,GitLab Self-Managed>>

[#local-host]
=== Install Prisma Cloud Scanner as a Pre-Receive Hook on a Local Host

Installing Prisma Cloud scanner as a pre-receive hook on your local host enables early detection of security vulnerabilities before the code is committed to your version control system, reducing downstream impact and enhancing security.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin:
+
* Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python] v3.8 - v3.12
* Install https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]
* Install xref:../../connect-code-and-build-providers/ci-cd-runs/add-checkov.adoc[Checkov]
* Verify _Administrator_ access to the VCS server and console

. Clone the following repository: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov-pre-receive-hooks.

. Navigate to the local folder housing the cloned repository and run the following command to build the image from the `Dockerfile.dev` file:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t pre-receive.dev
----

. Add executable permissions to the `checkov-pre-receive.sh` file:
+
[source,shell]
----
chmod +x prisma-pre-receive.sh
----

. Run a data container with a generated SSH key:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run --name data pre-receive.dev /bin/true
----

. Copy the script to the data container:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker cp prisma-pre-receive.sh data:/home/git/test.git/hooks/pre-receive
----
+
NOTE: See <<pre-receive-hook-script,Pre-receive Hook Script>> for more information.

. Run an application container to execute the hook:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run -d -p 52311:22 --volumes-from data pre-receive.dev
----

. Copy the generated SSH key to your local machine:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker cp data:/home/git/.ssh/id_ed25519
----


. Test the hook: Make a commit in a local repository and run the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
git remote add test git@127.0.0.1:test.git
$ GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 52311 -i ../id_ed25519" git push -u test main
