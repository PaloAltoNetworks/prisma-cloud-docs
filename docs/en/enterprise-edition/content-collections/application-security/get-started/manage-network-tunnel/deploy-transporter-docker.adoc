== Set Up Transporter Network Tunnels using Docker Containers

Setup the Transporter network tunnel using Docker containers.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 
.. Configure your firewall or proxy to allow egress network access for the IP addresses in the allow list
.. xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a key ID and secret
.. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Install Docker]. The Transporter Client requires Docker to be installed in your environment with network access to your self-hosted VCS. 
.. *SSL Certificate and path access*: To establish a secure webhook connection to your VCS, you need to provide Transporter with an SSL certificate. The webhook is established in your environment, so you need to define to the certificate storage path and key
.. Hardware resources: 
+
* For environments where the total size of all scanned repositories is under 4 GB, use a machine with 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM (tested on m5.large EC2 instance)
* For environments where the total size of all scanned repositories is over 4 GB, use a machine with 4 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM (tested on m5.xlarge EC2 instance)

. In Application Security.
.. Select *Home* > *Settings* > *Manage Network Tunnels*.
.. In the *Manage Integrations* step of the installation wizard, select *New Transporter*.
. Fill in the fields that are displayed.
+
* *Transporter Name*: a unique alias. Helps to group and define multiple connections on Prisma Cloud console. The Transporter unique name cannot contain spaces.
* *Transporter URL* and *Port*: The Transporter URL is a proxy URL with a port number you must define. This information will also be used in the Docker files that are configured in Transporter to communicate with Prisma Cloud
* *Prisma Cloud Access Key* and *Prisma Cloud Secret Key*: The Access key ID and secret generated in step 1 above
* *SSL Certificate path* and *SSL Certificate key path*: Specify the paths to the SSL certificate and key in order to use Transporter. Webhooks use the certificate path to integrate with Transporter, and the key path to allow WebSockets to encrypt traffic (communicate over HTTP). Ensure that the path of the certificate is for the specified Transporter client URL and port

. Select *Next*. 

. In the *Deploy Client* step of the wizard.
.. Give Docker the permissions it needs to run: Copy the command from the *Verify and add permissions for set SSL Certificate path* field, and run it in your CLI terminal.
+
NOTE: This command sets the permissions for the SSL certificate and defines the local path to the certificate.
.. Pull the Docker image: Copy the command from the *Docker pull CLI* field and run it in your CLI terminal.
.. Select *Docker commands* or *Docker compose* from the *Run Image* field to run the image and establish communication between Prisma Cloud and your self-hosted VCS. 

NOTE: Use *Docker commands* to create a Docker image that contains the code and configuration for establishing communication between Prisma Cloud and your self-hosted VCS. Then run this image using Docker commands. Use *Docker compose* to define a Docker application that contains the code and configuration for establishing communication between Prisma Cloud and your self-hosted VCS. Then run this application using Docker compose.

* *Using Docker commands* 


** Copy and paste the command from the *Logs volume* command in your terminal to save the Docker logs as a dedicated volume
** Copy and paste the command from the *Docker Run CLI command* in your terminal to run the pulled Docker image

+
*  *Using Docker compose* 

** Copy and paste the content from the *Docker Compose Content* field into your file to create and save docker-compose file content that you can use later
** Copy and paste the command from the *Docker-Compose CLI Command* field in your CLI terminal to run the 'docker-compose' command

Once the connection is established, Transporter will use WebSockets to communicate with each other.
+
NOTE: The `-d` value in the command is used to specify the name of the Docker compose yml file.

.. Select *Next* > *Done* to complete the integration.
+
Only after the Transporter has run successfully can Prisma Cloud authenticate and establish a communication channel with your VCS. 


You can view the integrated Transporter in Application Security through *Home* > *Settings > Manage Network Tunnels > Manage Integrations*.


You can add a new Transporter to an VCS integration in Application Security through *Home* >  *Settings* > *Manage Network Tunnels* > *Manage Integrations* > *New Transporter*.

Adding the Transporter to an integration establishes the communication channel between the VCS and Prisma Cloud. In this example, the GitLab Self-managed integration to Prisma Cloud uses the Transporter.

=== Manage Transporter

You can manage the existing Transporter configuration in Application Security through *Home* > *Settings* > *Manage Network Tunnels* > *Manage Integrations*.
* *Edit* Transporter: Select a Transporter from the menu in the Transporter field > edit required the values in the same manner as the integration process above 
* *Delete* Transporter: Select a Transporter from the menu in the Transporter field > Click *Delete Transporter*

=== Health Check

The health check shows you how many VCS integrations you have and the last time the connection was established. The Transporter runs health checks every hour, but you can also refresh the connection anytime on Prisma Cloud.

Prisma Cloud scans every Transporter configuration for a secure connection. After authenticating the secure connection, you will view the health check of the Transporter.
+
image::application-security/transporter-19.png[]

Prisma cloud supports three types of client health checks:Transporter Client at VCS Domain, Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud Server and Transporter Client in client environment and Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud environment.

==== Transporter Client at VCS Domain

`Route - /internalcheck`

Checks if there is a connection with your VCS machine using Transporter.

* Apply additional headers to a `CURL` command in order to point to the VCS that the check should be applied to:

** `x-forwarded-host`: The VCS machine hostname for the check

** `x-forwarded-path`: The path of the request to send to the VCS machine

** `x-forwarded-proto`: The protocol which to check connectivity on - https or http

=== Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud Server

`Route - /externalcheck`

Checks if there is internet access to Prisma server from the machine. Uses `/login` route with `accessKey` and `secretKey`.

==== Transporter Client in Client Environment and Transporter Client at Prisma Cloud Environment

`Route - /selfcheck`

Checks if the certificates provided are valid for the domain of the machine and runs on request over HTTPS.

`/healthz`, is used for docker `healthcheck` on the internal port of docker `8080`.
+
NOTE: You must run at least 3 test checks before running the Docker image. The responses must be `ok:true` when the checks pass, or `ok:false` when they fail.

[.task]

=== Delete Transporter

Deleting the Transporter is only possible if you have removed existing VCS  integrations with the Transporter.

[.procedure]

. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings > Manage Network Tunnel* > select a specific Transporter name.
. Select *Delete Transporter*.

[.task]

=== Edit Transporter

You can edit the configuration of an existing Transporter.

[.procedure]

. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers* > *Manage Network Tunnel* > select a specific Transporter name.
. Edit the configurations and then select *Next*.
