== Enable Notifications

Prisma Cloud enables you to send notifications for new code and CI/CD security issues detected during periodic scans of your environments to messaging systems that you have integrated with Prisma Cloud. Supported messaging systems include Microsoft Teams, Slack, Splunk, JIRA, ServiceNow notification systems, as well as for webhooks.

NOTE: VCS pull request scans do not initiate notifications, as PR scans already provide notifications within the PR itself in the form of comments. Nevertheless, if a PR is merged and introduces new findings on the default branch, these findings will generate alerts during the next periodic scan.

You must integrate your notification systems before enabling notifications for both code and CI/CD security notifications - see xref:../../../administration/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud.adoc[Configure External Integrations on Prisma Cloud].
