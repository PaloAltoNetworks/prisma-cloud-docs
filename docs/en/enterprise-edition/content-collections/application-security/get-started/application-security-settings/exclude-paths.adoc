== Exclude Paths from Application Security scans

Enhance your Application Security scan by incorporating rules into an integrated repository. These new rules are specifically scanned for a single defined repository. However, you have the flexibility to set up multiple repositories for a defined rule.

By default, Prisma Cloud conducts scans across all paths in all repositories. You can apply a rule to precisely identify which repository paths should be excluded during the scanning process.

//Prior to initiating the rule-addition process, ensure that the default configuration for all repositories is disabled.
//TODO: Anagha to confirm this statement.

. Add paths to exclude from scans.
+
Use comma `(,)` to list more than one path or file.
+
In this example, you see `test, _test, \/test\/` added as paths. During scans any path or file that includes the specified context will not be scanned.
