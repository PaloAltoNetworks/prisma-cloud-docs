|Exclude Paths

Define paths to exclude for scans and specify repositories for targeted applications. This helps in noise reduction and effective prioritization of issues.

//Create Enforcement rules for Code Repositories and CI/CD Runs

//Enforcement rules determine if a build needs to fail when misconfigured or when the code is vulnerable.

| Scan Git History for Secrets

|Enabling Git History scanning empowers you to uncover any secrets that may have been removed from the repository but remain accessible in its history. This ensures a comprehensive security sweep for vulnerabilities in potentially forgotten or overlooked access points. See xref:../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/secrets-scanning.adoc[here] to know more.

| Validate Secrets

|While validating secrets Prima Cloud leverages service provider APIs to meticulously verify the authenticity and integrity of secrets discovered within the codebase. This process serves as a crucial step in prioritizing security measures. By confirming the validity of these secrets, the you can allocate resources and attention to the most pressing security concerns, ensuring a focused and effective approach to safeguarding sensitive information. See xref:../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/secrets-scanning.adoc[here] to know more.

In addition to these configurations you can enable Developer Suppressions. By enabling this configuration, any suppressions specified in the code will be disregarded while a routine and thorough scan of associated resources will continue. This ensures that no potential issues or vulnerabilities are overlooked, bolstering the overall security posture of the system.
