== Non-Default Branch Scans

You can scan branches other than the main or master, such as a feature branch or sprint branch, to obtain a comprehensive overview of the security issues in those branches before merging them into the main branch. This practice ensures that these branches are secure before being deployed to production.

=== Support for Non-Default Branch Scans

* *Supported version control systems* (VCS): GitHub, GitLab
* *Enforcement rules*: These rules remain unimpacted, as they are enforced at the repository level, regardless of the branches scanned
* *Tagging rules*: These rules are applicable exclusively to the main branch
* *Excluding paths*: Path exclusions are implemented at the repository level, and therefore are not impacted
* *Drift detection*: Drift detection is executed on the branch being scanned and is displayed in the results for each selected branch
* *Dashboard*: Shows the results of the scanned non-default branch

=== Usage

Usage of a non-default branch is similar to that of a default branch. The following provides a reference to get you up and running.

* *Monitor code build issues*: Prisma Cloud performs periodic scans on  non-default branches of integrated repositories of Version Control Systems (VCS) and event driven scans for CI/CD pipelines. For more on monitoring scan results see xref:../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-code-build-issues.adoc [Monitor Code Build Issues].
+
NOTE: The branch name is displayed in the summary line in the Projects page

* *Fix code issues*: You can remediate scan results by adding issues to a fix cart to create a PR with a suggested fix. For more on fixing code issues see xref:../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/fix-code-issues.adoc[Fix Code Issues].
+
NOTE: When fixing an issue that has been opened on a non-default branch scan, the fix only applies to the specific branch.

* *Suppress code issues*: Eliminate false positives and more by suppressing code issues. For more on suppressing code issues see xref:../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/suppress-code-issues.adoc[Suppress Code Issues]. 

[NOTE]
====
* When suppressing an issue by policy or account, all issues are suppressed regardless of the selected branch.
* When suppressing an issue in a PR scan, the suppression will apply to the branch that the PR is about to be merged into. For example, if the periodic scan is on a non default branch, but the PR is to the default branch, then the suppression will not be applied in the periodic scans of the non-default branch.
