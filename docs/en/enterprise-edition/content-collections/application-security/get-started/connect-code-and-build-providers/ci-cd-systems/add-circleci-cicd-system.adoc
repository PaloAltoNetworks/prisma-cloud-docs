== Connect CircleCI CI/CD Systems  

Integrate CircleCI CI/CD systems (CircleCI) with Prisma Cloud to gain visibility into and monitor CircleCI and all systems, technologies and processes in your environment connected to CircleCI. This integration allows Prisma Cloud to scan your CircleCI environment and provide the results of the scan, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected.

//=== Integration Demo

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 
.. *Permissions*: To grant Prisma Cloud visibility for all CircleCI projects, a version control system (VCS) user must be authorized to grant access. This is because the CircleCI user base is integrated with the (VCS), and inherits permissions granted to VCS users.
.. Create a dedicated VCS user to integrate CircleCI with Prisma Cloud, to prevent the integration breaking if the user leaves the organization.
.. Verify that the dedicated user follows all the organization's projects in CircleCI
.. Create a personal API token (see *step 2* below). The main reason that Prisma Cloud requires personal API tokens is to allow reading the configurations from CircleCI for all the projects that a user tracks

. Generate a personal API token in CircleCI.

.. Login to your CircleCI instance with VCS user credentials.
+
NOTE: CircleCI utilizes the VCS user visibility. For example, if a GitHub user has access to specific organizations and repositories, these entities are visible and available in CircleCI.

.. https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token[Create and save a personal API token in CircleCI].

. On Prisma Cloud.
.. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

.. Fill in the following details in the provided fields of the wizard.
+
* *Integration Name*: an alias allowing you to identify the integration
* *Personal API Token*: the personal API token generated in _step 2_ above

.. Select *Create*.
+
The Prisma Cloud Application Security module is integrated with your CircleCI system.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *CI/CD Systems* tab.
.. Confirm that the status of the *CircleCI* instance displays *Active* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated and show as *Succeeded*.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
The next scan of your CircleCI systems will include the new integration, and the results will be displayed in xref:../../../visibility/repositories.adoc[Repositories].

. Select *Add integration* in the wizard.


. Repeat the integration process above.
+
The new integration is displayed on the landing page of the integration wizard. To view scan results, see the integration process above.

=== Manage Integrations

Manage integrations from the integration wizard.

. Access the CircleCi integration wizard - see *step 1* of <<multi-integrate,Support for Multiple Integrations>> above > select the menu under *Actions*.
+
From _Actions_ you can:
