== Connect Jenkins Server

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Jenkins server to gain visibility into and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the Jenkins platform.
Integrating Jenkins will allow you to conduct security scans to identify issues such as CI/CD pipeline risks, vulnerabilities, and exposed secrets in the Jenkins environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a key ID and secret
+
It is recommended to assign the access token the role of *System Admin* to facilitate integration.
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 

. On the Prisma Cloud console.
.. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

.. Select *Add Integration* from the Jenkins integration wizard.
+

.. Provide a *Jenkins Instance Display Name* > *Next*.
+
A unique *Jenkins instance identifier* is automatically generated after providing the Jenkins instance display name. This display name is an alias of your choice, allowing you to identify the integration.
+

.. Select *Download* in *step 1* of the wizard to download the Prisma Cloud Application Security Jenkins plugin *prisma-cloud.hpi* file.

.. Copy and save the unique Jenkins instance identifier from *step 2* of the wizard.

.. Select *Done*
+
The integration is added in the UI but integration is pending only and will only be completed after completing step 3 below.
+
NOTE: You can retrieve your Jenkins instance identifier by accessing the integrated Jenkins Server (see step 1 above) > selecting the *Actions* menu next to an integration in the wizard > *Copy instance identifier*.

. In Jenkins.

.. If your Jenkins server has limited outgoing connections, make sure to permit an outgoing connection from the Jenkins server to Prisma IP addresses - see _step 1_ above. 

.. Install the plugin on your Jenkins server.
+
* Open Jenkins and select: *Manage Jenkins* > *Plugins* (under _System Configuration_) > *Advanced settings*.

* Select *Choose File* in the *Deploy Plugin* section > browse for the *PrismaCloudPlugin.hpi* file > *Upload* > *Deploy*.

.. Configure the plugin.
+
* Open *Jenkins* > Select *Manage Jenkins* > *System* (under _System Configuration_) > *Prisma Cloud*.

+
* Fill in the provided fields.
+
** *Jenkins Instance Display Name*: The alias that you provided in _step 2_ above.
** *Jenkins Instance Identifier*: The identifier generated when creating the Jenkins instance display name.
** *Access Key ID*: Generated in _step 1_ above
** *Access Key Secret*: Generated in _step 1_ above
** *Reports Recurrence Period* (Value: minutes): The frequency with which reports are generated. We recommend that you do not change the default value
+
The Prisma Cloud Application Security module is integrated with your Jenkins system.
+
Always refer to the official https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/[Jenkins documentation] when installing plugins on Jenkins servers.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *CI/CD Systems* tab.
.. Confirm that the status of the *Jenkins* instance displays *Active* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated and show as *Succeeded*.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
The next scan of your Jenkins servers will include the new integration, and the results will be displayed in xref:../../../visibility/repositories.adoc[Repositories].
