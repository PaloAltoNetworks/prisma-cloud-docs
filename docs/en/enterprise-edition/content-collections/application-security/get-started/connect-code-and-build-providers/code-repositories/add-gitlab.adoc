== Connect GitLab  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitLab version control system to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitLab platform.

This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitLab environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The GitLab integration creates a webhook that triggers periodic scans of your code. These scans run on all pull requests (PRs), and their results are displayed in both the PR comments and reports.


[.procedure]

. Before you begin:

.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 
.. Grant *Administrator* permissions in the relevant GitLab organization to the Prisma user integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

+
image::application-security/gitlab-select-repos.png[]

. Select which repositories will be scanned:
+
* *Permit all existing repositories*
* *Permit all existing and future repositories*
+
NOTE: This is the recommended option to ensure complete coverage and successful operation of all features.
* *Choose from repository list*  > select repositories

.. Select *Next* > *Done* in the *Status* step of the wizard to complete the integration.

. Verify successful integration: In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers*.
+
Confirm that the status of the integrated *GitLab* repositories displays *Connected* under *Status*.
+
NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes for the integration status to be updated and show as *Succeeded*.

. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
* View your selected GitLab repositories on the *Repositories* page. The next GitLab scan will include these repositories
* To view scan results and resolve issues, select *Application Security* > *Projects*. See xref:../../../risk-management/monitor-and-manage-code-build/monitor-code-build-issues.adoc[here] for more information

=== Support for multiple integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or a same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
//* Update existing integrations by modifying the selection of workspaces
* Add additional integrations
* Delete an existing integration

+
NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *GitLab* (under Code Repositories).
. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
. Execute the GitLab installation process above.
+
. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results.
+
Your selected GitLab repositories will be visible on the *Repositories* page. The next GitLab scan will include the selected repositories.
