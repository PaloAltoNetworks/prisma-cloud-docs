== Connect GitLab Self-Managed  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitLab version control system to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitLab self-managed platform.
This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitLab environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

[.procedure]

+
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 
.. Grant *Administrator* permissions in the relevant GitLab organization to the Prisma user integrating Prisma Cloud with GitLab Self-managed

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.

.. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

[#multi-integrate]
=== Support for multiple integrations

Prisma Cloud supports multiple integrations for GitLab Self-Managed. After the initial integration with Prisma Cloud, you can continue to add additional organizations and workspaces using a different or the same user or team token.

Multiple integrations from a single Prisma Cloud account enables you to:

* View a list of integrations on a single console
* Add additional integrations.
* Delete an existing integration
+
NOTE: Selecting a repository for a specific integration will restrict you from selecting the same repository in another integration.

[.procedure]

. Add additional integrations to a configured GitLab Self-Managed account.
. In Application Security, select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers* > *GitLab Self-managed* (under Code Repositories).
.. Select *Add Integration* in the wizard.
.. Execute the installation steps above.
. Next step: Monitor and manage scan results - see _step 6_ of the integration procedure above.

//The *Configure Domain* step of the installation wizard is displayed.
