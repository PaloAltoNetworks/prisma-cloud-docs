== Code Repositories

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your code repository version control systems to scan for misconfigurations in your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files, vulnerabilities in your software composition analysis (SCA) packages, secrets exposed in your code and license non-compliance. Prisma Cloud also scan for CI/CD pipeline risks when the systems supports this feature. For more information, refer to the relevant integration guide.

Code repository integrations include:

=== Verify Integration

After integrating your version control system, you can verify if your repositories are successfully connected to Prisma Cloud by checking their status under *Settings* > *Code & Build Providers*. If they are not connected, an error message will be displayed.
