== Connect GitHub Server 

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your GitHub Server version control system to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the GitHub Server platform.
This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your GitHub Server environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.
