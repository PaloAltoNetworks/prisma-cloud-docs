== Connect Bitbucket

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your Bitbucket version control system to gain visibility into, and monitor the systems, technologies, configurations, and pipelines that make up the Bitbucket platform.
This integration enables security scans to identify Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) misconfigurations, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, license mis-compliance and CI/CD pipeline risks in your Bitbucket environment, allowing you to understand and fix issues as soon as they are detected, resulting in an enhanced security posture for your organization.

The Bitbucket integration will create a webhook that will trigger periodic scans of your code. The scans will be run on all pull requests (PRs), and the results will be displayed in the PR comments and in reports.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.

.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started.console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Grant the Prisma user the _Administrator_ role in the relevant Bitbucket organization and _Write_ access to the relevant repositories. This will allow Prisma Cloud to copy files for scanning and access repository settings to subscribe to pull request (PR) webhooks to open fix PRs and comment on opened PRs.
+
NOTE: For Write access go to *Bitbucket* > *Repository Settings* and grant the user Write access to the relevant repositories.
.. Log in to Bitbucket with the correct user credentials before integrating with Prisma Cloud, as Prisma Cloud uses OAuth for authorizing access.

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. Select *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

* *User Name*: To retrieve your Bitbucket user name, in Bitbucket, click the Bitbucket settings cog > *Settings* > locate your username under *Personal information*.
* *App Password*: To enable CI/CD Security you need to provide an additional Bitbucket App Password with repository read and repository admin permissions: 
** In Bitbucket: Go to your *Personal Settings* page > *App Passwords*. 
** Give your App Password a *Label*.
** Select the *Repository Read And Repository Admin* permissions. 
** Click *Create* > Copy the generated App password from the *New app password* dialog. The App password is only displayed once and cannot be retrieved later.
