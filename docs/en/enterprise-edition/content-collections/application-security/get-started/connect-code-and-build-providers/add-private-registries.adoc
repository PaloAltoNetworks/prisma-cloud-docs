== Connect Package Registries 

Integrate private registries to gain visibility into packages of your private registry, to provide precise dependency trees, and to scan for and fix vulnerabilities affecting images or harmful elements that have entered the registry through the software supply chain. 

Currently, Prisma Cloud Application Security supports one Artifactory integration, one registry per package manager and is limited to Maven, Gradle, NPM, Yarn, and Pip.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 
.. Grant *Administrator* permissions from Artifactory to the Prisma user integrating Prisma Cloud with your registry. However, a read-only permission of an Artifactory will not impact the scan results on the console.

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

.. Enter your *Public Artifactory URL*, *Username* and *Password* in the provided fields.
+
* The URL must include the suffix `/artifactory`. For example, `https://artifactory.org-name.io/artifactory`
* The permissions associated with the username determine the scope of the scan results for private registries

.. Select *Next*.
+
The *Setup Package Managers* step of the wizard is displayed.

.. Select a package manager to configure a registry as private instead of the default public registry.
+
NOTE: Package managers not listed will default to the public registry.

.. Select a *Registry* that the package managers use.
+
NOTE: NPM requires you to define your repository as *Private*. 

.. For Maven, you can select *Mirror Registry* if the repository is a mirror of an existing repository.

.. Optionally, select *Add Package* to set up an additional package manager.

.. Select *Next* and then select *Done*.

. Verify integration.
.. In *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Private Registries* tab.
.. View integrations and their connection under the *Status* column.
.. Additionally, you can view the dependency tree of the private packages dependency trees in the *Supply Chain*.

=== Remediation

You can remediate vulnerabilities detected on private registries through *Application Security > *Home* > *Projects* > *Vulnerabilities*.

=== Manage Integrations

For each integration you can perform additional actions through *Actions*.

* *Edit integration* 
* *Delete integration*: If an integration has multiple registries, you can choose to delete it.
* *Delete entire integration* 

Optionally, you can choose to delete a private registry integration through the console. Access *Home* > *Settings* > *Repositories* > *Add Repository* > *Private Registries* > *Artifactory* and then select *Delete* in the *Select a Registry* step of the wizard.

NOTE: After integrating a private registry, the registry becomes the default reference for package versions on the console. If a private fix version for the registry is not available, the console will recommend a public fix version.
