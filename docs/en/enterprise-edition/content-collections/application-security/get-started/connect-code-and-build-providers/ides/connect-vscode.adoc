== Add Prisma Cloud Application Security Plugin to VS Code

Integrating VS Code (Visual Studio Code) with Prisma Cloud Application security makes it possible for you to identify misconfigurations before you commit your code, and avoid pull requests that can potentially fail builds due to undetected misconfigurations. Using Prisma Cloud Code Security, a code analysis tool that scans Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files from frameworks such as Terraform_plan, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), Secrets, Serverless, Dockerfile (only code), and Kubernetes on VS Code gives you immediate detection of misconfigurations and inline code fixes.
Apart from the scanning the default Prisma Cloud policies, Prisma Cloud also scans for policy violations in custom policies that you can configure during custom build checks. 
// Waiting for path to Policies See xref:../../code-repositories-policy-management/code-repositories-policy-management.adoc[custom build-time checks.]


[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. *Access Key*: Enables access to Prisma Cloud. If you do not have the access key, refer to xref:../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key]
.. *Roles and Permissions* Grant Developer (minimum) role with access to specific repositories. The Developer role provides view and access to  *Fix and Submit* changes to the relevant VCS repositories. If a user has more than one Prisma Cloud Role assigned to them, the access key associated with the default role is used when accessing Prisma Cloud
.. *Secret Key*: The secret key generates with your access key. Save your secret key when you generate it, as you cannot view it again on Prima Cloud
.. *Install Python*: Prisma Cloud Code Security requires Python to run. Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python version 3.8] or above. If you have a versatile working environment of both pip and virtual environment install https://docs.pipenv.org/[Pipenv] or https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker]
.. *Prisma Cloud API URL*: When you configure the Prisma Cloud Code Security plugin to VScode (Visual Studio Code) you need Prisma Cloud API URL. The URL for Prisma Cloud varies depending on the region and cluster on which your tenant is deployed. The tenant provisioned for you is, for example, https://app2.prismacloud.io or https://app.eu.prismacloud.io. For Prisma Cloud API URL, replace *app* in the URL with *api*
* Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 

. On Prisma Cloud Application security.
.. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.

.. Select *VS Code* (under IDEs) in the catalog that is displayed.
+
image::application-security/connect-provider.png[]
+
You are directed to Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

. Install and enable Prisma Cloud Code Security on VS Code.

.. Select *Install > Continue > Open Visual Studio Code* and then select *Install*.
+
You can also access VS Code directly from your system and access the Prisma Cloud plugin from *Extensions* and then search for the Prisma Cloud plugin.


. Configure the Prisma Cloud plugin on VS Code.

.. Select *Extension > Extension Settings*.
.. Add your Prisma Cloud application API for *Prisma Cloud:Prisma URL* for example *https://api.prismacloud.io*.

.. Add your Prisma Cloud access key and secret key as *"Access Key::Secret Key"* for *Checkov:Token*.
+
You can optionally choose to add a custom CA-Certificate and enter the certificate path to configure for *Prisma Cloud:Certificate*. Ensure your CA-Certificate is in `.pem` format.
+
A Prisma Cloud Code Security scan runs each time you access a file on VS Code.

. Fix scanned files for policy misconfiguration in build-time checks.

.. Select a file. Prisma Cloud runs an immediate scan on the file.

.. View the highlighted policy misconfiguration inline.
+

.. Select *Quick Fix* to fix the misconfiguration inline.
+
You can optionally select *View Problem* to know more about the misconfiguration.
+

+
Each misconfiguration has details on the policy violation and guidelines to fix the policy. See xref:../../../../governance.adoc[here] for more about each of misconfigurations in all supported environments.

=== Troubleshoot Logs

In case of a Prisma Cloud scan fail, you can access VS Code logs to know see more details.

. Access VS Code *Command Palette* or enter *Ctrl + Shift + P* for Windows or *Cmd + Shift + P* for Mac > run: `Developer: Open Extensions Logs Folder` > search for *Prisma Cloud*.
