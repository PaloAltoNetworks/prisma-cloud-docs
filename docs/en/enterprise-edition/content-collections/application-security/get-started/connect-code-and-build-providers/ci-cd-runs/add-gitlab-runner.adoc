== Connect GitLab Runner

Integrate Prisma Cloud Code Security with GitLab Runner to seamlessly embed vulnerability detection into your GitLab CI/CD pipelines. This integration enables continuous scanning of your workflow whenever changes are pushed or triggered,integrating security checks, and catching issues as soon as they are introduced. Additionally, it automates shift-left actions such as notifying developers or creating tickets, based on scan results.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin.
.. xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a Key ID and Secret.
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console. 
. Create or open the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repository for editing, or alternatively, navigate to *CI/CD* > *Editor* in your GitLab project.
. Add your Prisma *Access Key* and Prisma *Secret Key* as GitLab environment variables named `PRISMA_ACCESS_KEY` and `PRISMA_SECRET_KEY` respectively.
+
NOTE: For additional information about GitLab variables, refer to the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#create-a-custom-variable-in-the-ui[GitLab documentation on creating custom variables].
. Add the following job code to the appropriate stage in the file.

NOTE: Update the `PRISMA_API_URL` with the `API URL` corresponding to your Prisma Cloud stack. Refer to the  xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[available list of URLs] for more information. 

=== Verify Integration

To verify the integration with Prisma Cloud, in *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *CICD Runs* tab. Your integrated repositories will be displayed. You may have to wait for up to three minutes before the status of the integration is updated.

NOTE: Although the Prisma Cloud UI does not natively support a GitLab Runner integration, your repository will still be visible in the UI as a CLI Repository.

=== USAGE

After completing the integration, Prisma Cloud will automatically conduct a scan, and the outcomes will be presented in the *Tests* section on GitLab and on the *Projects* page of the Prisma Cloud console. 

NOTE: GitLab Runner does not support CI/CD Security scans.
