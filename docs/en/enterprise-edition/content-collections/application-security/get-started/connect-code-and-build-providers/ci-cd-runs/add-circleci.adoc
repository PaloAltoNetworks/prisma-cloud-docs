== Connect CircleCI  

Integrate Prisma Cloud with your CircleCI system to allow dynamic, automated, and context-specific scans within your development workflow. This includes continuous scanning of your workflow whenever changes are pushed or triggered, integrating security checks, and catching issues as soon as they are introduced. Additionally, it automates shift-left actions such as notifying developers or creating tickets, based on scan results.

[.procedure]
. Before you begin:
.. xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[Generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a key ID and secret
.. Add the Prisma Cloud IP addresses and hostname for Application Security to an xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[allow list] to enable access to the Prisma Cloud Console 
.. Grant the Prisma user integrating Prisma Cloud with CircleCI *Administrator* user permissions. 

. On the Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. In Application Security, select *Home* > *Settings* > *Connect Provider* > *Code & Build Providers*.
