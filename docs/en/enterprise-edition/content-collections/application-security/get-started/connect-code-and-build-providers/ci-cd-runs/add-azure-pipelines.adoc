== Connect Azure Pipelines

Integrate Prisma Cloud Code Security with Azure Pipelines to seamlessly embed vulnerability detection into your Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines. This integration enables continuous scanning and detection of your your infrastructure as code (IaC) and code repositories as a part of your CI/CD workflows. Additionally, it automates shift-left actions and provides reporting and tracking on the Prisma Cloud administrative console.

[.procedure]

. Before you begin, xref:../../../../administration/create-access-keys.adoc[generate and copy the Prisma Cloud access key] to enable access to Prisma Cloud. The access key includes a Key ID and Secret.
. Create or open the `.azure-pipelines.yml` file in your repository for editing, or alternatively, navigate to *CI/CD* > *Editor* in your Azure project.
. In *Azure DevOps*, create a new pipeline or select an existing pipeline and select *Edit*. 
+
An editor for the `azure-pipelines.yml` configuration file is displayed.

- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.8'
  displayName: 'Install Python 3.8'
- script: pip install checkov
  displayName: 'Install Checkov'
- script: checkov -d <directory> --bc-api-key <prisma_access_key>::<prisma_secret_key> --repo-id <org/repo> --branch <branch>
  displayName: 'Scan with Prisma Cloud'
  env:
    PRISMA_API_URL: <prisma_stack_api>
----

The code snippet above includes the following arguments:

* <directory>: The directory of the repository you wish to scan.

* <prisma_access_key>::<prisma_secret_key>: A combination of your Prisma Access Key and Prisma Secret Key. As a best practice, store this access the access key and secret in a vault

* <org/repo>: Your VCS organization name and repository name

* <branch>: The branch to be scanned

* <prisma_stack_api>: The *API URL* for your Prisma Cloud stack. Refer to the xref:../../../../get-started/console-prerequisites.adoc[available list of URLs] for more information. 

NOTE: Use `--soft-fail` to scan the build for errors without failing the job or stage.

For additional scan settings, refer to the https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/CLI%20Command%20Reference.html[CLI Command Reference guide].

=== Verify Integration

To verify the integration with Prisma Cloud, in *Application Security*, select *Home* > *Settings* > *CICD Runs* tab. Your integrated repositories will be displayed. You may have to wait for up to three minutes before the status of the integration is updated.

NOTE: Although the Prisma Cloud UI does not natively support an Azure Pipelines integration, your repository will still be visible in the UI as a CLI Repository.

=== USAGE

After completing the integration, Prisma Cloud will automatically conduct a scan, and the outcomes will be presented in the pipeline logs and on the *Projects* page of the Prisma Cloud console.
