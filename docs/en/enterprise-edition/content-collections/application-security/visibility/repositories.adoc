== Repositories

*Repositories* provides a comprehensive view of your engineering technical stack from repository to deployment, all within a repository-based view. This allows you to identify and analyze all your code repositories, their associated infrastructure such as programming languages, frameworks, CI files and so on, and your paths to production.

'Repositories' maps your organization's security posture, allowing you to understand the high and critical risks in your repositories. The <<appgraph-,Application Graph>> provides additional insights into your repository assets. It's query capabilities allow you to explore the graph and to find specific information. This helps you to prioritize and address the most critical security issues first, reducing the risk of security breaches.

NOTE: The repositories displayed in the inventory are limited to those selected during VCS onboarding. To ensure complete visibility, it is recommended to select all repositories during VCS onboarding. Users will only see repositories to which they have been granted access, based on their designated roles and permissions.

//See xref:getting-started.adoc#manage-role-permission[Manage Roles and Permissions]for more.

To access *Repositories*, in *Application Security* select *Home*.

*Repositories* opens by default, displaying an inventory of your engineering technical stack, organized by repository.

The inventory includes the following details.

* *Version control system* (VCS) platform: Represents the VCS hosting the repository.

* *Repository Name*: A list of all repositories detected from all the VCS integrations. Includes a link to the repository

* *Visibility*: Whether the repository is private or public (displayed as an icon)

* *Archived*: Whether the repository is archived (displayed as an icon)

* *Contributors*: A list of contributors to the repository. Clicking on a number displayed in the column opens a pop-up with more details about the contributors. Additional information about the contributors can also be found by selecting a repository which opens the resource explorer, as described below

* *Technologies*: Displays the most frequently used languages and frameworks detected in the repository. Hover over a technology to its frequency of usage in the pipeline. Selecting the number displayed in the column displays a popup, with information about additional technologies detected in the repository.

* *Pipelines*: The CI/CD pipeline systems such as Jenkins and GitHub Actions that are connected to the repository. Clicking on the number next to a pipeline opens a pop-up displaying details about the pipelines. Note that you must integrate your CI systems in order to view connected pipelines

* *Issues*: The number of IaC, Secrets, SCA and CI/CD issues detected in the master branch of a repository. Clicking on the link redirects to the relevant issue page. IaC, Secrets and SCA issues redirect to the Projects page, while CI/CD issues redirect to CI/CD Risks, where the issues are displayed filtered by repository and high-critical severity

* *Last Update*: THe last date that the repository was updated, that is new code pushed

* *Actions*: Selecting the menu under the Actions column displays the *Application Graph*, a graphical representation of the repository's path to production. See <<appgraph-,Application Graph>> below for more
//image::application-security/icon-app-graph.png[]
// ** <<last-pull-request-scan,Last Pull Request Scan>>: A link to details of the last repository PR scan
// ** <<sbom-,SBOM>>: A link to the repository SBOM.

Selecting a repository in the inventory table opens the *resource explorer*, displaying additional information.

The *Details* tab opens opens as the default view, displaying metadata about the repository, including repo size, last commit, dependencies (with a link to the SBOM page, filtered by the repository) and CI files. In addition, technologies detected in the repository, including programming languages and frameworks, are displayed.

=== Application Graph

You can view the repository as a graphical representation, allowing you to explore, better understand and analyze the repository assets and connections. This will allow you to get a better understanding of your technology stack, attack vectors and security posture. The development
path from version control system to deployment including the different technologies, systems and configurations in the engineering environment are presented as nodes on a graph, while edges provide details of the relationship between the nodes.

The Application Graph currently supports the following systems:

* VCS platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
* Continuous integration (CI) systems: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions

To view a repository as a graph:
* Select a repository in the inventory table > *Graph* tab OR:
* Select the Graph View icon located in the _Actions_ column of a repository in the inventory table

The *Application Graph* representing the repository is displayed.

image::application-security/repositories-app-graph1.1.png[]

The Application Graph includes the following components:

* <<nodes-,Nodes>>: The assets of a repository. Can include entities
* <<edges-,Edges>>: The connections between nodes

//* <<graphfilters-,Graph Filters>>: Includes out-of-the-box *Categories* and *Predefined Queries*
//* <<query-builder-,Query Builder>>: Create custom queries

* *Export*: Download graph data as a png image or JSON file
* *Controls*: Include zoom and reset
