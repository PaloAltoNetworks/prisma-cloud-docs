== VCS 3rd Parties

*VCS 3rd Parties* displays an inventory of third party applications (apps) and webhooks found in your organization's version control system (VCS). This allows you to understand where they are in use in the organization, and to remove unused apps or webhooks in order to reduce your attack surface. In addition, you can view and understand permissions that applications have and remove excessive permissions where not required. This will help you abide by the 'least permission' principle, which states that applications should only be granted the permissions that they need to do their job.

To access *VCS 3rd Parties*, in *Application Security* select > *Home* > *Technologies* > click on the *VCS 3rd Parties* tab.
