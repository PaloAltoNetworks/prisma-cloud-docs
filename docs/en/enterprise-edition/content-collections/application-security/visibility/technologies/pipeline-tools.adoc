== Pipeline Tools

*Pipeline Tools* provides an inventory of all third party services and tools used by an organization's CI/CD pipeline. This visibility is invaluable, as it reveals the tools running in your CI/CD systems that are highly sensitive. We recommend reviewing the tools detected and displayed in the inventory with your engineering teams to ensure that the tools are all recognized and approved. Special attention should be given to tools with names designated as *Not Available*, as this could  indicate less popular tools, or in some cases, even malicious ones.

You can gain insights into the scripts running in the CI pipeline and their usage, allowing you to understand risks and take action to reduce your attack surface. 

NOTE: Pipeline Tools currently supports Jenkins declarative pipelines, CircleCI, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines.
