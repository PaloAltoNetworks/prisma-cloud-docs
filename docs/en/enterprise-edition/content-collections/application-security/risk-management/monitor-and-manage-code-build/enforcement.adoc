== Enforcement

Enforcement enables you to configure code review scan parameters in your repositories and customize violation failures and comments. On the Prisma Cloud console there are default parameters, based on best practices, for each code category scanned  in your repositories. Using enforcement  you can configure these default parameters and receive violation notifications only for critical issues, helping you reduce unnecessary noise and optimizing secure productivity.

Enforcement configurations scan every commit into your repository and suggest fix remedies, if any violation is detected, this is in addition to the scan that Prisma Cloud periodically performs on your repositories, the results for which are accessible on Projects.
The periodic scans have a predefined severity threshold which are run across code categories that result in three run rules.

* *Hard Fail*
+
A repository scan result fails when Prisma Cloud detects a violation or a vulnerability.

* *Soft Fail*
+
A repository scan result is a pass and a notification appears on the console when Prisma Cloud detects a violation or a vulnerability.

* *Comment bot*
+
A repository scan result  displays issues with fix suggestions as comments with Pull requests accessible on VCS (Version Control System).

Prisma Cloud scans multiple code categories to identify vulnerabilities and violations unique to the category. See the table for more details.


[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Code Category | Description

|*Vulnerabilities*
|Vulnerabilities found in open source packages.

|*Licenses*
|License compliance issues found in open source packages and container images.

|*Infrastructure as Code (IaC)*
|Misconfiguration issues found in IaC files (relevant for users who provision and manage their infrastructure via code).

|*Secrets*
|Secret leaks across code files that might hinder access to information, services or assets.

You can manage Enforcement configuration scan results by modifying the default configurations, adding an exception configuration, turning run rule off for a code category configurations, and reviewing either fail scans or suggestions to a vulnerability on your VCS (Version Control System).

NOTE: See xref:../../../administration/prisma-cloud-admin-permissions.adoc[Prisma Cloud Administrator Permissions] and know more about user roles and permissions to configure enforcement.

* <<modify-default-enforcement, Modify the default parameters.>>
+
You can modify the default parameters for each code category and set up a new default parameter. However, each time a default configuration is modified, the parameters are applicable across all repositories on the Prisma Cloud console.
+
NOTE: Soft Fail configuration for any code category must be lower than Hard Fail.

* <<add-an-exception-to-enforcement, Add an exception.>>
+
You can  add an exception configuration for each code category that is applicable only for select repositories that you have access to. The exception configuration runs in addition to the default enforcement configurations.

* <<turn-off-run-rule-scan-for-a-code-category, Turn off run rule scan for a code category.>>
+
You can choose to prevent an enforcement configuration from running a scan for one or more run rules for a code category. The parameter to turn off a scan for a code category can be an addition to either a default configuration or to an exception configuration. Turning the scan off for a run rule in a code category results in no code review scan.

* <<review-fail-scans-and-suggestions-on-vcs, Review fail scans and suggestions on VCS (Version Control System).>>
+
For every failed scan result you can view the latest Pull Request (PR) of your repository within the Prisma Cloud console. Currently the ability to review violation fix suggestions and view the Pull Request (PR) scans that failed is supported only for Github repositories. From the Prisma Cloud console you can directly access your repositories in Github and remediate solutions through a Pull Request (PR).


[.task]

[#access-enforcement]
=== Access Enforcement

[.procedure]

. Access Enforcement on Prisma Cloud Application Security console.
.. Select *Application Security* on Prisma Cloud switcher and then select *Projects >Action* menu.
.. Select *Enforcement* from the list.
+

[.task]

[#modify-default-enforcement]
=== Modify Default Enforcement

While you have the option to customize the default enforcement configuration, it's important to note that any modifications made will apply universally to all repositories on the console.

NOTE: The default enforcement configurations cannot be deleted

[.procedure]

. <<access-enforcement,Access>> default enforcement configuration.

. Modify the default configuration.

.. Select a code category.
+
In this example, see Vulnerabilities.
+
image::application-security/enfor-3.png[]

.. Select the severity threshold corresponding to the code category.
+
In this example, severity is *High* for Vulnerabilities.
+
image::application-security/enfor-4.png[]
+
You can choose to continue modifying other code categories or conclude with a single modification.
+
You can also choose to <<turn-off-run-rule-scan-for-a-code-category,turn off>> the severity threshold of a code category.

.. Select *Save* the modified enforcement configuration.


[.task]

[#add-an-exception-to-enforcement]
=== Add an Exception to Enforcement

To ensure your focus is only on critical issues and you receive violation notifications on important repositories, you can add an exception to the Enforcement.

[.procedure]

. <<access-enforcement,Access>> enforcement.

. Add an exception to enforcement.
.. Select *Add exception*.
+
image::application-security/enfor-6.png[]

. Configure exception parameters.
