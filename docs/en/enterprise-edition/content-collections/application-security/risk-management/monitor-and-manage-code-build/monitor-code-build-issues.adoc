== Monitor Code Build Issues

Prisma Cloud performs periodic scans on each integrated repository of the Version Control Systems (VCS) and event driven scans for CI/CD pipelines to find infrastructure misconfigurations, open source vulnerabilities, license compliance violations, and exposed secrets. After successful integrations there are three types of scans run on the console.

* *VCS default branch scans*: Periodic scans performed on all main branches across repositories. During integration if you have not specified the branches for scan in your repository, Prisma Cloud by default considers the master branch.
* *VCS Pull Requests*: Event driven scans using Enforcement parameters are run on branches with open Pull Requests (PR) from your integrated repositories. The scan results are determined by the default *Enforcement* thresholds or otherwise configured by you.
* *CLI and CI/CD runs*: Event driven scans performed on runs as configured by using the Enforcement parameters.

//TODO: On *Projects* you see a consolidated view of the scan results where categorization of issues is by the code category views.
There are five code category views - *IaC misconfiguration, Vulnerabilities, Secrets,* and *Licenses*. In addition you can see a contextual summary of issues across code categories on *Overview*.

| Projects Code Category View
| Description

|Overview
|A summary view of all your scan results across all code categories. The Overview lists errors by prioritizing build issues across the integrations.

|IaC Misconfiguration
|The view lists security issues after scanning integrated repositories, wherein the default branch of a repository lists all application security violations in the resource block with code tags, resource dependencies and resource history.

|Vulnerabilities
|The error list in Vulnerabilities are open source dependency errors found in scanned open source packages and container image dependencies.
//For more information to resolve vulnerability issues see xref:fix-issues-in-a-scan-result.adoc[here].

|Secrets
|A Secret is a programmatic access key that provides systems access to information, services, or assets. Secrets like API keys, encryption keys, OAuth tokens, certificates, PEM files, passwords, and passphrases are often explicitly stored in local or feature branches before being pushed to a main branch. In this view, see issues identified in your source code with remediation to perform a Manual Fix or Suppress the issue within the file where the issue originates. Scans also run on Git history to identify secrets that are removed from code but are present in Git history.

|Licenses
|Most open source software includes a license governing its use. License scanning identifies packages that violate open source usage policies. In this view, see the listing of licensing issues through periodic scans.

|VCS Pull Requests
| After configuring Enforcement, view issues for scans run on all open Pull Requests (PR) for your integrated repositories. On the Prisma Cloud console, you can access the scan result from the console or choose to access the VCS console and view the specific commit within PR for a manual fix.

|CI/CD Runs
|View issues for scans performing on runs of your integrated CI/CD pipelines.

|===

To find relevant non-conformant scan results you can use filters or search using keywords or tags (if they are already a part of the code).

For each misconfiguration on *Projects*, you can either *Suppress* the issue, *Fix* it from the Prisma Cloud console, or access the repository in the Version Control System (VCS) to perform a manual fix.


=== Issue Blocks

The scan results across code categories are seen as Issue Blocks. To help you  prioritize the issues you can custom group the issues as a *Resource* or *Policy*.

* *Resource Issue Blocks*
+
After periodic scans on resources, Prisma Cloud generates contextualized scanned results of each resource as a resource block. Scan results are vulnerabilities in the code or code errors found within the resource. Each resource block displays only five issues by default. Show More helps you display more issues within the resource.

* *Policy Issue Blocks*
+
After periodic scans, Prisma Cloud generates a policy issue block. Within it are contextualized scan results with names and lists of all the resources violating the policy. As a default for event based scans on Licenses and VCS Pull Requests you will see issues as a policy issue block.
+
NOTE: In *Vulnerabilities* view, the grouping of policy issue blocks is according to the CVE severity.

==== Types of Issue Blocks

Each code category can generate either a resource or a policy issue block. For understanding the types of blocks corresponding to the code category see the table.
