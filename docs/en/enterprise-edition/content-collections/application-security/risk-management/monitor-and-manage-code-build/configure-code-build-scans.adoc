== Configure Code Build Scans

From *Projects > More Actions* you have the options to enhance the scan results you see. The options enable you to export the issues to external sources to make profound business decisions or you can choose to add another layer of configurations for your next scan.

* *Export as CSV*
+
You can export issues across code categories with configured filters as a CSV report. The CSV report includes the following information:
+
** *Code Category*: View the code category of the issue.
** *Status*: View if the issue is Open, Suppressed, Fixed, Passed or Fix Pending.
** *Severity*: View the severity of the issue.
** *IaC Category or Risk Factor*: View if the issue is in the code category of IaC misconfigurations or Risk Factor for Secrets and Vulnerabilities.
** *Policy ID*: View the Prisma Cloud policy ID that is non-conformant.
Policy Reference: Helps you navigate to the policy reference guide to know more about the non-conformant policy.
** *Title*: The policy name or CVE ID based on the issue.

** *First Detection Date*: Indicates when the issue was first detected.
** *Resource Name*: The name of the resource where the issue is found.
** *Scan item*: Only for issues in Code Reviews, you can view  information on Pull Request ID, Pull Request Name, Commit hash for VCS Pull Requests or CI/CD branch and Run ID for CI/CD Runs.
** *Source ID*: This is the repository name.
** *Suggested Fix*: This shows if the scan results have recommended fixes. For IaC misconfigurations you will see if a fix *Exists*. For Vulnerabilities you will see a package version bump to.

* *Scan Now*
+
You can always initiate a manual scan across your repositories to view the latest scan results. From Prisma Cloud switcher select *Application Security* and then *Projects*, across all views you will see the latest scan results that are periodically performed. A manual scan is recommended when you have integrated a new repository and would like to see the scan results immediately. Alternatively, you can perform a manual scan when implementing a violation fix.

* *Generate Shareable Link*
+
For your peer to take a quick peek at the issues in a specific code category view with configured filters, you can share a link. Use *Generate Shareable Link* to create a custom link.

* xref:../../get-started/application-security-settings/application-security-settings.adoc[*Application Security Settings*]
+
After your code repositories are integrated, you can modify the configuration to specify how Prisma Cloud scans your code.

* xref:enforcement.adoc[*Enforcement*]
+
Enforcement enables you to configure code review scan parameters in your repositories and customize violation failures and comments. Enforcement configurations scan every commit into your repository and suggest fixes if any violation is detected. This is in addition to the scan that Prisma Cloud periodically performs on your repositories.

* xref:traceability-and-tagging.adoc[*Traceability and Tagging*]
+
You can manage tags and tag rules for all resources with assigned repositories integrated on Prisma Cloud for governance and monitoring or enforcing policies for provisioned resources. You can enable, disable, and edit tags for any cloud resource, except auto-generated trace tags (yor_trace) on the Prisma Cloud console.
