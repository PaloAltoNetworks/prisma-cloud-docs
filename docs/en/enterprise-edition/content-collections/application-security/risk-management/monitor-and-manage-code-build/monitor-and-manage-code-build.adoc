== Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues

In a software development landscape, code to cloud security requires a critical solution. This approach focuses on securing applications from the initial code development phase to deployment and operation in the cloud environment. A significant aspect of code to cloud security is ensuring code security during the build phase, which involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and security issues before code is deployed.

Before you begin, ensure you have connected xref:../../get-started/connect-code-and-build-providers/connect-code-build-providers.adoc[Code and Build Providers] and xref:../../get-started/enable-application-security.adoc[enabled Application Security subscription.]

|*Fix or Suppress Code Security Issues*

Enable quick resolution for critical vulnerabilities through manual or automated remediation. For less urgent issues requiring further investigation, suppression allows teams to address them at a more convenient time, without hindering deployment.
