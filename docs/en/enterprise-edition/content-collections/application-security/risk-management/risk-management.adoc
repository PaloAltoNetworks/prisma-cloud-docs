== Risk Management

Application Security's capabilities allow you to:

* Detect and prevent threats, misconfigurations and vulnerabilities before they are deployed in your code from reaching production environments
* Focus on the security controls and measures around the delivery chain itself, in order to optimize the security posture of each individual system within the CI/CD, as well as their interconnectivity with third parties.
