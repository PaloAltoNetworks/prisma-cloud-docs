== Host Defender architecture

Because weâ€™ve built Prisma Cloud expressly for cloud native stacks, the architecture of our agent (what we call Defender) is quite different. 
Rather than having to install a kernel module, or modify the host OS at all, Defender instead runs as a systemd or system module (not a kernel module) in user space, intercepting every syscall interaction and file changes, and actively blocking or alerting according to the rules defined in Console.
