== Continuous integration

Prisma Cloud integrates security into your continuous integration workflows so you can find and fix problems before they enter production.
Prisma Cloud's CI plugins surface vulnerability and compliance issues directly in the build tool every time developers build their container images and serverless functions.
Security teams can set policies that only allow compliant and fully remediated images to progress down the pipeline.
