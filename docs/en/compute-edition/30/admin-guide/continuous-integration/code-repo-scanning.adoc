== Code repo scanning

Both twistcli and the Jenkins plugin can evaluate package dependencies in your code repositories for vulnerabilities.

The runtimes supported are:

* Go
* Java
* Node.js
* Python
* Ruby

[.task]
=== Integrate code scanning into CI builds

Point the Jenkins plugin to your code repo in the build directory.

*Prerequisites:* You've xref:../continuous-integration/jenkins-plugin.adoc[installed and configured the Prisma Cloud Jenkins plugin].

[.procedure]
. In your Jenkins job configuration, click *Add build step*, and select *Scan Prisma Cloud Code Repositories*.

. Configure the repo scan.

.. In *Repository Name*, specify the name to be used when reporting the results in Console.

.. In *Repository path*, specify the path to the repo in the build directory.
+
For example, it could simply be the current working directory (`.`) or some relative directory.

. Click *Save*, and then execute a build job.
+
To see the scan results, log into Console, and go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Code repositories > CI*.
Prisma Cloud evaluates the contents of the repo according to the policy you've specified in *Defend Vulnerabilities > Code repositories > CI*.
Prisma Cloud ships with a single default rule that alerts on all vulnerabilities.

=== Use twistcli to scan repos in the CI

If you're using a CI tool other than Jenkins, Prisma Cloud ships a command line utility that can be invoked from the shell in the build pipeline.
