== Audit

Prisma Cloud creates and stores audit event records (audits) for all major subsystems.
Audits can be reviewed in Monitor > Events, or they can be retrieved from the Prisma Cloud API.
If you have a centralized syslog collector, you can integrate Prisma Cloud with your existing infrastructure by configuring Prisma Cloud to send all audit events to syslog in RFC5424-compliant format.
