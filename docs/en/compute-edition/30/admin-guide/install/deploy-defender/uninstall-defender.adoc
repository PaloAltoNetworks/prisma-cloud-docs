== Uninstall Defenders

The preferred method to uninstall Defenders is via the Console UI under *Manage > Defenders*.

Regularly uninstalling stale Defenders keeps your view of the environment clean and conserves licenses.
You can uninstall Defenders can be decommissioned from the Console UI or the Prisma Cloud API.

Prisma Cloud automatically removes stale Defenders for you.
Automatic removal is recommended in large scale environments.
If Defenders are not uninstalled many can become permanently offline and clutter your view of the environment.
To keep your view clean, the Prisma Cloud Console automatically uninstalls Defenders that haven't been connected to it for more than one day.
This keeps the list of connected Defenders valid for any given 24-hour window.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
The refresh period can be configured up to a maximum of 365 days under *Manage > Defenders > Settings > Automatically remove disconnected Defenders after (days)*.
endif::compute_edition[]

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
The refresh period can be configured up to a maximum of 365 days under *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders | Auto-defend > Advanced settings > Automatically remove disconnected Defenders after (days)*.
endif::prisma_cloud[]

[NOTE]
====
We recommend letting Prisma Cloud automatically uninstall stale Defenders rather than using the UI or API.

=== Decommission Defenders manually

You can manually decommission the Defenders from the Console.

* Go to *Manage > Defenders* to see a list of all the Defenders connected to Console.
* Under *Actions*, select *Delete* to decommission the respective Defender.

=== Decommission Defenders with the API

The following endpoint can be used to decommission a Defender.

*Path*

  DELETE /api/v1/defenders/[hostname]

*Description*

Deletes a Defender from the database.
This endpoint does not actually uninstall Defender.
Use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host.
You can find the FQDN of the host in *Manage > Defenders > Actions > Manage*.

*Example request*

  $ curl -X DELETE \
    -u <USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>
    'https://<CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/defenders/aqsa-cto.sandbox'

=== Force Uninstall Defender

If a Defender instance is not connected to the Prisma Cloud Console, or is otherwise not manageable through the UI, you can manually remove it.

Go to the Linux host where the Container Defender runs and use the following command:

  $ sudo /var/lib/twistlock/scripts/twistlock.sh -u

IMPORTANT: If you run this command on the same Linux host where the Prisma Cloud Console is installed, it also uninstalls Prisma Cloud Console.

On the Linux host where Host Defender runs, use the following command:

  $ sudo /var/lib/twistlock/scripts/twistlock.sh -u defender-server

On the Windows host where Defender runs, use the following command:

  C:\Program Files\Prisma Cloud\scripts\defender.ps1 -uninstall

=== Uninstall all Prisma Cloud Resources in a Kubernetes Environment

To uninstall all Prisma Cloud resources from a Kubernetes-based deployment, delete the `twistlock` namespace.
Deleting this namespace deletes every resource within the namespace.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
When you delete the `twistlock` namespace, you also delete the persistent volume (PV) in the namespace.
By default, the Prisma Cloud Console stores its data in that PV.
When the PV is deleted, all data is lost, and you can't restore the Prisma Cloud Console.

[.procedure]
. Delete the _twistlock_ namespace.

[source,bash]
