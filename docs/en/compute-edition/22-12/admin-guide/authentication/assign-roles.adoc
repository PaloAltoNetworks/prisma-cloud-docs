== Assign roles

ifdef::compute_edition[]

After creating a user or group, you can assign a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[role] to it.
Roles determine the level of access to Prisma Cloud’s data and settings.

Prisma Cloud supports two types of users and groups:

* Centrally managed users and groups, defined in your organization’s directory service.
With directory services such as Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and SAML providers, you can re-use the identities set up in these systems.
* Prisma Cloud users and groups, created and managed from Console.
For centrally managed users groups, roles can be assigned after you integrate your directory service with Prisma Cloud.
Roles can be assigned to individual users or to groups.
When you assign a role to a group, all members of the group inherit the role.
Managing role assignments at the group level is considered a best practice.
Groups provide an easier way to manage a large user base, and simpler foundation for building your access control policies.

For Prisma Cloud users and groups, roles are assigned at the user level when the user is created.
When you create a Prisma Cloud group, you add Prisma Cloud users to it.
Users in this type of group always retain the role they were assigned when they were created.


[.task]
=== Assigning roles to Prisma Cloud users

If you do not have a directory service, such as Active Directory (AD) or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Prisma Cloud lets you create and manage your own users and groups.
When you create a Prisma Cloud user, you can assign it a role, which determines its level of access.

To create a user and assign it a role:

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and log in with your admin credentials.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add user*.

.. Enter a username.

.. Enter a password.

.. Assign a role.

.. Click *Save*.


[.task]
=== Assigning roles to Prisma Cloud groups

Collecting users into groups makes it easier to manage your access control rules.

NOTE: Each user in the group retains his own role to prevent erroneous privilege escalation.

To create a Prisma Cloud group and add users to it:

[.procedure]
. Open Console and log in with your admin credentials.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

. Click *Add group*.

.. Enter a name for your group.

.. In the drop down list, select a user.

.. Click *+*.

.. Repeat steps b to c until your group contains all the members you want.

.. Click *Save:


[.task]
=== Assigning roles to AD/OpenLDAP/SAML users

By default, AD/OpenLDAP/SAML users have the very basic Access User role.
You can grant users a different level of access to Console by assigning them roles.

NOTE: If a user is a part of an AD, OpenLDAP, or SAML group, and you have assigned a role to the group, the user inherits the group's role.

*Prerequisites:* You have integrated Prisma Cloud with Active Directory, OpenLDAP, or SAML.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Log in with your admin credentials.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add user*.

.. Enter the username for the user whose role you want to set.
For example, if you have integrated Prisma Cloud with Active Directory, enter a UPN.

.. In the *Role* drop-down menu, select a role.

.. Click *Save*.


[.task]
=== Assigning roles to AD/OpenLDAP/SAML groups

You can assign an AD/OpenLDAP/SAML group a role.
Members of the group inherit the group’s role.
When a user from a group tries to access a resource protected by Prisma Cloud, Prisma Cloud resolves the member’s role on the fly.

[NOTE]
====
If a user is assigned multiple system roles, either directly or through group inheritance, then the user is granted the rights of the highest role.
If a user is assigned both system and custom roles, then the user will be randomly granted the rights of one of the roles.

For example, assume Bruce is part of GroupA and GroupB in Active Directory.
In Console, you assign the Administrator role to GroupA and the Auditor role to GroupB.
When Bruce logs into Prisma Cloud, he will have Administrator rights.
====

The following procedure shows you how to assign a role to an existing AD/OpenLDAP/SAML group:

*Prerequisites:* You have integrated Prisma Cloud with Active Directory, OpenLDAP, or SAML.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and log in with your admin credentials.

. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Groups*.

. Click *Add group*.

.. Specify the name of the group. It should match the group name specified in your directory service.

.. Check LDAP group.

.. Select a role.

.. Click *Save*.

After creating a user or group, you can assign roles to it.
Roles determine the level of access to Prisma Cloud’s data and settings.

=== Creating and Assigning roles to Compute Users in Prisma Cloud

There are a set of permissions that can be applied to a role while creating it.

image::saas_assign_roles_role.png[width=600]


==== Permission Group and Advanced Options

Each of the permission groups in platform are mapped to Compute User roles.
For more information see xref:../authentication/prisma_cloud_user_roles.adoc[Prisma Cloud User Roles mapping].


==== Account Groups

* You can assign onboarded cloud accounts in Prisma Cloud for RBAC access to Compute resources. 

* Starting in Hamilton release, you can type "Account IDs" as string in the *Non-Onboarded Account IDs* field to give RBAC access to data in Compute from accounts that are not onboarded in Prisma Cloud. 

* The following Account group consists of some onboarded cloud accounts and an additional account with ID "gcp-prod". 
+
image::saas_assign_roles_accountgroup.png[width=600]
+
NOTE: A wildcard for this textbox will be treated as "All" accounts regardless of onboarded or not, where account ID metadata is available. This doesn't apply to Windows Defenders or other environments where cloud account metadata is not available. 


[.task]
==== Resource Lists

Starting in Hamilton release, you can assign Resource lists with type *Compute Access Groups* in conjunction with Account Groups to Compute users.

These lists provide a light-weight mechanism to provision least-privilege access to the resources in your environment.

You can assign these to specific users and groups to limit their view of data and resources in the Compute Console.

NOTE: Some entities like CI functions aren’t updated with new Compute Access group lists. Only the lists matched during the time of the scan.

NOTE: These lists define an "and" relationship between resources, so creating a Compute access group with `functions: myfuncs*` and `images: myImages*` will match with nothing because a function doesn't contain an image and an image doesn't include a function. 

[.procedure]
. Open Prisma Cloud Console, and log in with your admin credentials.

. Go to *Settings > Resource Lists*.

. Click *Add Resource List*.

.. Select *Compute Access Group*.

.. In the Add Resource List dialog, enter a name, description, and then specify a filter to target specific resources. 

... For example, the access group named 'Compute production hosts only' here gives access to Compute resources filtered on hosts where host name starts with 'production'. 
+
image::saas_assign_roles_resourcelist.png[width=600]
+
For more information on syntax that can be used in the filter fields (e.g., containers, images, hosts, etc), see xref:../configure/rule_ordering_pattern_matching.adoc#[Rule ordering and pattern matching].
+
NOTE: Individual filters on each field in Compute Access group aren't applicable to all views.
For example, a group created with only functions won't include any resources when viewing hosts results.
Similarly, a group created with hosts won't filter images by hosts when viewing image results.


[.task]
==== Assigning Roles to User

Use a combination of the above fields to assign created roles to users

IMPORTANT: If a role allows access to policies, users with this role will be able to see all rules under the Defend section, even if the user’s view of the environment is restricted by assigned Compute Access Groups.

[.procedure]
. Navigate to *Settings > Users*.

. Add new user or search for an existing user.

. Assign role(s) to the user. When a role contains multiple Compute Access groups, the effective scope is the union of each individual query.
+
image::saas_assign_roles_user.png[width=400]
+
NOTE: Changes to a user's Compute access group takes affect at login.
For an active session, newly created Compute Access groups are synced with Compute Console every 30 minutes. 


=== Limitations

Different views in Console are filtered by different resource types.
 
If a Compute Access group specifies resources that are unrelated to the view, Access by this list returns an empty result.

After Compute Access groups are created or updated, there are some views that require a rescan before you can see the change:

* Deployed Images vulnerabilities and compliance views
* Registry Images vulnerabilities and compliance views
* Code repositories vulnerabilities view
* Trusted images 
* Cloud Discovery
* Vulnerability Explorer
* Compliance Explorer

After Compute Access groups are created or updated, there are some views that are affected by the change only for future records.
These views include historical records that keep their collections from creation time:

* Images and Functions CI results view 
* Events views 
* Incidents view
* Image analysis sandbox results view
