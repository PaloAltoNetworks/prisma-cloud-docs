. Make sure that the IP address of Prisma Console in the VPC configuration is public.
. Check if the Defender instance has a public IP address.
. Check if https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/agentless-scanning/onboard-accounts/onboard-aws[AWS account can connect with the Prisma Cloud Console] with Console URL that you selected in the VPC configuration.
.. If the Console is not reachable, delete the rule and create a new rule with a valid Prisma Cloud Console URL.
.. If the Console is not reachable due to a firewall rule or other blocking rules, fix the rule to allow the connectivity to the Console, and click *Update* to retry the deployment.
.. Ensure that the Console's IP address and the ports are reachable by the Defender. Also, the firewall is open with the relevant port and source IPs.
