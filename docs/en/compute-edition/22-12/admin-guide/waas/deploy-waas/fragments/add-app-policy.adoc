. Select a WAAS rule to add an App in.

. Click *Add app*.

. In the *App Definition* tab, enter an *App ID*.
+
NOTE: The combination of *Rule name* and *App ID* must be unique across In-Line and Out-Of-Band WAAS policies for Containers, Hosts, and App-Embedded.
+
If you have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, click *Import*, and select the file to load.
+
If you do not have a Swagger or OpenAPI file, manually define each endpoint by specifying the host, port, and path.
+

.. In *Endpoint Setup*, click *Add Endpoint*.

.. Specify endpoint in your web application that should be protected. Each defined application can have multiple protected endpoints.

.. Enter *HTTP host* (optional, wildcards supported).
+
HTTP hostnames are specified in the form of [hostname]:[external port].
+
The external port is defined as the TCP port on the host, listening for inbound HTTP traffic. If the value of the external port is "80" for non-TLS endpoints or "443" for TLS endpoints it can be omitted. Examples: "*.example.site", "docs.example.site", "www.example.site:8080", etc.

.. Enter *App ports* as the internal port your app listens on (optional, if you selected *Automatically detect ports* while creating the rule). 
+
When *Automatically detect ports* is selected, any ports specified in a protected endpoint definition will be appended to the list of protected ports.
+
Specify the TCP port listening for inbound HTTP traffic.
+
NOTE: If your application uses *TLS* or *gRPC*, you must specify a port number.

.. Enter *Base path* (optional, wildcards supported):
+
Base path for WAAS to match when applying protections.
+
Examples: "/admin", "/" (root path only), "/*", /v2/api", etc.
ifdef::waas_port[]
.. Enter *WAAS port (only required for Windows, App-Embedded or when using xref:../waas_advanced_settings.adoc#remote-host["Remote host"] option)* as the external port WAAS listens on. The external port is the TCP port for the App-Embedded Defender to listen on for inbound HTTP traffic.
+
image::cwp-42473-add-app-waas-port-windows.png[scale=15]
+
NOTE: Protecting Linux-based hosts does not require specifying a *`WAAS port`* since WAAS listens on the same port as the protected application. Because Windows has its own internal traffic routing mechanisms, WAAS and the protected application cannot use the same *`App port`*. Consequently, when protecting Windows-based hosts the *`WAAS port`* should be set to the port end-users send requests to, and the *`App port`* should be set to a *different* port on which the protected application will listen and to which WAAS will forward traffic.
endif::waas_port[]

.. If your application uses TLS, set *TLS* to *On*.
+
You can select the TLS protocol (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for WAAS In-Line, and 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 for WAAS Out-Of-Band) to protect the API endpoint and enter the TLS certificate in PEM format.
+
*Limitations*
+
... TLS connections using extended_master_secret(23) in the negotiation are not supported as part of this feature.

... DHKE is not supported due to a lack of information required to generate the encryption key.

... Out-of-Band does not support HTTP/2 protocol.

... TLS inspection for Out-of-Band WAAS is not supported on earlier versions of Console and Defender.
+
* If your application uses HTTP/2, set *HTTP/2* to *On*.
+
WAAS must be able to decrypt and inspect HTTPS traffic to function properly.
+
* If your application uses gRPC, set *gRPC* to *On*.
ifdef::response_headers[]
.. You can select *Response headers* to add or override HTTP response headers in responses sent from the protected application.
+
image::waas_response_headers.png[width=550]

.. Select *Create response header*.

.. To facilitate inspection, after creating all endpoints, click *View TLS settings* in the endpoint setup menu.

* *Certificate* - Copy and paste your server's certificate and private key into the certificate input box (e.g., `cat server-cert.pem server-key > certs.pem`).
+
ifdef::advanced_tls[]
* *Minimum TLS version* - A minimum version of TLS can be enforced by WAAS In-Line to prevent downgrading attacks (the default value is TLS 1.2).
+
* *HSTS* - The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)] response header lets web servers tell browsers to use HTTPS only, not HTTP.
When enabled, WAAS would add the HSTS response header to all HTTPS server responses (if it is not already present) with the preconfigured directives - `max-age`, `includeSubDomains`, and `preload`.
+
... `max-age=<expire-time>` - Time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be accessed using HTTPS.
+
... `includeSubDomains` (optional) - If selected, HSTS protection applies to all the site's subdomains as well.
+
... `preload` (optional) - For more details, see the following https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security#preloading_strict_transport_security[link].
