== Twistcli sandbox run third-party assessment tool.

In the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-release-notes/release-information[Lagrange release (v22.12+)] the xref:../runtime_defense/image_analysis_sandbox.adoc[twistcli image analysis sandbox] capability allows for the execution of third-party assessment tools.
You can supply a third-party binary/script that is executed after the twistcli sandbox image analysis is completed.
The output of the third-party tool can be captured within a volume mount for further analysis.
Twistcli sandbox analysis occurs within a temporary container of the image under examination.
No modifications are made to the image under analysis.

In this example we will use the https://www.open-scap.org/[OpenSCAP] utility to perform a https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/products/rhel8/profiles/stig.profile[Compliance as Code's v0.1.65 RHEL-8 STIG profile] scan of a https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi/5c359854d70cc534b3a3784e[RedHat Universal Base Image 8].


[.procedure]

. On the host on which the twistcli sandbox analysis will occur create a directory `/opt/sandbox`.

. Download the https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases[latest ComplianceAsCode release], extract `ssg-rhel8-ds.xml` and copy to the `/opt/sandbox` directory.

. Copy the following bash script to `/opt/sandbox/openscap_analysis.sh`.
+
----
#!/bin/bash
# Install tools and OpenSCAP
yum update -y -q
yum install -y -q openscap-scanner

# Run OpenSCAP scan
# Note: HTML and XML OSCAP output files are written to the host mounted directory
oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig --report /opt/sandbox/openscap_sandbox_stig.html --results /opt/sandbox/openscap_sandbox_stig.xml /opt/sandbox/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----

. Set the executable flag on openscap_analysis.sh.

  $ chmod +x openscap_analysist.sh

. Execute twistcli sandbox analysis of the ubi:8.7-1037 image with the following command:

  linux/twistcli sandbox \
  --address https://127.0.0.1:8083 \
  --volume /opt/sandbox:/opt/sandbox \
  --third-party-delay 5s \
  --third-party-cmd /opt/sandbox/openscap_analysis.sh \
  --third-party-output /opt/sandbox/oscap-results.txt \
  registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.7-1037
+
Where:
+
* `--volume /opt/sandbox:/opt/sandbox` - mounts the host's /opt/sandbox directory into the running container's /opt/sandbox.
The files necessary to execute the OpenSCAP scan are read from this directory and the output of the script is written to this directory.
* `--third-party-delay 5s` - time delay after the sandbox analysis completes and the third party script is executed.
* `--third-party-output /opt/sandbox/oscap-results.txt` - path to output results.

. The following output files are written to the host's /opt/sandbox directory:
+
* openscap_sandbox_stig.html - OSCAP report output.
* openscap_sandbox_stig.xml - OSCAP results output.
* oscap-results.txt - stdout captured during the execution of openscap_analysis.sh.
