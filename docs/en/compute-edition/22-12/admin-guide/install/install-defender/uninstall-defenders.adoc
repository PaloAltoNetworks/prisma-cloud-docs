[.task] 
== Uninstall Defenders

To uninstall Prisma Cloud, delete the `twistlock` namespace.
Deleting this namespace deletes every resource within the namespace.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
When you delete the `twistlock` namespace, you also delete the persistent volume (PV) in the namespace.
By default, the Prisma Cloud Console stores its data in that PV.
When the PV is deleted, all data is lost, and you can't restore the Prisma Cloud Console.
