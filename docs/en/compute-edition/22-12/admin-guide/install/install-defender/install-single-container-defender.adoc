== Install a single Container Defender

Install Container Defender on each host that you want Prisma Cloud to protect.

Single Container Defenders can be configured in the Prisma Cloud Console (PCC) UI, and then deployed with a curl-bash script.
Alternatively, you can use twistcli to configure and deploy Defender directly on a host.

[.task]
=== Install a single Container Defender (PCC UI)

Configure how a single Container Defender will be installed, and then install it with the resulting curl-bash script.

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../system_requirements.adoc[system requirements].
* Ensure your host can access PCC through the network.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
** You have already xref:../getting_started.adoc[installed PCC].
** Port 8083 is open on the host where PCC runs.
Port 8083 serves the API.
Port 8083 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing PCC.
When deploying Defender you can configure it to communicate to PCC via a proxy.
** Port 8084 is open on the host where PCC runs.
PCC and Defender communicate with each other over a web socket on port 8084.
Defender initiates the connection.
Port 8084 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing PCC.
Defender can also be configured to communicate to PCC via a proxy.
endif::compute_edition[]
ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
** Port 443 is open for outgoing traffic from your host.
endif::prisma_cloud[]
* You have sudo access to the host where you want to deploy the Defender.

[.procedure]
. Verify that the host machine where you install Defender can connect to the Prisma Cloud console.

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
.. Copy the path to the value under *Path to Console* from *Compute > Manage > System > Utilities*.
.. Complete the following command with copied value.
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host system.
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to PCC.

. Go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders* and select *Manual deploy*.
endif::prisma_cloud[]
ifdef::compute_edition[]
.. Copy the path to the value under *Path to Console* from *Manage > System > Utilities*.
.. Complete the following command with copied value.
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host system.
+
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to PCC.
+
If you customized the setup when you installed PCC, you might need to specify a different port.

. Go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders* and select *Manual deploy*.
endif::compute_edition[]

. Under *Deployment method*, select *Single Defender*.

. Select your desired *Defender type*

. Under *The name that Defender will use to connect to this Console*, select the correct item from the list of IP addresses and hostnames pre-populated in the drop-down list.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
* If none of the items are valid, xref:../../configure/subject_alternative_names.adoc[add a new Subject Alternative Name (SAN)] to Prisma Cloud. After adding a SAN, your IP address or hostname will be available in the drop-down list.
+
[NOTE]
====
Selecting an IP address in a evaluation setup is acceptable, but using a DNS name is more resilient.
If you select PCC's IP address, and PCC's IP address changes, your Defenders will no longer be able to communicate with PCC.
====
endif::compute_edition[]

. Under *Defender and Console communication* enter the following optional configuration.

.. Set a custom communication port for the Defender to use.

..  Set a proxy for the Defender to use for the communication with the Prisma Cloud console.

. Under *Advanced Settings*, you can enter the following additional network configurations.

.. Select the xref:../../access_control/rbac.adoc#_defender_listener_type[listener type]. The default setting is *None*.

.. Set *Assign globally unique names to Hosts* to *ON* when you have multiple hosts that can have the same hostname.
+
[NOTE]
====
After setting the toggle to *ON*, Prisma Cloud appends a unique identifier, such as ResourceId, to the host's DNS name.
For example, an AWS EC2 host would have the following name: `Ip-171-29-1-244.ec2internal-i-04a1dcee6bd148e2d`.
====

. Copy the install command from the *Installation* sidebar. The script is generated according to the options you selected.

. On the host where you want to install Defender, paste the command into a shell window, and run it.

[.task]
=== Install a single Container Defender using the CLI

Use the `twistcli` CLI tool to install a single Container Defender on a Linux host.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
[NOTE]
====
Anywhere `<PATH-TO-CONSOLE>` is used, be sure to specify both the address and port number for PCC's API.
By default, the port is 8083.
For example, `\<PATH-TO-CONSOLE>:8083`.

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../system_requirements.adoc[system requirements].
ifdef::compute_edition[]
** You have already xref:../getting_started.adoc[installed the Prisma Cloud Console (PCC)].
** Port 8083 is open on the host where PCC runs.
Port 8083 serves the API.
Port 8083 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing Console.
When deploying Defender you can configure it to communicate to PCC via a proxy.
** Port 8084 is open on the host where PCC runs.
PCC and Defender communicate with each other over a web socket on port 8084.

endif::prisma_cloud[]
* You have sudo access to the host where you want to deploy the Defender.
* You've created a service account with the Defender Manager role.
twistcl uses the service account to access PCC.

[.procedure]

. Verify that the host where you install Defender can connect to the Prisma Cloud console.

ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
.. Replace `<PATH-TO-CONSOLE>` with the path found under *Path to Console* from *Compute > Manage > System > Utilities*.

curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping

sudo ./twistcli defender install standalone container-linux \
  --address https://<CONSOLE> \
  --user <USER>
----

. Verify Defender was installed correctly.

[.task]
=== Verify the install

Verify that Defender is installed and connected to the Prisma Cloud console.

[NOTE]
====
Defender can be deployed and run with full functionality when dockerd is configured with SELinux enabled (--selinux-enabled=true).
All features will work normally and without any additional configuration steps required.
Prisma Cloud automatically detects the SELinux configuration on a per-host basis and self-configures itself as needed.
No action is needed from the user.
====

// It would be useful to add a troubleshooting section here.
// First step: Go to the host, and validate that the Defender container is actually running.
// Need to provide steps for each Defender type (Linux Server, Windows Server, Windows Container Host).
// Verify that Defender is running on the host.
//
//  $ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}" | grep defender
//  twistlock_defender: Up 7 minutes

[.procedure]
. In the Prisma Cloud console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.
