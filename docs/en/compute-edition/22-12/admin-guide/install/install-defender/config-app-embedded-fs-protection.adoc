== Default setting for App-Embedded Defender file system protection

Because App-Embedded Defender's file system protection could affect workload performance, you can enable or disable it.

This procedure is intended for security teams that want to set a global recommendation for whether file system protection should be enabled when teams deploy App-Embedded Defenders.

By default, file system protection is disabled in App-Embedded Defenders.
Security teams can turn it on by default so that teams that build and manage apps will deploy Defender according to your organization's best practices.
Individual teams can optionally override the default setting at embed-time, and they may want to do so if file system protection interferes with their workload's operation.
