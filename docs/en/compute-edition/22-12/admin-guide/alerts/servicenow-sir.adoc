== ServiceNow alerts for Security Incident Response

ServiceNow is a workflow management platform.
It offers a number of security operations applications.
You can configure Prisma Cloud to route alerts to ServiceNow's Security Incident Response application.

Prisma Cloud audits are mapped to a ServiceNow security incident as follows:

* Audits and incidents are mapped to individual ServiceNow security incidents.
* Vulnerabilities are aggregated by resource (currently image) and mapped to individual ServiceNow security incidents.
ServiceNow short description field lists the resource.
ServiceNow description field lists the details of each finding.
* Compliance issues are aggregated by resource (image/container/host) and mapped to individual ServiceNow security incidents.
ServiceNow short description field lists the resource.
ServiceNow description field lists the details of each finding.

NOTE: Compliance alerts will be sent to ServiceNow in real time (right after compliance scan), unlike the other alert providers which send compliance alerts every 24 hours.

NOTE: Compliance alerts will be sent if the resource is new, or if there's a difference in the number of compliance issues for this resource after its scan. All the compliance issues of the resource will be sent (not only the new ones).

|ServiceNow security incident
|Field description
|Prisma Cloud audit data

|State

Upon security incident creation, this field defaults to Draft.
|Draft (automatically set by ServiceNow)

|Priority
|Select the order in which to address this security incident, based on the urgency. If this value is changed after the record is saved, it can affect the Business impact calculation.
|Vulnerabilities: Max severity from the image’s new vulnerabilities.
ServiceNow's priorities map one-to-one to Prisma Cloud severities (Critical - Critical, High - High, Medium - Medium, Low - Low).

Compliance: Max severity from the image/container/host’s compliance issues.
ServiceNow's priorities map one-to-one to Prisma Cloud severities (Critical - Critical, High - High, Medium - Medium, Low - Low).

Incidents and audits: runtime audits priority set in the alert profile.

|Business impact

=== Sending findings to ServiceNow

Alert profiles specify which events trigger the alert machinery, and to which channel alerts are sent.
You can send alerts to any combination of channels by creating multiple alert profiles.

Alert profiles consist of two parts:

*(1) Alert settings -- Who should get the alerts, and on what channel?*
Configure Prisma Cloud to integrate with ServiceNow and specify the people or places where alerts should be sent.
You can specify assignees and assignment groups.

*(2) Alert triggers -- Which events should trigger an alert to be sent?*
Specify which of the rules that make up your overall policy should trigger alerts.

[.task]
=== Create new alert profile

Create a new alert profile.

[.procedure]
. In *Manage > Alerts*, click *Add profile*.

. Enter a name for your alert profile.

. In *Provider*, select *ServiceNow*.


[.task]
=== Configure the channel

Configure Prisma Cloud to send alerts to ServiceNow, then validate the setup by sending a test alert.

*Prerequisites:* You've created a service account in ServiceNow with a base role of web_service_admin.

[.procedure]
. In *Application*, select *Security Incident Response*.

. In *URL*, specify the base URL of your ServiceNow tenant.
+
For example, `\https://ena03291.service-now.com`

. In *Credential*, click *Add New*.

.. In *Type*, select *Basic authentication*.
+
This is currently the only auth method supported.

.. Enter a username and password.

. (Optional) In *Assignee*, enter the name of a user in ServiceNow that will be assigned the security incident.
+
This value isn't case sensitive.

. (Mandatory) In *Assignment Group*, enter the name of a group in ServiceNow that will be assigned the security incident.
The default value is *Security Incident Assignment*.
+
If *Assignment Group* is set without speciying *Assignee*, the first user from the group is set on the security incident (ServiceNow's logic).
+
If the *Assignee* set in the profile isn't a part of the *Assignment Group*, the security incident won't be created (ServiceNow's logic).

. (Optional) In *CA certificate*, enter a CA certificate in PEM format.
Relevant only for on-premises deployments of ServiceNow.

. Click *Send Test Alert*.
If everything looks good, and you get an alert in ServiceNow, save the profile.
