== JIRA Alerts

Prisma Cloud continually scans your environment for vulnerabilities using the threat data in the Intelligence Stream.
Prisma Cloud can open JIRA issues when new vulnerabilities are detected in your environment.
This mechanism lets you implement continuous vulnerability assessment and remediation by hooking directly into the developer's workflow.

New JIRA issues are opened when new vulnerabilities are found.
Issues are opened on a per-image basis.
Each  JIRA issue lists the new vulnerabilities discovered, and a list of vulnerabilities that have already been reported but were still detected.

JIRA issues are opened based on policy.
For example, an issue would be created when all of the following conditions are met:

* You have a rule that alerts on critical vulnerabilities,
* The rule is associated with your JIRA alert profile,
* The Prisma Cloud scanner finds a critical vulnerability in an image in your environment.

The following screenshot shows an example JIRA issue opened by Prisma Cloud.

=== Intelligent issue routing

You can leverage image labels to intelligently route alerts to the right team, and eliminate manual ticket triage.
For example, if team-a is responsible for image-a, and a vulnerability is found in image-a, you could set up the alert to flow directly to team-a's JIRA queue.

Intelligent routing depends on a Prisma Cloud feature called xref:../audit/annotate_audits.adoc#[alert labels], where you define labels that Prisma Cloud should watch.
When rules trigger, Prisma Cloud extracts the value of the label from the resource, and applies it to the next phase of alert processing.
For JIRA alerts, you can use labels to specify the JIRA project key, JIRA labels, and JIRA issue assignee.

For example, if you have an image with the following labels:

  group=front-end-group
  team=client-team
  business-app=my-business-app

You could configure Prisma Cloud to open issues about this specific image in the JIRA project defined by the _group_ label.

[.task]
=== Create new alert profile

Create a new alert profile.

[.procedure]
. In *Manage > Alerts*, click *Add profile*.

. Enter a name for your alert profile.

. In *Provider*, select *JIRA*.


[.task]
=== Configure the channel

Configure the channel.

[.procedure]
. In *Base URL*, specify the location of your JIRA service.

. In *Credential*, create the credentials required to access the account.

.. Click *Add new*.

.. Select *Basic authentication*.

.. Enter a username and password.
+
NOTE: If you are using Jira Cloud, this will be an email address and API token respectively. You can generate your API token https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens[here].

.. Click *Save*.

. In *CA certificate*, enter a copy of the CA certificate in PEM format.

. In *Project key*, enter a project key.
+
Alternatively, you can dynamically specify the project key based on a label.
When an alert fires, the project key is taken from the label of the resource that triggered the action.
To do so, click *Select labels...*, and choose a label that you know will contain the project key.
If there are no labels in the drop-down list, go to *Manage > Alerts > Alert Labels*, and define them.

. Enter an issue type.

. Enter a priority.

. Enter a comma delimited list of JIRA labels to apply to the issue.
+
You can dynamically define the list from a label.
Click *Select labels...*, and select one or more labels.

. Enter an assignee for the new issue.
+
You can dynamically define the assignee from a label.
Click *Select labels...*, and select one or more labels.

. Click *Send Test Alert* to test the connection.
