==  Upgrade the Defender DaemonSets from Console

Upgrade the Defender DaemonSets directly from the Console UI.

If you can't access your cluster with kubectl or oc, then you can upgrade Defender DaemonSets directly from the Console UI.

*Prerequisites:* You've created a xref:~/authentication/credentials-store/kubernetes-credentials.adoc[kubeconfig credential] for your cluster so that Prisma Cloud can access it to upgrade the Defender DaemonSet.

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage*.

. Click *DaemonSets*.

. For each cluster in the table, click *Actions > Upgrade*.
+
The table shows a count of deployed Defenders and their new version number.
