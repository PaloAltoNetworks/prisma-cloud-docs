== Configure Registry Scans

Prisma Cloud can scan container images in public and private repositories on public and private registries.

A registry is a system that stores and distributes container images.
You can use Prisma Cloud to scan registries from different public registry providers such as DockerHub, Amazon, Google, and your internal private registries.

After you configure repository scanning, Prisma Cloud automatically scans images for vulnerabilities.
By default, scans occur once every 24 hours, but you can configure periodic scans at specific intervals specified in *Manage > System > Scan*.

You can scan all registries or select multiple registries to scan in parallel, thus reducing the scan time.
By default, the registry scan limit is set to scan 4 registries at a time.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
Prisma Cloud can scan upto 9 registries in parallel. The new registry scans wait in a queue, until the previous scan completes.

Note: You can configure this default registry scan limit from 4 to scan up to 9 registries by editing the `REGISTRY_SCANNERS` variable in the `twistlock.cfg` file.
endif::compute_edition[]

//If you use the `/settings/registry` API to manage registry scanning, you can use the `scanLater` flag when using the `PUT` or `POST` methods to decide whether to initiate a scan after saving or not. By default, Prisma Cloud initiates a scan.

=== Configure Prisma Cloud to Scan a Registry

To scan images in a registry, create a new registry scan rule.

*Prerequisites:* You have xref:../../install/deploy-defender/defender-types.adoc[deployed at least one Defender in your environment].

[.procedure]
. On the Prisma Cloud console, go to *Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registry settings*.

. Review the available <<registry-scan-settings, settings>>.

. If the default values don't fit your scenario, select *Add registry*.

. Enter the registry fields, then select *Add and scan*.
+
This triggers a registry scan and you can view the progress notification at the top right corner with a list of registries (`<registry>/repository:tag`) being scanned.
//+
//If a registry scan is already in progress, you can stop the in-progress scan and start scanning for the latest changes using *Scan now*.
//+
//Or, you can select *Save only* to continue with the in-progress scan and save the latest changes. Once the current scan is complete, you can either manually trigger the latest scan or wait for the next scheduled scan.
+

[.task]
=== Registry Scan Results

Verify that the images in the repository are being scanned.

NOTE: You can add a maximum of 19,999 registry entries in **Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registry settings**. 

[.procedure]
. Go to *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registries*.
+
You can choose to *Scan all registries* or *Select registries* (multiple registries) to *Scan*.
+
As the scan of each image is completed, its findings are added to the results table.

. Select an image to get details about the vulnerabilities in an image.
+
To force a specific repository to be scanned again, select *Scan* from the top right of the results table, then select a specific registry to re-scan. Alternatively, you can also scan an individual registry by selecting *Scan* next to the registry.
+
If the registry scans are already in progress, the newly added registry is queued until the previous registry scan finishes, the available Defender is then assigned to scan the very next registry in the queue.
+
The *Last scan time* of a registry is updated under *Registry details > General info*.

==== On-demand Registry Scans

You can trigger an on-demand scan for individual images with the https://pan.dev/compute/api/post-registry-scan/[Scan Registry API]. This feature allows you to scan the images immediately and not wait for the next periodic scan. You can trigger multiple on-demand image scans without interrupting the main registry scanning process. 
However, every trigger is for a single image only.

NOTE: For an on-demand scan, you must pre-define the image registry scope in the xref:registry-scanning.adoc[registry scanning configuration].

[#deployment-patterns]
=== Deployment Patterns

Defenders handle registry scanning.
When you configure registry scanning, you can select the scope of Defenders used to perform the scans.

Any xref:../../install/deploy-defender/defender-types.adoc[Container Defender] running on a host with the Docker Engine container runtime or container runtime interface (CRI) can scan a registry, and any number of them can simultaneously operate as registry scanners.
This flexibility gives you a lot of options when trying to determine how to cover disparate environments.

You can use host names or AWS tags to select a collection of Defenders to distribute the scanning job between them, and use the *Number of scanners* setting to control how many Defenders are included in the collection.
When you select *All* collection, Prisma Cloud automatically distributes the scan job across all available Defenders.

Configuring Prisma Cloud to use a large number of Defenders reduces operational complexity and improves resiliency.
During a scan, Prisma Cloud lists the available Defenders based on the configured scope, manages the resource pool, and handles issues such as restarting partially completed jobs. 
If you explicitly select one or two Defenders to handle the registry scan, the hosts running those Defenders become a single point of failure. If that host fails or gets destroyed, you have to reconfigure your scan settings with different Defenders.

The type of operating system (OS) scopes registry scanning.
Windows Defenders only scan Windows images, and Linux Defenders only scan Linux images.

When you remove an image from the registry or the registry becomes unavailable, Prisma Cloud maintains the scan results for a specific number of days.
You can configure the number of days under *Manage > System > Scan > Registry scan results*.
After the specified number of days, the scan results are purged.

[#registry-scan-steps]
=== Registry Scan Steps

At a high level, Defenders scan your registries following these steps.

//. Scan registry settings one by one in sequential order.
. Scan multiple registries in parallel, the default value is set to scan 4 registries at a time.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
Note: You can configure this default registry scan limit from 4 to scan up to 9 registries by editing the `REGISTRY_SCANNERS` variable in the `twistlock.cfg` file.
endif::compute_edition[]
. Discover the repositories based on your registry configuration.
. Discover the images using tags within each configured repository.
. Scan the discovered images.

In more detail, Defenders scanning your registries follow this sequential flow to collect the metadata.

. Get a list of all repositories in the registry.

. For each repository, scanning Defenders perform the following tasks.
  * Get a list of all image tags.
  * For each image tag, they get the image manifest containing the date the image was last modified.

. Once the metadata of all images is discovered, scanning Defenders perform the following tasks.
   * Sort the images by the last modified date.
   * Cap the list of images based on the configured value. By default, lists are capped at five.
   * Scan the images.

//https://redlock.atlassian.net/browse/PCSUP-11741 - Maxwell Update 1
The Console manages the current scan state and distributes the work to Defenders.

* If a Defender is disconnected during the scan, the Console assigns the scan task to another Defender and continues to scan the resources.

* When the Console is updated, the periodic scan restarts.

* When the Console loses communication with the Defender, the Defender continues to defend the nodes and reports the results to the Console when the communication with the Console resumes.

[#registry-scan-settings]
=== Registry Scan Settings

You can set the following parameters for each rule, but the parameters can vary between registry types.
If you use a specific registry provider, follow the appropriate step-by-step instructions in xref:registry-scanning.adoc[our guides].

[cols="15%,85%a", options="header"]

|Repositories to exclude (Optional)
|Specify repository names to exclude.
Enter the repository name or pattern to exclude that repository from being scanned. Leave this field blank to scan all repositories.

|Tag (Optional)
|Specify an image tag.
Leave this field blank to scan all tags (limited by the value in Cap).

|Tags to exclude (Optional)
|Specify tags to exclude.
Leave blank to exclude all image tags (default).

|Credentials
|Specify the credentials required to access the registry.
If the credentials have already been created in the Prisma Cloud credential store, select it.
If not, click *Add New*.

*Public repositories on public registries (such as Docker Hub):*
Leave this field blank.
No credentials are required.

*Registries that support token authentication (such as, Quary, and GitLab):*
Create a *Basic authentication* credential.
_Username_ is the name of the token and the token value is entered into the _password_ field.
[NOTE]
====
To scan a *GitLab* registry, configure the registry in Prisma Cloud as a *GitLab Container Registry*.

You can use GitLab personal access token to scan a GitLab registry.
====

|CA certificate (Optional)
|Enter a CA certificate in PEM format to allow Prisma Cloud to validate the registry.

Custom CA certificate validation is supported only for non-docker nodes (for example, OpenShift), and for the following Cloud providers:

- Docker registry v2
- JFrog Artifactory (On-prem)
- Harbor
- Sonatype Nexus
+
**Note:** Certificate revocation checking for the registry's certificate is your responsibility to ensure that the certificate is not revoked by the issuing authority.
+
Only Defenders running with CRI runtime support custom CA certificate configuration.
+
[NOTE]
====
Place the CA certificate (`ca.cert`) file in any of the following paths. The Defender searches for the certificate files in the below directories in the following precedence:

`/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`

`/etc/containers/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`

`/etc/containerd/certs.d/<registry-URL>/`
====

|OS Type
|Specify whether the image is built on a Windows or Linux-based OS.

|Scanners scope
|Select collections of Defenders to scan this registry.

Only Linux Defenders can scan Linux container images, and only Windows Defenders can scan Windows container images.
App-Embedded Defenders can't be used for registry scanning.

|Number of scanners
|Number of Defenders from the scope across which the scan job can be distributed.
Increase the number of Defenders to increase throughput and reduce scan time.

|Cap (Capacity)
|Specify the maximum number of images to scan in the given repository, sorted according to the last modified date. A repository is a collection of different docker images with the same name, that have different tags. That is, the most recently modified image in each repository is scanned first, followed by the image next most recently modified, and so on.

With a cap of five, scanning Defenders fetch the five most recently modified images from each repository in the registry. In other words, for each image in the registry, we will include the 5 latest versions. 

The Docker Registry API does not support directly querying for the most recently updated images.
To handle your CAP setting, Prisma Cloud first polls the registry for all tags and manifests in the given repository to discover the last updated dates.
This is a low-overhead operation because images do not need to be downloaded.
Prisma Cloud then sorts the results by date and then scans the most recently updated images in each repository up to the limit specified by CAP.
Even when CAP is set to a low number, you might still notice the Prisma Cloud UI polling the registry for data about the images in the repository.

To scan all images in a repository, set CAP to 0.

|Version matching pattern
|Customize sort order by values in the image tag.
Specify a pattern from which a version or date can be extracted from the image tag.
There are two use cases for specifying version-matching patterns:

* You want to reduce the total time it takes to complete the scan for very large registries.
Rather than fetching the metadata from the registry required to sort images, you specify how the scanner can extract the metadata directly from the image tag.
* You want to order and cap the images to be scanned by some value other than the last modified date.

Specify patterns with strings, wildcards, time/date elements, and integers.

* `%d` - version number
* `%Y` - 4 digit year
* `%M` - 2 digit month
* `%D` - 2 digit day
* `%H` - 2 digit hour
* `%m` - 2 digit minute
* `%s` - 2 digit second

For image tags that match the pattern, the tag is split into its constituent parts.
After all image tags are parsed, they're ordered and capped according to the value set in Cap.

Ordering is the best-effort.
Tags that don't conform to the pattern are ignored.

If both date and version are specified in your pattern, the date takes precedence.

If the version matching pattern is left unspecified, Prisma Cloud orders images by the last modified date.

|===

To scan a small set of registries that contain a small set of images, use a VM host with a single container Defender optimized to scan the target registries. 

=== Registries with a Large Scale

For larger registries, optimize your scan configuration to maximize throughput and minimize scan time.
Defenders scan registries parallely following <<registry-scan-steps,specific steps>>.
The following best practices help you improve your registry scanning speed.

* If you have large registries or need aggressive scan intervals, increase the number of scanners in the scope.
+
The number of scanning Defenders should increase with the registry size. As the number of images in the registry increases, so does the number of Defenders scanning this registry.

* Use the default cap value of five in your registry scan configuration.
+
The cap value impacts the duration of the scan. Large-cap values lead to longer scan times since more images are scanned.

* Use a version-matching pattern in your registry scan configuration. Only use version pattern matching for deployments with very large registries containing tens of thousands of repositories and millions of images.
+
If you specify a version matching pattern, the scanner looks to the image tag for sort order.
Without a version-matching pattern, images are sorted by the last modified date.
With a version-matching pattern, you configure how image tags are sorted.
Using semantic versioning in your image names, you can specify the following version pattern:
+
[source]
----
*-%d.%d.%d
----
+
This optimized flow to collect metadata eliminates the sorting loop and substantially reduces the number of requests. Then, Defenders can start scanning the registry sooner.
The simplified flow is as follows.
+
  . Get a list of all repos in the registry.
+
  . For each repository, scanning Defenders perform the following tasks.
    * Get a list of all image tags
+
  . Once the metadata of all images is discovered, scanning Defenders perform the following tasks.
     * Sort the images by last modified date.
     * Cap the list of images based on the configured value. By default, lists are capped at five.
     * Scan the images.
+
A repository with three images, configured with a cap of `2`, and a version pattern of `*-%d.%d.%d`, produces the following set of images to be scanned.
+
[source]
----
  myimage-3.0.0 <<<--- Image scanned
  myimage-2.0.1 <<<--- Image scanned
  myimage-2.0.0 (Not scanned)
----

//* When you have multiple registries, create multiple collections of defender scanners.
//+
//Each registry should have dedicated Defenders to perform the scanning.
//If a 1:1 ratio of collections to registries isn't feasible, create as many collections as possible to split the load. 
//Don't reuse the same collection for all registries.
//+
//This best practice prevents the scenario where a single Defender performs too many queries to the registry provider API.
//If too many queries are made during repository or tag discovery, providers could throttle the Defender. 
* When you have multiple registries to scan, create a dedicated collection of Defenders with the scope for each registry scan profile. Ensure that the Defenders are able to reach the defined registry. To improve throughput and reduce scan time, you can increase the number of Defenders in the collection.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
+
This dedicated collection of Defenders will target all the registries and scan them in parallel as per the registry scan limit configured in the `twistlock.cfg` file.
endif::compute_edition[]
+
This dedicated collection of Defenders will target all the registries and scan them in parallel as per the registry scan limit configured in `twistlock.cfg` file.

* Properly dimension the hardware running your Defenders.
+
Ensure the xref:../../install/system-requirements.adoc#hardware[hardware system requirements] for Defenders scanning registries are met.

* Colocate scanning Defenders in the same region as the registry.
+
This best practice minimizes network latency since the Defenders run in the same region as your registries.

=== Additional Scan Settings

You can find additional scan settings under *Manage > System > Scan*, where you can set the xref:../../configure/configure-scan-intervals.adoc#[registry scan interval].

The *Manage > System > Scan* page has an option called *Only scan images with running containers*.
This option does not apply to registry scanning. All images included in your registry scanning rule are scanned regardless of the setting to *Only scan images with running containers*.

=== CRI and containerd-only Environments

Prisma Cloud fully supports scanning CRI and containerd-only environments.

=== Registry Scanning Limitations

When scanning registries, consider the following constraints.

* Defenders only scan the operating system images that match the OS of the system running them.
+
For example, a Defender running on a Linux host can only scan Linux images and won't scan Windows images.

* Defenders running on Linux only scan images suited for the hardware architecture that matches the architecture of the system running them.
+
For example, a Defender running on x86_64 architecture with Linux can only scan images for x86_64 systems with Linux.
Similarly, a Defender running on ARM64 architecture with Linux can only scan images for ARM64 systems with Linux.
You can't mix Linux ARM64 and Linux x86_64 Defenders within the same registry scanning scope.
