== Install a Single Container Defender

Install Container Defender on each host that you want Prisma Cloud to protect.

Single Container Defenders can be configured in the Console UI, and then deployed with a curl-bash script.
Alternatively, you can use xref:./single-defender-cli.adoc[twistcli to configure] and deploy Defender directly on a host.

=== Install a single Container Defender (Console UI)

Configure how a single Container Defender will be installed, and then install it with the resulting curl-bash script.

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../../system-requirements.adoc[system requirements].
* Ensure that the host machine where you installed the Defender can access the Prisma Cloud console the network.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
** You have already xref:../../getting-started.adoc[installed Console].
** Port 8083 is open on the host where Console runs.
Port 8083 serves the API.
Port 8083 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing Console.
When deploying Defender you can configure it to communicate to Console via a proxy.
** Port 8084 is open on the host where Console runs.
Console and Defender communicate with each other over a web socket on port 8084.
Defender initiates the connection.
Port 8084 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing Console.
Defender can also be configured to communicate to Console via a proxy.
endif::compute_edition[]
ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
** Port 443 is open for outgoing traffic from your host.
endif::prisma_cloud[]
* You have sudo access to the host where you want to deploy the Defender.

. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Utilities* and copy the *Path to Console*.
.. Run the following command by replacing the variable `PATH-TO-CONSOLE` with the copied value:
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host system.
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.

If you customized the setup when you installed Console, you might need to specify a different port.

.. Under *Deployment method*, select *Single Defender*.

.. In *Defender type*, select *Container Defender - Linux* or *Container Defender - Windows*.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
.. Select the way Defender connects to Console.
+
A list of IP addresses and hostnames are pre-populated in the drop-down list.
If none of the items are valid, go to *Manage > Defenders > Names*, and add a new Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to Console's certificate.
After adding a SAN, your IP address or hostname will be available in the drop-down list.
+
NOTE: Selecting an IP address in a evaluation setup is acceptable, but using a DNS name is more resilient.
If you select Console's IP address, and Console's IP address changes, your Defenders will no longer be able to communicate with Console.
endif::compute_edition[]

.. (Optional) Set a custom communication port (4) for the Defender to use.

.. (Optional) Set a proxy (3) for the Defender to use for the communication with the Console.

.. (Optional) Under *Advanced Settings*, Enable *Assign globally unique names to Hosts* when you have multiple hosts that can have the same hostname (like autoscale groups, and overlapping IP addresses). 
+
NOTE: After setting the option to *ON*, Prisma Cloud appends a unique identifier, such as ResourceId, to the host's DNS name.
For example, an AWS EC2 host would have the following name: Ip-171-29-1-244.ec2internal-i-04a1dcee6bd148e2d.

.. Copy the install scripts command from the right side panel, which is generated according to the options you selected. On the host where you want to install Defender, paste the command into a shell window, and run it.

[.task]
=== Verify the Install

Verify that the Defender is installed and connected to Console.

NOTE: Defender can be deployed and run with full functionality when dockerd is configured with SELinux enabled (--selinux-enabled=true).
All features will work normally and without any additional configuration steps required.
Prisma Cloud automatically detects the SELinux configuration on a per-host basis and self-configures itself as needed.
No action is needed from the user.

// It would be useful to add a troubleshooting section here.
// First step: Go to the host, and validate that the Defender container is actually running.
// Need to provide steps for each Defender type (Linux Server, Windows Server, Windows Container Host).
// Verify that Defender is running on the host.
//
//  $ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}" | grep defender
//  twistlock_defender: Up 7 minutes

[.procedure]
. In Console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Defenders: Deployed*.

Your new Defender should be listed in the table, and the status box should be green and checked.
