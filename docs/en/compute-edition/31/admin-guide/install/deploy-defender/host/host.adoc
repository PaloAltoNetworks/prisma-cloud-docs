== Install a Single Host Defender

Install Host Defender on each host that you want Prisma Cloud to protect.

Single Host Defenders can be configured in the Console UI, and then deployed with a curl-bash script.
Alternatively, you can use `twistcli` to configure and deploy Defender directly on a host.

=== Install a Host Defender (Console UI)

Host Defenders are installed with a curl-bash script.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
NOTE: When you use `<CONSOLE>` in the path, you must specify both the address and the port number (default: 8083) for the Console API.
For example, `\https://<CONSOLE>:8083`.
endif::compute_edition[]

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../../system-requirements.adoc[system requirements].
* Ensure that the host machine where you installed the Defender can access the Prisma Cloud console the network.
* You have `sudo` access to the host where Defender will be installed.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
* You have already xref:../../getting-started.adoc[installed Console]
* Port 8084 is open on the host where Defender runs. Console and Defender communicate with each other over a web socket on port 8084 (by default the communication port is set to 8084 - however, you can specify your own custom port when deploying a Defender).

. Go to *Compute > Manage > System > Utilities* and copy the *Path to Console*.
.. Run the following command by replacing the variable `PATH-TO-CONSOLE` with the copied value:
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host system.
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.

. Go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Defenders: Deployed* and select *Manual deploy*.

. Go to *Manage > System > Utilities* and copy the *Path to Console*.
.. Run the following command by replacing the variable `PATH-TO-CONSOLE` with the copied value:
+
[source]
----
curl -sk -D - <PATH-TO-CONSOLE>:8083/api/v1/_ping
----

.. Run the command on your host system.
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.
If you customized the setup when you installed Console, you might need to specify a different port.

. Go to *Compute > Manage > Defenders > Defenders: Deployed* and select *Manual deploy*.
endif::compute_edition[]

.. Under *Deployment method*, select *Single Defender*.

.. In *Defender type*, select *Host Defender - Linux* or *Host Defender - Windows*.
ifdef::compute_edition[]
.. Select the way Defender connects to Console.
+
A list of IP addresses and hostnames are pre-populated in the drop-down list.
If none of the items are valid, go to *Manage > Defenders > Names*, and add a new Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to Console's certificate.
After adding a SAN, your IP address or hostname will be available in the drop-down list.
+
NOTE: Selecting an IP address in a evaluation setup is acceptable, but using a DNS name is more resilient.
If you select Console's IP address, and Console's IP address changes, your Defenders will no longer be able to communicate with Console.
endif::compute_edition[]

.. (Optional) Set a custom communication port (4) for the Defender to use.

.. (Optional) Set a proxy (3) for the Defender to use for the communication with the Console.

.. (Optional) Under *Advanced Settings*, Enable *Assign globally unique names to Hosts* when you have multiple hosts that can have the same hostname (like autoscale groups, and overlapping IP addresses). 
+
NOTE: After setting the option to *ON*, Prisma Cloud appends a unique identifier, such as ResourceId, to the host's DNS name.
For example, an AWS EC2 host would have the following name: Ip-171-29-1-244.ec2internal-i-04a1dcee6bd148e2d.

.. Copy the install scripts command from the right side panel, which is generated according to the options you selected. On the host where you want to install Defender, paste the command into a shell window, and run it.

=== Install a single Host Defender (twistcli)

Use `twistcli` to install a single Host Defender on a Linux host.

ifdef::compute_edition[]
NOTE: Anywhere `<CONSOLE>` is used, be sure to specify both the address and port number for Console's API.
By default, the port is 8083.
For example, `\https://<CONSOLE>:8083`.
endif::compute_edition[]

*Prerequisites*:

* Your system meets all minimum xref:../../system-requirements.adoc[system requirements].
ifdef::compute_edition[]
* You have already xref:../../getting-started.adoc[installed Console].
* Port 8083 is open on the host where Console runs.
Port 8083 serves the API.
Port 8083 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing Console.
When deploying Defender, you can configure it to communicate to Console via a proxy.
* Port 8084 is open on the host where Console runs.
Console and Defender communicate with each other over a web socket on port 8084.
Defender initiates the connection.
Port 8084 is the default setting, but it is customizable when first installing Console.
When deploying Defender, you can configure it to communicate to Console via a proxy.
* You've created a service account with the Defender Manager role.
twistcli uses the service account to access Console.
endif::compute_edition[]
* Console can be accessed over the network from the host where you want to install Defender.
* You have sudo access to the host where Defender will be installed.
ifdef::prisma_cloud[]
* Create a Role with Cloud Provisioning Admin permissions and without *any* account groups attached. 
endif::prisma_cloud[]

[.procedure]
. Verify that the host machine where you install Defender can connect to Console.

  $ curl -sk -D - https://<CONSOLE>/api/v1/_ping
+
If curl returns an HTTP response status code of 200, you have connectivity to Console.
If you customized the setup when you installed Console, you might need to specify a different port.

. SSH to the host where you want to install Defender.

. Download `twistcli`.

  $ curl -k \
    -u <USER> \
    -L \
    -o twistcli \
    https://<CONSOLE>/api/v1/util/twistcli

. Make the twistcli binary executable.

  $ chmod a+x ./twistcli

. Install Defender.

  $ sudo ./twistcli defender install standalone host-linux \
    --address https://<CONSOLE> \
    --user <USER>

=== Verify the Install

Verify that the Defender is installed and connected to Console.

In Console, go to *Manage > Defenders > Defenders: Deployed*.
Your new Defender should be listed in the table, and the status box should be green and checked.
