== Reconfigure Prisma Cloud

In many cases, you will set up _twistlock.cfg_ before you install Prisma Cloud.
However, in some cases, you might want to change some parameters in _twistlock.cfg_ after Prisma Cloud has already been installed.
To reconfigure Prisma Cloud with an updated _twistlock.cfg_, run the _twistlock.sh_ installer script again.

[.procedure]
. Extract the release tarball to a new location on your host.
+
Make sure this location does not have any previous Prisma Cloud install files.
+
  $ tar -xvf twistlock_<VERSION>.tar.gz

. Update _twistlock.cfg_ with your new settings.

  $ vim twistlock.cfg

. Reload twistlock.cfg.

  $ sudo ./twistlock.sh onebox
+
This command assumes that both _twistlock.sh_ and _twistlock.cfg_ reside in the same directory.
To specify a configuration file in a different directory, use the -c option.
+
The old configuration is stored in _/var/lib/twistlock/scripts/twistlock.cfg.old_
