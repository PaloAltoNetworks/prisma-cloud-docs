== Integrate Prisma Cloud with GitHub

Prisma Cloud supports OAuth 2.0 as an authentication mechanism.
GitHub users can log into Prisma Cloud Console using GitHub as an OAuth 2.0 provider.

Prisma Cloud supports the authorization code flow only.

A CA certificate configured in *Manage > Authentication > System certificates > Certificate-based authentication to Console* is not supported in GitHub.

=== Prisma Cloud to GitHub user identity mappings

Create a Prisma Cloud user for each GitHub user that should have access to Prisma Cloud.

After the user is authenticated, Prisma Cloud uses the access token to query GitHub for the user’s information (user name, email).
The user information returned from GitHub is compared against the information in the Prisma Cloud Console database to determine if the user is authorized.
If so, a JWT token is returned.

[.procedure]
. Go to *Manage > Authentication > Users*.

. Click *Add User*.

. Set *Username* to the GitHub user name.

. Set *Auth method* to *OAuth*.

. Select a xref:../authentication/user-roles.adoc[role] for the user.

. Click *Save*.

. Test logging into Prisma Cloud Console.

.. Logout of Prisma Cloud.

.. On the login page, select *OAuth*, and then click *Login*.
