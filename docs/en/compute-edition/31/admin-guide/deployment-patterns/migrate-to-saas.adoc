== Migrating to a SaaS Console

If you are interested in moving from Prisma Cloud Compute Edition (self-hosted) to Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition (SaaS), contact Palo Alto Network Customer Support or your Customer Success Team to discuss the migration process in detail.

Points to consider:

* This is a one-time migration. 
* The direction is Prisma Cloud Compute Edition to Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition.
You cannot migrate from Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition to Prisma Cloud Compute Edition.
* If you have projects enabled with Prisma Cloud Compute Edition, you will need to break them apart and pick a single Console to migrate.
* Your Prisma Cloud Compute Edition Console version must exactly match the Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Console, which is always the latest version of Prisma Cloud Compute that is available.
