[#end-support]
=== End of Support Notifications

* Ubuntu 18.04 reached End of Standard Support May 31, 2023. If you still have devices in your fleet using Ubuntu 18, follow https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-18-04-eol-for-devices[Canonical's guidance to keep your devices up and running]. Starting with Newton Update 2, Prisma Cloud Compute is no longer tested on devices running Ubuntu 18 and no support for those devices is available.

[#addressed-issues]
=== Addressed Issues

//CWP-51616
* Fixed the connection issue whereby Prisma Cloud failed to retrieve image details for Docker registries and displayed `HTTP 429: Too Many Requests` error when scanning more than one Docker registry at a time.

//CWP-51013
* Fixed an issue where Defender failed to block containers and generated too many audit events with containers restarting frequently. This was fixed by decreasing the number of requests sent to the Console.

//CWP-51415
* Fixed issue in RHEL clusters running NodeOS where compliance checks didn't show any non-compliant alerts.
