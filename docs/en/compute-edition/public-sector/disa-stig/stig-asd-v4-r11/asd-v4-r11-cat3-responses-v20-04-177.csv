Code coverage statistics describes the overall functionality provided by the application and how much of the source code has been tested during the release cycle.

To avoid the potential for testing the same pieces of code over and over again, code coverage statistics are used to track which aspects or modules of the application are tested.

Some applications are so large that it is not feasible to test every last bit of the application code on one release cycle. In those instances, it is acceptable to prioritize and identify the modules that are critical to the applications security posture and test those first. Rolling over to test other modules later as resources permit. E.g., testing functionality that performs authentication and authorization before testing printing capabilities.

Application developers should keep statistics that show all of the modules of the application and identify which modules were tested and when. This will help testers to keep track of what has been tested and help to verify all functionality is tested.

V-70385,low,ASDV-PL-003215,SV-85007r1_rule,APSC-DV-003215,The application development team must follow a set of coding standards.,"Coding standards are guidelines established by the development team or individual developers that recommend programming style, practices and methods.  The coding standards employed will vary based upon the programming language that is being used to develop the application and the development team.

Coding standards often cover the use of white space characters, variable naming conventions, function naming conventions, and comment styles.  Implementing coding standards provides many benefits to the development process.  These benefits include code readability, coding consistency among both individual and teams of developers as well as ease of code integration.  

The following are examples of what will typically be in a coding standards document.  This list is an example of what one can expect to find in typical coding standard documents and is not a comprehensive list:

- Indent style conventions
- Naming conventions
- Line length conventions
- Comment conventions
- Programming best practices
- Programming style conventions

Coding standards allow developers to quickly adapt to code which has been developed by various members of a development team.  Coding standards are useful in the code review process as well as in situations where a team member leaves and duties must then be assigned to another team member.  

Code conforming to a standard format is easier to read, especially if someone other than the original developer is examining the code.  In addition, formatted code can be debugged and corrected faster than unformatted code.

Introducing coding standards can help increase the consistency, reliability, and security of the application by ensuring common programming structures and tasks are handled by similar methods, as well as, reducing the occurrence of common logic errors.",,"This requirement is meant to apply to developers or organizations that are doing application development work.
