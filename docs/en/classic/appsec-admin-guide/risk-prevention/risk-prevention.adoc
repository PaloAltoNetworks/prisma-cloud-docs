== Risk Prevention

Risk Prevention improves engineering productivity by proactively detecting misconfigurations during the code or build phase of application development. It implements security-by-design to prevent potential exploits due to secrets or credentials embedded in the code. In addition, it secures the software supply chain with a detailed SBOM, and prevents malware in container images. Furthermore, it manages and prevents open source vulnerabilities in Software Composition Analysis (SCA). Risk Prevention ensures that CI/CD pipeline tools (such as Jenkins and CircleCI) are securely configured. Through Risk Prevention, you gain the capability to address root causes, preemptively mitigate risks in code, and stop real-time cloud breaches using precise, context-aware and expert remediations.
