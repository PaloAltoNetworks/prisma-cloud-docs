=== Upgrading Console

To upgrade Console, rerun the install script for the latest version of Prisma Cloud.
Use this method for any Console that was originally installed with the _twistlock.sh_ script.

[.procedure]
. xref:../welcome/releases.adoc#download[Download] the latest recommended release.

. Unpack the downloaded tarball.
+
Optional: you may wish to unpack the tarball to a different folder than any previous tarballs.
+
  $ mkdir twistlock_<VERSION>
  $ tar -xzf prisma_cloud_compute_edition_<VERSION>.tar.gz -C twistlock_<VERSION>/
+
The setup package contains updated versions of _twistlock.sh_ and _twistlock.cfg_.

. Check the version of Prisma Cloud that will be installed:
+
  $ grep DOCKER_TWISTLOCK_TAG twistlock.cfg

. Upgrade Prisma Cloud while retaining your current data and configs by using the _-j_ option.
The _-j_ option merges your current configuration with any new configuration settings in the new version of the software.
+
You must use the same install target in your upgrade as your original installation.
There are two install targets: `onebox` and `console`, where `onebox` installs both Console and Defender onto a host and `console` just installs Console.
+
To upgrade your `onebox` install, run:
+
  $ sudo ./twistlock.sh -syj onebox
+
To upgrade your `console` install, run:
+
  $ sudo ./twistlock.sh -syj console

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage* and validate that Console has upgraded your Defenders.
