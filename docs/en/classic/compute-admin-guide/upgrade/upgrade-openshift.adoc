== OpenShift

Upgrade Prisma Cloud running in your OpenShift cluster.

First upgrade Console.
Console will then automatically upgrade all deployed Defenders for you.

If you've disabled Defender auto-upgrade or if Console fails to upgrade one or more Defenders, manually upgrade your Defenders.

[NOTE]
====
You must manually upgrade App-Embedded Defenders.

=== Upgrading Console

[.procedure]
. xref:../welcome/releases.adoc#download[Download] the latest recommended release to the host where you manage your cluster with _oc_.

. If you customized _twistlock.cfg_, port those changes forward to _twistlock.cfg_ in the latest release.
Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

. (Optional) If you're storing Twistlock images in the cluster's internal registry, pull the latest images from Twistlock's cloud registry and push them there.
Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

.. Pull the latest Prisma Cloud images using xref:../install/deploy-console/container-images.adoc[URL auth].

  $ sudo docker pull registry-auth.twistlock.com/tw_<ACCESS_TOKEN>/twistlock/defender:defender_<VERSION>
  $ sudo docker pull registry-auth.twistlock.com/tw_<ACCESS_TOKEN>/twistlock/console:console_<VERSION>

.. Retag the images so that they can be pushed to your

  $ sudo docker tag \
    registry-auth.twistlock.com/tw_<ACCESS_TOKEN>/twistlock/defender:defender_<VERSION> \
    docker-registry.default.svc:5000/twistlock/private:defender_<VERSION>
  $ sudo docker tag \
    registry-auth.twistlock.com/tw_<ACCESS_TOKEN>/twistlock/console:console_<VERSION> \
    docker-registry.default.svc:5000/twistlock/private:console_<VERSION>

.. Push the Prisma Cloud images to your cluster's internal registry.

  $ sudo docker push docker-registry.default.svc:5000/twistlock/private:defender_<VERSION>
  $ sudo docker push docker-registry.default.svc:5000/twistlock/private:console_<VERSION>

. Generate new YAML configuration file for the latest version of Twistlock.
Pass the same options to _twistcli_ as you did in the original install.
The following example command generates a YAML configuration file for the default basic install.
+
  $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli console export openshift \
    --persistent-volume-labels "app-volume=twistlock-console" \
    --service-type "ClusterIP"
+
If you want to pull the image from the internal registry:
+
  $ <PLATFORM>/twistcli console export openshift \
    --persistent-volume-labels "app-volume=twistlock-console" \
    --image-name "docker-registry.default.svc:5000/twistlock/private:console_<VERSION>" \
    --service-type "ClusterIP"
+
For other command variations, see the xref:../install/deploy-console/console-on-openshift.adoc[OpenShift 4] deployment guide.

. Update the Twistlock objects.

  $ oc apply -f twistlock_console.yaml

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Manage* and validate that Console has upgraded your Defenders.


// == TBD
//
// The upgrade procedure for Console blows away the Twistlock service account and creates a new one.
// The service account holds an image pull secret used to scan the internal registry.
// If you use the standard upgrade procedure, you need to manually reconfigure the registry scan settings with the new secret.
// This section should show how to do that.
