. Complete the onboarding cloud account wizard to use the service accounts and roles when configuring Compute.
These accounts and roles are collectively called credentials.

. Before using a credential it needs to become read-only in Compute.
To find the surfaced credentials open the *Compute* tab. You can only update or delete credentials in *Settings > Cloud Accounts*.
Deleting surfaced credentials in the *Compute* tab credentials store only removes them from the table.

. Go to to the *Compute > Defend > Authentication* tab.

. Click *Add Credential*.

. In *Type*, select *Prisma Cloud*.

. Select all credentials you want to use.
