== Lateral movement

Lateral movement incidents indicate that an attacker is using tools and techniques that enable movement between resources on a network.

=== Investigation

The following incident shows that netcat was used to establish a listener on port 9000.

This behavior is a probable precursor to creating a reverse shell, allowing network-based remote control of another resource.  

Your investigation should focus on:

* Determining how the process in the alert, such as _nc.openbsd_, was executed.
Review additional entries in Incident Explorer and other audits from the source, looking for unusual process execution, and explicit execution of commands.
* Reviewing container runtime audits to determine if the target successfully connected.
* If the target did successfully connect, determine what the attacker was able to do and if they were able to move further through the network.

=== Mitigation

After determining the cause of the process execution, resolve the problem, whether it be an exposed vulnerability, a configuration issue, or something else.

For additional protection, enable the _prevent_ or _block_ actions in the applicable runtime rules to take action when anomalous processes, such as _netcat_, are executed.
