== WAAS

WAAS (Web-Application and API Security, formerly known as CNAF, Cloud Native Application Firewall) is a web application firewall (WAF) designed for HTTP-based web applications deployed directly on hosts, as containers, application embedded or serverless functions. WAFs secure web applications by inspecting and filtering layer 7 traffic to and from the application.
