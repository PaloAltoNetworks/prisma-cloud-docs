==== Embed App-Embedded Defender Manually

Embed App-Embedded Defender into a container image manually. Modify your Dockerfile with the given configurations, download the App-Embedded Defender binaries into the image's build context, then rebuild the image.

*Prerequisites*

* At runtime, the container where you're embedding App-Embedded Defender can reach Console over the network. For Enterprise Edition, Defender talks to Console on port 443. For Compute Edition, Defender talks to Console on port 8084.
* The host where you are rebuilding your container image with App-Embedded Defender can reach Console over the network on port 8083.
* You have the Dockerfile for your image.

[.procedure]
. Log in to Prisma Cloud Console.
. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders > Manual deploy*.
. In Deployment method, select *Single Defender*.
. Select the Defender type as *Container Defender - App-Embedded*.
. Select the DNS name (configured in *Manage > Defenders > Names (SAN)* or public IP address that Defender will use to connect to Prisma Console.
. *Enable file system runtime protection* to allow the sensors to monitor file system events regardless of how your runtime policy is configured, and could impact the underlying workload's performance.
. Select *Deployment type* as *Manual*
