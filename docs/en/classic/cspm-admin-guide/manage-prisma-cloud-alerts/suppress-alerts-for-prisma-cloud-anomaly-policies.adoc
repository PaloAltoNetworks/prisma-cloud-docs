== Suppress Alerts for Prisma Cloud Anomaly Policies

Exclude resources from generating anomaly alerts on Prisma Cloud.

Use the *Anomaly Trusted List* to include the list of resources for which you do not want Prisma Cloud to generate xref:../prisma-cloud-policies/anomaly-policies.adoc#id31e46cf0-ad50-471b-b517-6a545b57521e[Anomaly Policies] alerts.

Within a list, you can choose the resource type or identifier such as cloud service name, domain, IP address, machine image ID, port, protocol, resource ID, subject name, or tag for which you want to suppress alerts and apply the list to a set of anomaly policies.

[NOTE]
====
Only users granted Policies Read permissions are able to view the Anomaly Trusted List on the Prisma Cloud administrative console. Navigate to *Settings > Access Control* to add the required permissions to view the Anomaly Trusted List.

For each resource type, refer to the xref:#id47fecd66-ebcf-4d0b-9c05-a4948ef28a0e[Resource Syntax for Trusted List] for details on the supported values. By default, the entries you add to the trusted list are excluded from generating alerts against any (all) cloud accounts that are onboarded to Prisma Cloud. If you want to select a specific cloud account, select an *Account ID* and *VPC ID*or set it to Any to exclude any account that is added to Prisma Cloud.
