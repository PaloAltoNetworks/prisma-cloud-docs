== Integrate Prisma Cloud with AWS Security Hub
Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with AWS Security Hub so that you can view and monitor your security posture on AWS Security Hub.

You can use AWS Security Hub as a central console to view and monitor the security posture of your cloud assets on AWS Security Hub.

Integrate Prisma® Cloud with AWS Security Hub for centralized visibility into security and compliance risks associated with your cloud assets on the AWS Security Hub console.

As part of the integration, Prisma Cloud monitors your assets on your AWS cloud and sends alerts about resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities directly to the AWS Security Hub console so that you have a comprehensive view of the cloud assets deployed on your AWS accounts.

. Modify an existing alert rule or create a new alert rule to specify when to send alert notifications. (See xref:../manage-prisma-cloud-alerts/send-prisma-cloud-alert-notifications-to-third-party-tools.adoc#idcda01586-a091-497d-87b5-03f514c70b08[Send Prisma Cloud Alert Notifications to Third-Party Tools].)
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have integrated an AWS Organization account with Security Hub on Prisma Cloud, it is considered as a standalone account. This means you will only receive alerts for the master account on Security Hub, not its child accounts. If you want to receive alerts for every child account linked to that master account, you must repeat Steps 1 through 3 and then configure alert rules for each account.
