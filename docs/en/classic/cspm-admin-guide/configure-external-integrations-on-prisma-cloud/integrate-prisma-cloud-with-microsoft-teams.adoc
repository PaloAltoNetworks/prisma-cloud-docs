== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Microsoft Teams
Learn how to integrate Prisma® Cloud with Microsoft Teams.

Microsoft Teams is a cloud-based team collaboration software that is part of the Office 365 suite of applications and is used for workplace chat, video meetings, file storage, and application integration.

Prisma® Cloud integrates with Microsoft Teams and monitors your assets and sends alerts on resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities either as they happen or as a consolidated summary card—determined by how you configure alert notifications. Each alert message is a webhook notification that includes details such as the cloud type, policy name, and the resource that triggered the alert and the message card indicates the severity with a red (high), yellow (medium) or gray (low) line to help you quickly assess alert severity.

This webhook channel helps consolidate alert notifications from Prisma Cloud in Microsoft Teams so that your operations team can review and take action on the alerts.
