== Integrate Prisma Cloud with Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)
Learn how to integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC).

Integrate Prisma™ Cloud with Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) for centralized visibility in to security and compliance risks associated with your cloud assets on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

You can set up this integration for a GCP Organization that you are monitoring with Prisma Cloud. The alerts generated by Prisma Cloud for GCP accounts based on your alert rule are posted to Google Cloud SCC. To show Prisma Cloud alerts in Google Could SCC for cloud accounts of other cloud types (such as AWS and Azure), contact Prisma Cloud support on the https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Prisma-Cloud/ct-p/PrismaCloud[Palo Alto Networks LIVE Community].
