== Add a New Compliance Report

//Generate Prisma Cloud compliance reports to see how well your cloud accounts in Google, AWS and Azure are adhering to compliance standards. Create reports to run immediately for online viewing or download, or schedule recurring reports so you can monitor progress of your cloud compliance over time.

Monitor your single or multi-cloud environment for adherence to mandated compliance standards, with Prisma Cloud’s compliance reporting tools. Create reports based on a cloud compliance standard for immediate viewing or download, or schedule recurring reports to continue monitoring compliance over time. Each report provides you with a co nsolidated view of cloud account compliance with a selected standard. The report lists resources and accounts currently monitored against the standard, and details their compliance status. Cloud resources are tracked for compliance against every section of a given standard and detailed findings for each section are included along with remediation for non-compliant sections. From the Compliance Reports dashboard, you can also view or download historic reports to study compliance trends. Follow the steps below to create a Compliance Report:
