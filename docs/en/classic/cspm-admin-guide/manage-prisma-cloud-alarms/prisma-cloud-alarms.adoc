== Prisma Cloud Alarms
// Learn how to use Prisma® Cloud alarms to efficiently review and resolve credit usage for licenses and system-level issues in your cloud environments.

Alarms notify you about system-level issues and errors in your cloud environments, and license management. 
These are notifications about the system failures on Prisma Cloud and are not related to Alerts. 
After you enable Alarms, Prisma Cloud automatically generates alarms related to external Integrations status, onboarded Cloud Accounts status, and license management that includes license usage and expiry, and when credit usage exceeds a configured threshold.

You can enable or disable Alarm Center on  xref:../manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/define-prisma-cloud-enterprise-settings.adoc[the Enterprise Settings] page.

Prisma Cloud administrators with the System Admin role have full access to Alarm Center and it’s functionalities. Account Group Admins can only log in, review alarms, and view the notification details. Account Group Admins can contact their Prisma Cloud System Admin to create notification rules.
