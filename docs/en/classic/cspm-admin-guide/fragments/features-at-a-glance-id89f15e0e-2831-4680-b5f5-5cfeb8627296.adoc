The default scan quota for each tenant is 1500 credits; this quota allows you to control how much data is scanned so that you can align your organizational DLP budget with the amount of data that is scanned. This 1500 credits limit is adjustable and you can open a support ticket with Prisma Cloud Customer Success to increase it and balance your costs, while also ensuring that you're using Prisma Cloud Data Security to scan the file types that you want to secure.
