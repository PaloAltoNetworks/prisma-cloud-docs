== Create a Network Exposure Policy

// Create network exposure policies in Prisma Cloud to monitor resources/assets in your AWS environment.

You have the ability to create network exposure policies based on your organizationâ€™s requirements. You can build a new network exposure policy based on the `config from network where` RQL query to monitor the network exposure of an asset across your cloud environment.

[.procedure]
. Select menu:Policies[Add Policy > Network].

. Enter your policy details.

.. Add the *Policy Name* and *Severity*.

.. *Description* and *Labels* are optional.

.. Click *Next*.

. Enter your RQL query in the search bar.
+
The default option of *New Search* enables you to build a new RQL query from scratch while *Saved Search* enables you to use a RQL query that you previously saved. For example, the following RQL query finds the interfaces that are accessible from any untrusted Internet source:
+
`config from network where source.network = UNTRUST_INTERNET and dest.resource.type = 'Interface' and dest.cloud.type = 'AWS' and dest.tag = 'env=prod'`
+
A green check mark indicates that you have a valid query and you can view the query results.

+
You cannot associate compliance standards to network exposure policies.

. *Save* the policy.
+
After you successfully create your new policy, it is displayed in the *Policies* table.
