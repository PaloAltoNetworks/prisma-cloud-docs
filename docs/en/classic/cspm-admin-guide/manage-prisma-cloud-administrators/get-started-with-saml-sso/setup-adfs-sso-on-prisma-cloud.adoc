== Set up ADFS SSO on Prisma Cloud

To secure administrator access to Prisma Cloud, go to ADFS to configure single sign-on (SSO) and then configure Prisma Cloud for SSO.

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a service provided by Microsoft as a standard role for Windows Server that provides a web login using the existing Active Directory (AD) credentials.

[CAUTION]
====
To avoid account lockout, you must enable a few administrative users with both local authentication credentials on Prisma Cloud and SSO access. Ensure that each administrator has activated their Palo Alto Networks Customer Support Portal (CSP) account using the Welcome to Palo Alto Networks Support email and set a password to access the portal.

When you configure SSO on AD FS, you must attach this role to the user‘s profile so that the user has the appropriate permissions and can monitor the assigned cloud accounts on Prisma Cloud.
