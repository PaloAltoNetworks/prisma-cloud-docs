== Set up Google SSO on Prisma Cloud

To secure administrator access to Prisma Cloud, set up Google as the Identity Provider (IdP) and then configure Prisma Cloud as the Service Provider (SP) for SSO.

On Prisma Cloud, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using Google. To enable SSO, you must first complete the setup on Google. You can then log in with System Administrator privilege on Prisma Cloud to configure SSO and redirect login requests to the Google login page so that your Prisma Cloud administrative users can log in using SSO.

[.procedure]
. Set up Google for SSO.

.. Before you begin to set up Google configuration, log in to your Prisma Cloud instance, select *Settings > SSO* and copy the Audience URI (SP Entity ID). For example: https://app.prismacloud.io/settings/sso[https://app.prismacloud.io/settings/sso].

.. Log in to https://admin.google.com/[Google Workspace] as a Super Administrator.

* *Identity Provider Issuer*—Enter the *Entity ID* value.
* *Certificate*—Enter the *Certificate* value in the standard X.509 format.
* tt:[(Optional)]  *Identity Provider Logout URL*—Enter the *SSO URL* value to which a user is redirected to, when Prisma Cloud times out or when the user logs out.

.. Select *Allow select users to authenticate directly with Prisma Cloud* to configure some users to access Prisma Cloud directly using their email address and password registered with Prisma Cloud, in addition to logging in using Google IdP.
+
When you enable SSO, make sure to select a few users who can also access Prisma Cloud directly using the email and password that is registered locally on Prisma Cloud to ensure that you are not locked out of the console in the event you have misconfigured SSO and need to modify the IdP settings. For accessing data through APIs, you need to authenticate directly to Prisma Cloud.

.. Select the *Users* who can access Prisma Cloud either using local authentication credentials on Prisma Cloud or using SSO.
+
The users listed in the allow list can log in using SSO and also using a local account username and password that you have created on Prisma Cloud.
