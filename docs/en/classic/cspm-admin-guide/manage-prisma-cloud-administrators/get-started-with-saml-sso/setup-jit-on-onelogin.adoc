== Set up Just-in-Time Provisioning on OneLogin
Configure SSO with Just-in-time Provisioning on OneLogin.

To successfully set up local administrators on the fly with Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning, you need to configure the Prisma Cloud app for OneLogin to provide the SAML responses that enable Prisma Cloud to add the authenticated SSO user on Prisma Cloud. Then, to ensure that the SSO user has the correct access privileges on Prisma Cloud, you need to assign a Prisma Cloud role to the user; if this role is not a default role on Prisma Cloud, you must define the role before you assign the role to the user on OneLogin.




[.procedure]
. Create the Prisma Cloud App for OneLogin.
+
If you have not already created the SAML app for Prisma Cloud on OneLogin, see xref:setup-sso-integration-on-prisma-cloud-for-onelogin.adoc#idc011bcde-1fa7-4759-bf86-d857aac95346[Setup OneLogin SSO on Prisma Cloud].

. For JIT, create a custom role in OneLogin.
+
.. Log in to OneLogin as an Administrator and select *Administration*.

.. Navigate to *Users > Roles*.

.. *New Role*.

.. Enter a *Name* for the Role. The role name should match the roles available on Prisma Cloud, for example System Admin.

.. Click the checkmark to register the role name and select the application to which this role will be made available.

+
.. In OneLogin, select *Administration*.

.. Navigate to *Users > Roles* and select the role to which you want to add the users.

.. Click *Users* and use automatic (filter-based) or manual-based option to add new users to the role.

. Validate JIT.
+
.. Log in to OneLogin portal as a user who is not yet provisioned in Prisma Cloud. Make sure all the attributes, including Prisma specific role has been configured for this user.

.. Click *Prisma App* from the dashboard to log directly in to the Prisma Cloud instance.

.. Log in to Prisma Cloud as an Administrator and select *Settings > Users* to validate that the above user is provisioned.
