== What is Prisma Cloud IAM Security?

// Learn why the IAM Security module helps you reduce risk and improve your security posture.

Prisma Cloud IAM security capabilities help you evaluate the effective permissions assigned to users, workloads, and data (also called entitlements) on your cloud provider so that you can properly administer identity and access management (IAM) policies and enforce access using the principle of least privilege.

IAM Security provides:

* *Visibility*—Improve the visibility of effective permissions to resources in the cloud accounts. The ability to query all relevant IAM entities including all the relationships between the different entities and the entities’ effective permissions across multiple cloud environments.

* *Governance*—Monitor excess and unused privileges, provide out-of-the-box (default) security best practices policies, and review cloud identity compliance posture.

* *Response*—Enables you to automatically adjust effective IAM permissions to take action and reduce risk.

//In addition, Prisma Cloud IAM module supports various SSO providers and their effective permissions to cloud resources. Using the Prisma Cloud Resource Query Language (RQL) you can create your own queries specifying one or more filters to get the visibility you are interested in. For example, you can answer questions such as: “Which users have access to resource X?”, “What accounts, services and resources does the user name@domain.com have access to?”, “Can any users outside of group C access resources in region D?”.

The IAM Security module runs a proprietary algorithm to calculate effective permissions of the users across your cloud service providers. For example, the algorithm combines various cloud sources such as AWS IAM roles, AWS IAM policies, AWS IAM groups, AWS resource based policies, and AWS service control policies (SCPs) to compute the net effective permissions of cloud resources. It extends the Config query in RQL ( `config from iam where` ) to help you gain visibility into the entities in your cloud environment.

For example, with the net effective permissions calculation you can now discover the permissions for a specific user in your AWS, Azure, or GCP environment, such as, a user who has access to a AWS S3 bucket, Azure storage account, or Google storage bucket.
