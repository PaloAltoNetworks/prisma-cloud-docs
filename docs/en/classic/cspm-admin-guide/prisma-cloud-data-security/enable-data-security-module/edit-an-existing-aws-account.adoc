. (tt:[Optional]) Follow this step only if the objects inside your S3 buckets are encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMK).
+
The step varies depending on whether the CMK is located within the same AWS account or a different one:
+
* When the CMK is in the same AWS account that you are onboarding, the Prisma Cloud role needs additional permissions to access the key. Add the following statement to the Prisma Cloud role and update the resources array with all the CMK ARNs:
+
[userinput]
----
{
    "Sid": "AllowPrismaCloudToAccessKeys",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:ap-south-123456789101:key/3269f3d0-1820-407f-b67e-73acdd9243f4"]
}
----

* When the CMK is in a different AWS account than the one that youâ€™re onboarding, you need to first add the following policy statement to all the CMKs that are used for encryption and update the *Principal AWS* field with the Prisma Cloud ARN:
+
[userinput]
----
{
            "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::726893731529:role/PrismaCloudReadOnlyRoleWithDLP"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
}
----
+
The PrismaCloudReadOnlyRoleWithDLP role refers to the Prisma Cloud Data Security role. This role needs additional permissions to access the key. Add the following statement to the Prisma Cloud role and update the resources array with all the CMK ARNs:
+
[userinput]
----
{
            "Sid": "AllowPrismaCloudToAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:kms:ap-south-123456789101:key/3269f3d0-1820-407f-b67e-73acdd9243f4"]
}

. Click *Next* and review the *Status* of the cloud account.
