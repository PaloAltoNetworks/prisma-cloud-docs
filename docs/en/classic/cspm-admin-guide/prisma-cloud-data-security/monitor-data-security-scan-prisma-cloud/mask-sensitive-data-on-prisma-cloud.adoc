== Mask Sensitive Data on Prisma Cloud

Prisma Cloud Data Security can now mask how data is stored in _snippets_. A snippet is a piece of data that matches the xref:data-policies.adoc#idd48115a7-0b21-41d1-aaeb-da15099564e9[] that you want to identify within your files. Snippet masking enables you to control how this sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers, displays to administrators who can view the snippet within Prisma Cloud.

[.procedure]
. Select menu:Settings[Data > Snippet Masking.]

. Select your masking option.
+
There are three types of masks that you can apply to your sensitive data. The default option is *Partial Mask* which displays only the last four characters in clear text such as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234. If you do not want to cloak sensitive data then you can toggle *Do not mask* which displays your data in plain text such as 1234-1234-1234-1234. The last option is *Full Mask* which cloaks all the values of the sensitive data such as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. When a mask is applied, 200 bytes before and after the pattern match is displayed.
