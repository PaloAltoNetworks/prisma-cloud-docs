== Data Dashboard
The Data Dashboard provides complete visibility into your S3 storage. The dashboard widgets below give you insight into how many storage buckets and objects you have, what kind of data is stored in those objects, across which regions, who owns what and what is the exposure of the objects. This tab is available under the Dashboard menu.
