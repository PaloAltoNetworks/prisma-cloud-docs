== Resource Explorer
The Resource Explorer provides you visibility into each cloud resource monitored by Prisma Cloud. The Resource Explorer for storage resources has been extended to show you all objects that belong to a particular resource. You can now view all objects with object name, object profile, object pattern, malware and exposure for each object. For example, you can see the Audit Trail and Objects tabs on the *Investigate* page by entering the following RQL:

* For AWS, `config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl'` or `config from cloud.resource where cloud.service = 'Amazon S3'` .

* For Azure, `config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = ‘azure’ AND cloud.service = 'Azure Storage'` .
