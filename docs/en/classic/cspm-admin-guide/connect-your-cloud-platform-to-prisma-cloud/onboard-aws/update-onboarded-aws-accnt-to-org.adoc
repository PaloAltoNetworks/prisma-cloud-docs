== Update an Onboarded AWS Account to AWS Organization

If you had previously onboarded an individual AWS account as type *Account* and now you want to onboard the same account as type *Organization*, you can do so without losing any changes to the onboarded account and assigned account groups.

[.procedure]
. On the *Cloud Accounts* page, identify the account which you want to update from *Account* to *Organization* type.
