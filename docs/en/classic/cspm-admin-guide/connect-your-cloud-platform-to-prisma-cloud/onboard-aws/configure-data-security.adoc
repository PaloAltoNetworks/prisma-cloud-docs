== Configure Data Security

In addition to scanning your AWS resources against Prisma Cloud policies for compliance and governance issues, you can also scan objects in AWS S3 buckets for data security issues. The data security capabilities include predefined data policies and associated data classification profiles such as PII, Financial, or Healthcare and Intellectual Property that scan objects stored in your S3 bucket to identify exposure—how sensitive information is kept private, or exposed or shared externally, or allows unauthorized access.
