== Workload Protection Policies
//Learn how to use workload protection policies to detect hosts and containers with vulnerabilities.

Prisma Cloud includes system default policies for protecting hosts and containers from runtime incidents and for detecting vulnerabilities on these workloads. 

[.task]
[#enable-workload-policy]
=== Enable Workload Policies

By default, the workload protection policies are disabled. You can enable these policies and use them in an alert rule for viewing alerts on runtime incidents and vulnerabilities.

[.procedure]
. On the *Policies* page, filter on the Policy Type *Workload Incident* and *Workload Vulnerability*.

+
These policies are assigned as Cloud Type *Any*, and cannot be cloned.

. Toggle the *Status* to enable the policies.
+
Click a policy to view the details. 
Each policy provides a read only view of the vulnerability management rules that power the protections. 
Use *Manage Rules*  to view the details on each rule on the *Compute* tab. You can use the system default rules or custom vulnerability https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/vulnerability_management/vuln_management_rules[rules].
+

For example, the *Hosts detected with known Vulnerabilities* policy has the corresponding rules on "Compute > Defend > Vulnerabilities > Host".

. Use the workload policy in an alert rule.

.. Review the summary and save your changes.

. Verify that the alert rule is working.
+
You must have the Defender installed on the host or container image.

.. Check for issues on a host or container image.
+
To check any vulnerabilities on a host, select "Compute > Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Hosts".

[.task]
[#use-alert-workload-filter]
=== Filter for Alerts Related to Workload Policies

After you create an alert rule, when a policy violation occurs, you can view the alert for the workload incidents and vulnerabilities along with all the other policies that detect run-time issues on the Prisma Cloud console.

[.procedure]
. Select "Alerts > Overview".

. Set the Filters for the alerts related to workload policies.
+
Most of the filters are easy to interpret and use. The following include specific for viewing alerts related to workloads, such as container images or hosts, that do not belong to cloud accounts which are onboarded on Prisma Cloud. 

* Cloud Account—Name of the cloud account if account is onboarded on Prisma Cloud; Choose *None* to filter on-premises workload resources.

* Cloud Account ID—Cloud Account ID of the cloud account if account is onboarded on Prisma Cloud; Choose *None* to filter on-premises workload resources.

* Cloud Service, Cloud Region, Cloud Type—Choose *Other* to filter container workloads.
