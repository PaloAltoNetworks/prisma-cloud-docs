== Event Query Attributes
Learn about Event Query attributes in RQL.

Review your options when using `event from cloud.audit_logs where` on the *Investigate* tab of the Prisma Cloud administrative console:

Each attribute allows you to narrow your search criteria. As you use these attributes, the auto-suggestion feature shows the available expressions and the xref:../operators.adoc#id7077a2cd-ecf9-4e1e-8d08-e012d7c48041[Operators] that are applicable for each attribute.

*  `alert.id` 
+
Use the `alert.id` attribute to view alert details on the *Investigate* tab.
+
For example, you can visualize the alert details for a set of alerts such as P-8444, P-8421, P-8420.
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where alert.id IN (‘P-8444’, ‘P-8421’, ‘P-8420’)`

*  `anomaly.type` 
+
Use the `anomaly.type` to view details on specific anomaly policies. The auto-suggestion displays the different anomaly policies that are supported with this attribute.
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where anomaly.type = 'Excessive Login Failures' `
+

*  `cloud.account` 
+
Use the `cloud.account` attribute to narrow down audit search to one or more cloud accounts that you connected to Prisma Cloud.
+
For example, you can list entities or users who deleted security groups from a given cloud account:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND operation IN ( 'DeleteSecurityGroup' )`

*  `cloud.account.group` 
+
Use the `cloud.account.group` attribute to narrow your search to only the cloud accounts in your cloud account group.
+
For example, you can list entities or users who deleted Virtual Private Clouds in all your AWS accounts:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where operation = 'DeleteVpc' AND cloud.account.group = 'All my AWS accounts' ``event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account.group = 'All my AWS accounts' AND cloud.service = 'autoscaling.amazonaws.com' AND user = 'maxusertest__gahp1Tho'  `

*  `cloud.type` 
+
Use the `cloud.type` attribute to narrow your search to a specific cloud platform. Supported options are AWS, Azure, and GCP.
+
For example, you can list all users who deleted S3 buckets:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.type = 'aws' AND cloud.service = 's3.amazonaws.com' AND operation = 'DeleteBucket'`

*  `cloud.region` 
+
Use the `cloud.region` attribute to narrow down audit search to one or more cloud regions.
+
For example, you can list entities or users who deleted access keys from a given cloud account:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account = 'Developer Sandbox' AND cloud.region = 'AWS Canada' AND operation IN ( 'DeleteAccessKey' )`

*  `cloud.service` 
+
Use the `cloud.service` attribute to search for information using a specific service name in your cloud accounts.
+
image::cloud-service-query-options-1.png[scale=60]
+
For example, you can review details for users who performed operations, such as deleting cloud trail logs or disabling or stopping logging events:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.service = 'cloudtrail.amazonaws.com' AND operation IN ( 'DeleteTrail' , 'DisableLogging' , 'StopLogging' )`

*  `crud` 
+
Use the `crud` attribute to search for information for users or entities who performed Create, Read, Update, or Delete operations.
+
You can list all Azure resources that were deleted:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account in ( 'Azure - Microsoft Azure Sponsorship' ) and crud = 'delete'`

*  `has.anomaly` 
+
Use the `has.anomaly` attribute to search for information on events that include anomalies.
+
For example, you can list all events that have identified anomalies for a cloud type:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.type = 'azure' AND has.anomaly `

*  `operation` 
+
An operation is an action performed by users on resources in a cloud account. Use the `operation` attribute to start typing the name of the operation in which you are interested and Prisma Cloud auto-completes a list of operations that match your search criteria.
+
For example, you can list details of delete operations on VPCs, VPC endpoints, and VPC peering connections:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where operation in ( 'DeleteVpc' , 'DeleteVpcEndpoints' 'DeleteVpcPeeringConnection' )`

*  `Subject` 
+
Use this attribute to search for actions that a specific user or an instance performed on your cloud account.
+
For example, you can list console login operations by Ben:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where operation = 'ConsoleLogin' AND subject = 'ben'`

*  `role` 
+
Use this attribute to filter the search results by role.
+
For example, you can look for events performed by the Okta role:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where role = ’OktaDevReadWriteRole’`

*  `json.rule` 
+
Use this attribute to filter specific elements included in the JSON configuration related to a cloud resource. The `json.rule` attribute enables you to look for specific configurations—parse JSON-encoded values, extract data from JSON, search for value within any configuration policy for cloud accounts that you are monitoring using Prisma Cloud.
+

+
Use the automatic suggest feature to see the available values for `json.rule` .
+
[NOTE]
====
The auto suggest works with the operators `=` and `IN` . It is not supported for array objects.

Use `cloud.type` attribute to refine the search results.
====
+
For example, you can check for login failures on the console:
+
`event from cloud.audit_logs where cloud.account = 'Sandbox' AND json.rule = $.responseElements.ConsoleLogin != 'Success'`
