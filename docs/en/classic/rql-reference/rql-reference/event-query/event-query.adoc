== Event Query
Use Event Query for insight into privileged activities, and suspicious or anamolous activities in your cloud environment.

Event queries help you to detect and investigate console and API access events, monitor privileged activities, detect account compromise, and detect unusual user behavior in your cloud environments.

To investigate events, use `event from cloud.audit_logs where` queries in the search box on the *Investigate* tab of the Prisma Cloud administrative console. The query uses the event data that Prisma Cloud ingested from the audit logs to help you learn who did what and when on your cloud assets.
