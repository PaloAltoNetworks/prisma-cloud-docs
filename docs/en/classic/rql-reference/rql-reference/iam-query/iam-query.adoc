== IAM Query


Prisma Cloud ingests various services and associated configuration data from AWS, Azure, GCP, and Alibaba cloud environments. Use the IAM Query to gain visibility into the permissions of cloud resources which is currently only supported for AWS. To investigate the visibility of the effective permissions, use the `config from iam where` query in the search box on the *Investigate* tab of the Prisma Cloud admin console.
