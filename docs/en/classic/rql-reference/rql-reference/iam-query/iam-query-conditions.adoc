== IAM Query Conditions

Get more garnular search results in your IAM queries, by applying conditions to the `config from iam where` query in your RQL search. Use conditions to minimize the exposure of a resource based policy by making it available only to an organization or specific account, or use it to minimize the access to a machine (EC2 instances or Lambda functions); for example, if a machine has publicly available permissions, you can add a condition to enable actions only to a specific IP address. 

xref:iam-query-attributes.adoc#idd31fd7aa-bbe1-4353-b872-d89d688dfc45[IAM Query Attributes] also includes the `grantedby.cloud.condition` attribute that assists with permissions queries where the policy statement may or may not contain conditions. For instance, the example below filters all results with the source IP address:

`config from iam where grantedby.cloud.policy.condition('aws:sourceIP') does not exist` 

Several additional operators are also supported to give you more flexibility on how filters are applied. The examples below show how they can be used with the  `config from iam where` query to apply conditions.
