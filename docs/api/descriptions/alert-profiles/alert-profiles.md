Manage alert profiles, which let you surface critical policy breaches by sending alerts to channels, such as email, Slack, and JIRA.

Alert profiles define which events should be sent to which channel.
Each profile declares:

* One or more recipients.
* One or more triggers, that raise alerts by sending messages on the configured channel.
