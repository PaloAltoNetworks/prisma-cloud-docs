Updates the vulnerability policy for serverless functions scanned in your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
All rules in the policy are updated in a single shot.

The policy set in this endpoint is enforced by the scanners in the Jenkins plugin and the `twistcli` command line tool.

This endpoint maps to the policy table in **Defend > Vulnerabilities > Functions > CI** in the Console UI.
