Updates the vulnerability policy for deployed container images.
All rules in the policy are updated in a single shot.

This endpoint maps to the policy table in **Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > Deployed** in the Console UI.


### cURL Request

Refer to the following example cURL command that overwrites all rules in your current policy with a new policy that has a single rule:

```bash
$ curl -k \
  -u <USER> \
  -X PUT 'https://<CONSOLE>/api/v<VERSION>/policies/vulnerability/images' \
  --data '{
   "rules":[
      {
         "name":"<RULE_NAME>",
         "collections":[
            {
               "name":"<COLLECTION_NAME>",
            }
         ],
         "alertThreshold":{
            "disabled":false,
            "value":4
         },
         "blockThreshold":{
            "enabled":false,
            "value":0
         },
         
         ...
         
      }
   ],
   "policyType": "containerVulnerability"
   
   ...
