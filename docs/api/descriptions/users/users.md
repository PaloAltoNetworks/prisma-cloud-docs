Administrative endpoint to create and manage users.
Assign roles and specify who has access to which projects and which collections.

User management with these endpoints is supported for Compute Edition (self-hosted) only.

If you integrated Prisma Cloud Compute Edition with an identity provider, use these endpoints to assign roles to individual users.
Note that groups are a better way to assign roles when you have a large number of users.
