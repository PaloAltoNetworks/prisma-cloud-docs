Downloads a list of impacted resources for a specific vulnerability in a CSV format.
This endpoint returns a list of all deployed images, registry images, hosts, and serverless functions affected by a given CVE.

You can use filters such as `cvssThreshold`, `severityThreshold`, or `collections` as query parameters to get desired results.

Consider the following observations:
- You cannot use new filters such as **severityThreshold** and **cvssThreshold** with the **collections** filter or when you're assigned with specific collections or accounts.

**cvssThresold**: Retrieves a list of vulnerabilities (CVEs) that matches the specified value of CVSS score or higher.
**severityThreshold**: Retrieves a list of vulnerabilities (CVEs) that matches the specified value of the severity threshold or higher.
**collections**: Retrieves a list of vulnerabilities (CVEs) that matches the specified collection name.
