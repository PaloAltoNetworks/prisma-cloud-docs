Updates the policy for images scanned in your continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
All rules in the policy are updated in a single shot.

The policy set in this endpoint is enforced by the scanners in the Jenkins plugin and the `twistcli` command line tool.

This endpoint maps to the policy table in **Defend > Vulnerabilities > Images > CI** in the Console UI.


### cURL Request

$ curl 'https://<CONSOLE>/api/v<VERSION>/policies/vulnerability/ci/images' \
  -X PUT \
  -u <USER> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d \
'{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "<RULE_NAME>",
      "collections":[
         {
            "name":"<COLLECTION_NAME>",
         }
      ],
      "alertThreshold":{
         "disabled":false,
         "value":4
      },
      "blockThreshold":{
         "enabled":false,
