### cURL Request

Refer to the following example cURL command that retrieves the scan reports for all images scanned using the Jenkins CI plugin or the twistcli tool:

```
$ curl -k \
  -u <USER> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X GET \
  https://<CONSOLE>/api/v<VERSION>/scans
```

To get the report of a specific scan, add query parameters to narrow the scope of the request.

The following cURL command retrieves the scan report for an image with a SHA256 ID of `sha256:f756e84300d8e53006090573dd33abe5b8cfac3e42d104fc4be37f435fe512f3`.
 
```
$ curl -k \
  -u <USER> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X GET \
  'https://<CONSOLE>/api/v<VERSION>/scans?imageID=sha256:f756e84300d8e53006090573dd33abe5b8cfac3e42d104fc4be37f435fe512f3'
```

A successful response returns the scan reports.
